	<section>

	<div class='bill'>TRANSPORT BILL</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promised the Committee that I would make a short statement on the events of the Division during our previous sitting. I have taken advice and understand that the analogy is simply with the situation in the House itself. It is quite common for the person in the Chair of the House to order the doors to be locked and for hon. Members to get into the Division Lobby after that order has been given but before the action has occurred—they push through the doors. I understand that on that analogy it is permissible for an hon. Member to push through before the doors have been locked in Standing Committee, too. In that respect, therefore, the Division was valid. It is, of course, true, and somewhat unfortunate, that there was a delay in locking the doors, and the cause of that are being dealt with by other means. I hope that the Committee will not wish to go into that in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. I wish to make a personal statement. With the permission of the Committee, and through you, I apologise for any inconvenience I may have inadvertently caused the Committee during the Division on the closure motion on Tuesday. Representations have been made to the Speaker, and to the police authorities in the House, so that they are aware of what took place. A request has been made that the officer concerned should not carry any blame whatever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must all thank the hon. Gentleman for that statement and I suggest that that is where we leave the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the statement and do not wish to comment on it, in accordance with tradition in these matters, Mr. English. We are concerned about the matter and the statement that has been made properly and fairly clarifies the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards your statement, Mr. English, we accept that there will be a differ-
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
ence between the time you call for the doors to be locked and when that is done. I can recall incidents when hon. Members have actually fought their way into the Lobbies through their devotion to duty. However, we note that this is very unlikely to occur again, and we accept the statements that have been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>CLAUSE 1</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>Preliminary</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Amendment No. 34 proposed</i> [18 December], in page 2, line 22, leave out subsection (3)—[
	<i>Mr. Booth.</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must advise the Committee that we are considering also the following amendments:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 44, in page 2, line 22, leave out subsection (3) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Part I of this Act shall from the commencement date take effect as if it were contained in Part HI of the 1960 Act as amended by this and previous Acts. Part III of the 1960 Act will then become subject to section 35 of this Act for interpretation."</p></blockquote>
No. 35, in page 2, line 27, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"without prejudice to subsection (3)."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The deliberations of our last sitting were so pungent and so hot that apparently it has not been possible to print the report of them. I do not want to risk repeating all my remarks, from the last sitting. To avoid causing any offence to the Committee I shall refrain from doing so. No doubt there will be many sighs of relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the matter in hand on subsection (3) and the argument that it complicates the Bill, that it does not make matters clear, or help anyone. In considering clause 1(3) one must also refer to clauses 34 and 35, because they complicate the matter further. In my view, the amendment to delete subsection (3) is very relevant and can only be helpful. If subsection (3) remains, people reading the measure when it is enacted will be confused anyway, but the subsection will be the ultimate confusion. It can be construed in whatever way one wishes to construe it. I am sure I could find in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
Library some 1,000 enactments where this measure might or might not be valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Under-Secretary has listened carefully to our arguments, and I hope that he will find it in his heart, with the early spirit of Christmas descending upon us, to accept the amendment. He will thereby remove the utter confusion from the Bill and do a great service to those outside this House who will have to construe and operate the legislation. Doubtless they would give a cheer if he were to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary will have studied amendment No. 44 and will appreciate that my hon. Friends and I are seeking to help him out of the considerable difficulty which has arisen in subsection (3). We cannot get him out of the difficulties that have arisen in other parts of the clause, because he and the Minister have steadfastly refused to co-operate. But here I assume that we shall have reasonable cooperation from a reasonable man.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary said to my Hon. Friend—I cannot quote his words, because 
	<i>Hansard</i> is not available—that he could give information but not understanding. We appreciate that people cannot give what they do not have. But in this instance we are seeking to write into the Bill an understanding which I believe fits in with his description of the intention which he and his right hon. Friend the Minister had when they instructed the parliamentary draftsmen to draw up this subsection. I believe that the words we have chosen make the intention reasonably clear. The amendment says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Part I of this Act shall from the commencement date take effect as if it were contained in Part III of the I960 Act as amended by this and previous Acts,"</p></blockquote>
The Parliamentary Secretary advised us that the words "previous Acts" covered probably only two Acts which have amended the 1960 Act. The amendment goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Part III of the 1960 Act will then become subject to section 35 of this Act for interpretation."</p></blockquote>
That is a reasonably clear statement of the intention. It avoids many of the considerable difficulties one has in seeking to divine the intention of subsections (3) and (4) as presently drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tested the wording on a number
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
of good parliamentary lawyers. One said, "I think that has a meaning. I am not sure what it is. It is even conceivable that it would have the same meaning as that of amendment No. 44."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, we do not want people to have difficulty understanding the legislation that emanates from this Committee. Whatever arguments there might be as to the merits or the demerits of the Bill, and whatever might be our arguments as to the purpose of the Bill, let us do a professional parliamentary job and see that when the Bill leaves the Committee it is at least in language that can be understood by our legislators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand that some lawyers may have a vested interest in legislation not being clear, but they are not uppermost in our minds. The House has been concerned for some time about that issue in such clauses as this. You, in particular, Mr. English, will recall that a Committee was set up to consider the way in which our legislation was framed and to consider this type of measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the Committee's recommendations, as I recollect, was that there should be a clause, such as the one before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to come to that point, but first I shall deal with the part of the report that considers specifically the question of how clear the intentions, wording and meaning of the Bill should be. I quote selectively from paragraph 11.5 of the report of the Committee appointed by the Lord President of the Council and which sat under the chairmanship of Sir David Renton. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An unfortunate subject may be driven to litigation because the meaning of an Act was obscure which could, by a few extra words, have been made plain."</p></blockquote>
I think that we should take that to heart. As you have said, Mr. English, one of the considerations that that Committee went on to tackle was whether a Bill should include a clause to define the purpose of the Bill and give guidance. It is remarkable, in view of our experience in this Committee, to read in the report that such a clause would have
	<br><blockquote><p>"advantages at the parliamentary stage, since a purpose clause can be amended (or omitted) exactly like any other clause."</p></blockquote>
Our experience has flown in the face of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>
that statement. We have faced the most appalling difficulties and obstruction when we have sought to amend that clause exactly as any other. On the debate on clause stand part we shall probably have to express a view about the clause that we should not have had to express, had we been able to do exactly what that report suggested. We have certainly not been able to amend the clause in regard to the Bill's purpose. We have been able to amend only in regard to the Bill's content—which is very different from purpose, particularly in a clause that, by its very wording, exists to define purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But that is not the point that I seek to cover now. I wish to deal with the point made in the report about the importance of clarity. It expressed the importance of ensuring that no citizen in this land will be driven to complex, difficult and expensive litigation as a result of a failure of Members of this House to make clear their meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may save time in Committee if the Parliamentary Secretary, in replying to that point, will confirm whether amendment No. 44 makes clear the meaning that he described in our debate on a previous amendment to delete subsection (3). If it does make it clear, perhaps he could indicate what justification there could be for not deleting subsection (4). Has subsection (4) any meaning, given that amendment No. 44 defines clearly the way the legislation should be interpreted, should it be passed in its present form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport 
	<div class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always grateful for attempts to clarify the wording of legislation. It is a sensible purpose to which Standing Committees should turn more often to try to improve legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In defence of lawyers—including my hon. Friend the Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port (Mr. Porter)—I should mention that it is a popular myth that lawyers prefer obscure legislation because it gives rise to litigation. Most lawyers spend their time complaining about obscure legislation because it is an impediment to their work. Those lawyers who come to Parliament tend to arrive full of hope that something can be done to improve it. They find after a short time that in practice, little improvement occurs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
It seems to me that the House of Commons continues to pass legislation, often phrased in curious language, normally on the advice that precedent demands it—those precedents are usually bad—and that courts and lawyers demand it for the sake of clarity. Yet judges sometimes denounce Parliament for handing down incomprehensible legislation. Certainly road transport, it has been one of the worst-affected areas in the past. However, altering the position is easier said than done. One has the difficulty of drafting, which is a time-consuming process and is full of pitfalls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, clause 1(3) is one part of the Bill that does not deserve the strictures that I have just passed concerning legislation as a whole. On reading the clause, I cannot see a difficulty in understanding it. I explained in our last sitting that its intended effect is to make sure that the licensing law is seen to be embodied in two pieces of legislation—part III of the 1970 Act and part I of this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To make sure that they are construed in the same way and interpreted together, this small subsection states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Part and the 1960 Act shall be construed and have effect as if this Part…were contained in Part III of that Act".</p></blockquote>
It then refers to clause 35, which is the interpretation clause, and points out that it will apply to all the terms interpreted in it in respect both of the 1960 Act and this Bill. I am surprised that that has defeated those eminent lawyers in the House of Commons to whom the right hon. Gentleman has shown the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 44, which illustrates the pitfalls that can occur in amateur drafting—indeed, it has happened to me during my Parliamentary career. I shall try to show what is wrong with the wording chosen by the Opposition to try to improve subsection (3). First, the amendment refers to the commencement date. However, there is no specific commencement date in the Bill and therefore clearly there is nothing to which the amendment can refer in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Different provisions in Part I of the Bill will come into operation on different dates, according to orders made under clause 57(5). That is the first technical defeat. The words
	<br><blockquote><p>"as amended by this and previous acts."</p></blockquote>
are unnecessary and superfluous, because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
section 20(2) of the 1978 interpretation Act makes clear that any references to an Act are to be taken to mean that Act as amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point of the amendment seems to be to leave out the words in brackets in subsection (3)—which so worried the Opposition in our last debate. However, the result of leaving that out would give the impression that an Act of Parliament can somehow amend itself, which it cannot. Any amendments to the 1960 Act must result from the provisions of this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If any amendments or repeals contained in this Bill were to be regarded as part of the 1960 Act, some rather odd results could occur. That Act would then be regarded as containing repeals or amendments to its own provisions and it could also be taken to include repeals of, for instance, the Minibus Act 1977—yet that Act was passed 17 years later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be a pedantic point and one that would not much trouble anyone interpreting the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then why bother to put it in?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is nonsense to write into a Bill a provision whereby repeals to an Act of 1960 or of 1977 are to be regarded as if they were part of—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying carefully to follow the logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument. If he is correct in stating that references to an Act will always be taken by a court to mean the Act as amended by subsequent legislation, what possible justification can there be for the inclusion of this part of the Bill? Subsection (3) seems to be designed to suggest that we leave the 1960 Act in the form in which it is amended by the legislation. The purpose that the Minister has mentioned is totally superfluous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A large number of sections in the 1960 Act are not amended or repealed. They will remain law. They will be the surviving parts of part III of the 1960 Act. Some of part III of the 1960 Act will stand unamended and unrepealed by the Bill. The amendment makes it clear that those parts of the 1960 Act and part I of the Bill should be treated as one and the same enactment. One com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
mon interpretation should be applied to the words of art in both pieces of legislation, interpretation being derived from clause 35.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me illustrate the arguments one gets into when drafting amendments, amendment No. 44 refers to a commencement date, when there is no such thing in the Bill. That is a vital technical defect. I also believe that the other amendments show technical defects. I do not think that the amendment is an improvement on a subsection that was not considered difficult or doubtful until the Opposition, debating largely among themselves for the best part of an hour, succeeded in casting doubt and confusion on the whole issue. I do not think that it will cause difficulty to anyone who comes to it afresh. The courts and the authorities, when they come to construe it, will have the advantage of not being troubled by the points raised by the Opposition. I do not think that they will find any great difficulty in understanding or applying the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot respond to the invitation from the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans). So far, in our four sittings I have been in the happy position of not having had to ask the Committee to reject a single amendment. However, I must now advise my hon. Friends to reject all three amendments, if they are thought worth pressing to a division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the eyes of reasonable men the Minister could not take any credit for accepting the amendments that have been put before the Committee. He is well aware that he and his right hon. Friend have done nothing whatever to assist in bringing forward amendments on which we could debate the differences between us on the clause. The only amendments that he has accepted have been so painfully obvious—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have been over that ground. May I suggest that the right hon. Member restricts himself to this amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, Mr. English. As always I shall be guided by you. I hope that the stricture is a general one, as I am certain that it is, and that the Minister will apply it to himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He talks of our debating the matter between ourselves. I hope that he will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
release some of his hon. Friends from their vows of silence and I hope that they will show some pride in their position as members of the Committee and express concern about the way in which the Bill is constructed. I hope that they will join in the debate and try to persuade the Parliamentary Secretary that, although what we say in Committee about the clause may not have subsequent effects on court judgments, the way in which the Bill emerges from the House will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary's objection to the drafting is based on two things, if I have understood him correctly. First, it refers to a commencement date, rather than dates. If that is the case, and if the Bill does not provide a commencement date, I suggest that there might be some deficiency in the Bill. If it is at all important to define the time when one starts to interpret in this way, the present wording is deficient. It does not indicate when the change should take place. I should be happy to withdraw the reference to commencement dates in exchange for an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that by Report he will have put down an amendment to the same effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later in our proceedings, we can discuss the difficulty of how one couples two pieces of legislation to be read together without saying when that shall happen. Is one entitled to assume that, in so far as this Bill will amend other legislation, that is a matter for this Bill, and that when it is read in conjunction with the 1960 Act one is concerned only with those parts of part III of that Act which are left unamended? That is a possible construction to put on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if we do that, we shall be referring only to a small part of the 1960 Act. Conservative Members who have considered breaking their vows of silence and joining in the debate about the Bill will have looked at the 1960 Act. Part III deals with public service vehicles and the provisions covering the meanings of "Public service vehicle", "stage carriage", and so on, will be repealed. Sections 127 to 133, dealing with
	<br><blockquote><p>"Licensing of Public Service Vehicles",</p></blockquote>
are also to be repealed, with the sole exception of section 131,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Certificates of fitness for experimental vehicles",</p></blockquote>
which is scarcely an essential element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
The sections dealing with road service licences and with appeals in connection with licences are also to be repealed in their entirety. Of the remaining sections, dealing with drivers, conductors and passengers, and general and supplementary matters, about half are to be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, given the construction that the Parliamentary Secretary puts on the matter, we are now talking about a small vestige, a shadow, of the former part III of the 1960 Act. I return to one of my original points. If legislation does not have to refer to amendments and the courts will always accept that a reference to an Act is a reference to that Act as amended by subsequent legislation, why is it necessary for subsection (3) to say
	<br><blockquote><p>"except so far as it textually amends any enactment"?</p></blockquote>
That refers to amendments of the 1960 Act and other legislation by this Bill. Its only possible logical purpose is to isolate those parts of part III of the 1960 Act that remain, and to say that those and those only should be read in conjunction with part of the Bill. That method stretches beyond the reasonable imagination of hon. Members the broader justification given by the Parliamentary Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary is the secret draftsman, and has a parental concern at seeing his own child attacked. His response rather suggests that. Or perhaps he has risen in defence of the servants of his Department—a most laudable action on the part of any Minister. But while we might applaud him for defending his child, or a servant of his Department, I am afraid that we have a wider responsibility to the British public, who will be affected by this. The British public requires a clear statement of intent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary is a great disappointment to the Labour side of the Committee. The world is divided into two sorts of people: simplifiers and complicaters. Parliamentary draftsmen are among the complicaters of the world. If the man in the street in Britain is to be law-abiding, he should be able to understand the law, and the law on transport is no exception. The wording of measures such as subsections (3) and (4) is one of the things that makes political life more remote from the man in the street.

I do not have the 
	<i>Official Report</i> of the last sitting, but I remember that the Parliamentary Secretary said that subsections (3) and (4) provided a neat solution to the difficulty. I see nothing neat about them. Clause 1 is like an unpruned shrub.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised at the Parliamentary Secretary for another reason, although now he has told us that he is a lawyer I understand a great deal more. The Parliamentary Secretary said that it is a myth to say that there is a conspiracy of lawyers behing clauses such as this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I first became familiar with the idea of conspiracy through the founder of the modern Conservative party, Benjamin Disraeli. He was a lawyer. I read Disraeli's works quite widely. I do not know quite what they are doing to me. He said that lawyers were like people in ancient China who dug holes in the road in order to be paid to show people around them in the dark.

The parliamentary draftsmen who hand down the tablets of stone in these matters have an elegant line in circumlocution. Subsections (3) and (4) are a good example of their style. I do not know what the man in the street will make of them.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support amendment No. 44, which strikes me as being a Windus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our last sitting the Parliamentary Secretary gave a simple explanation of subsections (3) and (4). At that time I thought that if we were to make a stand against parliamentary draftsmen and their complicated language, we should realise that power was in the hands of the shop floor and make our stand. I had considered holding a short meeting after the Committee's proceedings today and appointing the Parliamentary Secretary as our shop steward in these matters, but he has been a profound disappointment to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir David Renton was a very well respected Back Bencher. When, years ago, he sat on a Committee to simplify parliamentary language he made a number of valuable recommendations. I am sorry to say in opposing the clause that his work has been in vain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 9.</p>

	<p>gave us some guidance when we were in considerable difficulty over the question of the amendments which we were to debate. If my recollection is correct, Mr. English, you indicated that there were at least two major considerations which would determine whether we would be debating amendments which had been tabled. The first consideration was whether the amendments were in order,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
and you made clear that we would not be debating any that were not as you would not select them. The second consideration was a matter of the convenience of debate and you said
	<br><blockquote><p>"Actually, all selections are made provisionally and usually discussed in Committee with the two Front Benches and with the Back Benches on both sides, and the Chair naturally tries to select amendments for the convenience of debate."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H.</i> 13 December 1979; c. 67.]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>May I ask you, Mr. English, for further guidance on this point? If in further proceedings on the Bill, as in proceedings up until now, it is not possible to reach the normal understandings between the Front Benches on approach, may we approach you individually to try to resolve the difficulty, because, quite clearly, we do not want to go into another year on the Bill facing these same sort of difficulties? Will you confirm that that is the case, and, failing any understanding between the sides as to submissions which might be made to you about such convenience, give us some guidance as to what will take place in those circumstances?</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I say quite unreservedly that I am always open to consider any point made by any member of the</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first deal with the point that has dogged the first four meetings of the Committee and with which we specifically said we would deal when we came to the clause stand part debate. It concerns the nature of the clause, and why it is in the Bill and the precedents for its being there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a statement of purpose of the Bill as a whole, designed to aid understanding of it and to assist—if there are doubts about later provisions—in interpreting those provisions when disputes come before an authority or before the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Renton committee has been referred to. It was the Committee on the Preparation of Legislation, Command 6053, presented to the House in May 1975. Pages 62 and 63 of the report contained passages in "statements of purpose," paragraphs 11.6 onwards. I quote the conclusions of that distinguished Committee on the proper place of such statements of purpose;
	<br><blockquote><p>"11.8 We agree that statements of purpose can be useful, both at the parliamentary stage and thereafter, for the better understanding of the legislative
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
intention and for the resolution of doubts and ambiguities."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to recommend:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that statements of purpose should be used when they are the most convenient method of delimiting or otherwise clarifying the scope and effect of legislation;</p></blockquote>
The second recommendation is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that when a statement of purpose is so used, it should be contained in a clause in the Bill and not in a preamble."</p></blockquote>
That is what has been done in this legislation. It is therefore in line with the recommendations of the Renton Committee. It seems that the best precedent to choose to illustrate that this has been done in recent times is the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. I believe that the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) was one of the Ministers responsible for the preparation and steering of that legislation. Section 1 of that Act is the preliminary section beginning:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The provisions of this Part shall have effect with a view to—"</p></blockquote>
And then follows a list of the general purposes of the Bill. Like ours, it is not an exhaustive list. It is an outline list of the principal purposes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might be able to save a great deal of the Parliamentary Secretary's time and that of the Committee. It has never been my contention, or that of any of my hon. Friends, that one should not start a Bill with a list of its purposes. I have already indicated that we think that that may have a valuable part to play in certain legislation. Our argument with him—and I hope he will address himself to this point—is that he and his right hon. Friend have sought to defeat the major advantage of having a statement of purpose at the beginning of the Bill by refusing to co-operate in enabling the Committee to debate those purposes. The Renton report clearly considered that to be one of the advantages of proceeding in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not believed to be an advantage at all. It was put in as a statement of purpose—as I have just described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the Opposition were not able to get any of their amendments in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
order and had difficulty in amendments being selected at the first sitting—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Chairman. Is a Minister entitled to say, in the light of your previous ruling, that the Opposition were not able to get any of their amendments in order? It was indicated to us that that was only one of the considerations, and that a number of amendments on the Amendment Paper may have been completely in order, but not selected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is perfectly correct that not every amendment which is not selected is out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the selection did not include all the amendments that the Opposition wanted, and the fact that a large number were—as I understand it—out of order, is not the responsibility of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of tabling critical amendments, I am a spectator of the legislation. Clause 1 of the Bill seems infinitely amendable. We have debated amendments and have, in fact, accepted two. But there is a limit to the number of amendments that the Opposition can draft and table that are in order, and there is a limit to the number that can be selected for debate. The idea that somehow the Government contrived that, and that it was our intention, in beginning with a preliminary clause, to cut the Opposition out of debate as they claim is entirely wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not prolong the argument about whether or not the Minister co-operated. That is a matter where people will judge on the facts, as we have made clear to the Committee. What is not in doubt is that the clause has been amended. The Minister has now done us the service of looking back on the precedents in legislation for which we have continued to press him, because he said at an earlier stage that there were precedents and that he would wait until the debate on clause stand part to quote them. I did not know what those precedents in legislation were. I looked at all the roads legislation but could not see any such precedents there. If there had been, I am sure that the Minister would have produced a piece of transport legislation for
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
us, but I certainly could not find it. Therefore, I am not sure whether there were difficulties about amending the 1974 Act when it was a Bill. I assume that the Minister has followed through his investigations. Can he inform us whether there were difficulties at that time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not done that research. The remedy, however, is easily to hand. The hon. Member has only to turn to his right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth), who was the Minister in charge of that Bill. His right hon. Friend has the great advantage over us all of having contended in the past with amendments and discussion on a clause of the sort that we are considering. It may be that as a Minister on that occasion the right hon. Gentleman pointed out the difficulties of clause 1 being taken first, and of this type of clause being amended, but my understanding is that that was not so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quoted that one precedent. There are others. But as I understand it, having listened to the right hon. Gentleman, the ground is not now that this sort of clause at the beginning of a Bill is somehow wrong, and there is no controversy between us about the general desirability of beginning with a statement of purpose. That certainly seems to be the position of the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that case, the constitutional and other difficulties that were at first foreseen by the Opposition do not arise because this method of proceeding, and of beginning a Bill, is in line with the recommendations of the authoritative Select Committee report and in line with precedents. If it is a precedent which has been introduced to the transport field from, among other sources, the record of the Department of Employment when the right hon. Gentleman was there, it is an improvement to transport legislation, and I do not think that it will be an obstacle to the interpretation and use of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are about to launch a debate on the general purposes of the clause and, naturally, I will take note of all the points raised on that, so I will not dilate at length upon it now. But clause 1(1) is a general statement of the, in our view, desirable objectives of the legislation as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards bus licensing, the key is probably paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) which shows the underlying intention of the legislation to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
make it easier for applicants to obtain road service licences. We believe that conditions in the passenger transport industry have changed dramatically since the present licensing arrangements were first made. The arrangements have not changed and, instead of being a protection of the public interest, they are often a somewhat bureaucratic obstruction to changes in passenger transport provision, and to innovation, whether by existing or new operators. The key alteration in the Bill will be to change the burden of proof before the traffic commissioners when they consider the introduction of new services or new types of service and unless an objector can show that it is contrary to the travelling public's interest to have a new service introduced, the commissioners will be enjoined to grant a licence. We believe that that will be a welcome improvement in a system which has become rather ossified as a result of past legislation and practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of convention and precedent has sprung up around the practices of traffic commissioners and their licensing powers. Learned tomes are available setting out the practice in these matters, based upon long, irrelevant precedents relating to traffic conditions which no longer obtain. Anyone who has seen a list of the proceedings before traffic commissioners or who has discussed with an operator the procedures that must be followed even for a minor change in the timetable or a change in fares will realise that the process requires simplification and needs to be changed to encourage innovation and experiment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have touched upon fare control, which is also dealt with in paragraph (
	<i>c</i>). We do not propose to do away with all powers to control fares, but we think that it should be a residual power, used by the commissioners only in limited circumstances. The detailed fare fixing which goes on at present serves no worthwhile purpose either to the operators or to the travelling public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Few members of the public believe that the traffic commissioners' fare control has had any great consequences. However, we envisage the traffic commissioners in rare cases using their fare control powers where there is an abuse of monopoly, where one operator is so well established as to have a monopoly of a busy route and is for some reason pushing fares higher than necessary, or where there is destructive undercutting on fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
For example, two routes may have a common part at some point, but otherwise serve different communities. Competitive undercutting by one operator along the most profitable section of the route could drive the other operator out of business, thus depriving other communities of service which otherwise would be provided. Other examples can be cited of destructive fare cutting which would be against the public interest. A residual power is therefore left for the traffic commissioners to deal with that when it occurs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the introduction of operator licensing will improve quality control of bus licensing. I think that all members of the Committee agree that, whatever one may say about quantity licensing—and I have put our case on that, with the need to encourage innovation and new operators—there must be no weakening of legislation on quality control and the safety of the public. We believe that the proposed system of operator licensing will act as a barrier to the incompetent, unsafe, unsuitable or financially unsound operator. When we consider those parts of the Bill in detail, we shall find that suggestions that the Bill is some kind of cowboys' charter or will encourage irresponsible operators are entirely untrue. The requirements relating to those who operate passenger transport and the safety of their vehicles will be as strong as, and in some respects stronger than, they are under existing legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that phrases such as "set free" and "more flexible", are precisely the sort of language that was used when his party reduced licensing controls on lorries in previous legislation. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has read the Foster Committee report, which has reviewed the subject and makes clear that a reduction in standards has occurred due to the same sort of relaxation of control on lorries that the Government now propose for buses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman is an advocate, or appeared to be on Second Reading, of quantity licensing for lorries—a concept proposed in 1968, but long since abandoned as impracticable. I do not believe that anybody, apart from the hon. Gentleman, is recommending a return to quantity licensing, however, no member of the Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
is using phrases like "set free" or "more flexible" with regard to safety control for lorries or buses. We are talking about firm control in the public interest. The changes with regard to buses in this Bill, as compared with the previous Bill, involve, if any thig, a slight strengthening of the protection for the public. We also seek to protect the public in other ways in terms of the safety of coaches and buses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the clause is to give a description of those general purposes. The remaining cluases comply with the descriptions set out in clause 1. Therefore I suggest that this is an entirely appropriate first clause to put into our legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not disagree more with what the Parliamentary Secretary has said. I turn first to the theoretical justification for the inclusion of a clause such as clause 1. It is supposed to make matters easier to understand for those who are to operate the legislation and, ultimately, for lawyers and senior lawyers who are commonly known as judges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause seems to be suspect in a number of respects. We have had a number of quotations from the Renton committee report. Sir David Renton was a lawyer, which makes the recommendations of his committee suspect in regard to the law as it applies to ordinary human beings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already heard a quotation from the Renton report at paragraph 11.7 that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"First Parliamentary Counsel takes the view that 'in many cases the aims in the legislation cannot usefully or safely be summarised or condensed', and that 'there may be a temptation to call for something which is no more than a manifesto, and which may obscure what is otherwise precise and exact'".</p></blockquote>
I believe that, if the Opposition achieve their intentions on the remaining clauses of the Bill, we would have precise and exact legislation. As stated in the Renton report, clause 1 is really nothing more than a manifesto and I believe we would gain nothing from including it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 is a bit of a hybrid—if I may use that word in a non-parliamentary sense—because subsection(l), as I understand it, is the sort of preliminary clause that the Renton report recommended, though that report may have been wrong in its recommendations. Innumerable committees have made foolish recom-
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
mendations to the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objective was to produce a clause 1(1). But in clause 1 as a whole we have a lot of other matters in subsections (2), (3) and (4) which are not the sort of items which the Renton committee recommended should be included in a preliminary or explanatory clause. I am unhappy about its technical content, and in particular, about those items that are deliberately omitted from subsection (1). I am not sure whether the operators and judges need guidance on seven aspects of part I, but I cannot understand why they do not ned some guidance at the beginning of the Bill on the purposes of those aspects included in part I, but not covered in clause 1. Therefore the clause seems to be inadequate from that point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to what has been referred to as the mini Second Reading debate. I shall not go through all the topics that have been raised or may be raised later. I shall try to confine myself to replying to the points made by the Parliamentary Secretary. I understood him to say that the basic fundamental change was the change in clause 5 to create a presumption in favour of applicants in the granting of licences by traffic commissioners. I think that it is fair to say that the effects of that change may be grossly exaggerated by both sides of the Committee for their own ends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that, as so few operators have applied to introduce rural services and even fewer have been turned down, the positive impact of that aspect of the Bill on rural areas will be negligible. However, other aspects of the Bill particularly those that will make it difficult for bus companies, whether privately or publicly owned, to subsidise non-paying services —will have a negative effect. They will destroy the substantial number of rural services which the Minister claims will be supported by the change in the presumption in favour of the operator who applies to provide a service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point should be borne in mind. It will also be easier for those operating rural services to withdraw from the services they provide at present. Conservative members of the Committee who represent rural areas should take cognisance of that fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

for giving way. He may recall that on Second Reading the hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Neale) made a very strong claim that in Cornwall the bus service was run by the private services and that that arrangement had advantages which we should consider. I have taken the opportunity to look at the Cornwall transport plan, which makes clear that, as the hon. Gentleman said, the majority of services are provided by private operators, but the buses make only very infrequent runs. They do not run every day. The county council refers to the far less frequent services provided by the independent operators—some working only five days, some working only in school terms and some hardly working at all. The hon. Gentleman misrepresented the case in a totally misleading fashion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One would have hoped, Mr. English, that the selection of hon. Gentlemen to sit on the Conservative Benches might have been on the basis of a close knowledge of the transport industry, but it appears that they have been selected on the basis of having taken Trappist vows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary dealt next with the question of fares. He referred to clause 7 of the Bill, which is referred to in clause 1. Clause 1(1) (
	<i>c</i>) states that one of the purposes of part I of the Bill is to restrict the powers of the traffic commissioners to attach conditions as to fares. The Parliamentary Secretary made the somewhat peculiar statement that members of the general public would not expect any consequences to flow from that chonge. I think that, under both the last Government and, more particularly, the present one, the general public has quickly learnt that when restrictions on prices—and that is what fares are—are removed, the immediate consequence is that prices rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary may say that people in the country have not noticed the consequences of the restriction of fares by the traffic commissioners, but I should like to refer him to the Trinidadian calypso of which the refrain is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You never miss de water until de well runs dry".</p></blockquote>
I suspect that many people will not miss the control of fares by the traffic commissioners until the fares escalate. The principle is the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fares are going up now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I entirely agree. Fares are going up now, but there is some restraint on those fares by the traffic commissioners. If there is not that element of restraint, why do the Government propose to remove it? Is it a totally useless legislative change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member will know that fares control works in both directions. Some operators would like to see fares control retained. Their motive is usually that the commissioners can stop others from offering cheaper fares than are available at the time. Many advocates of fares control are anxious that it should be used to keep up the level of fares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that, as bus operators tend to operate systems rather than single routes, it would be to the advantage of the totality of bus users in a specfic area if some fares were kept slightly higher than would be justified on the basis of the single paying route. Unless that is done, there will be no surplus to cross-subsidise the routes that lose money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the whole basis of the Opposition's objection to the Bill's proposals. We recognise, as the Government do not, that cross-subsidisation of non-paying routes is a vital element in maintaining even the present rather weak network of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his press statements before the Bill was introduced, and on Second Reading, the Minister of Transport laid great emphasis on the increased opportunities for car sharing, which is also covered in clause 1. Before waxing so enthusiastic about the car-sharing concept, the Minister might have taken the trouble to read the recent report from his Transport and Road Research Laboratory, entitled "Car Sharing and Car Pooling in Great Britain: the recent situation and potential". The right hon. Gentleman referred on Second Reading to all the gains that would result from a higher occupancy of cars coming into big cities. The report from those who have examined the matter in detail states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a 10 per cent. increase in car occupancy can be achieved only if the perceived cost of motoring doubles."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister of Transport know some-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
thing that we do not. However, dramatic claims about increases in car occupancy are rather undermined by that technical document produced by their Department. That is something else which they should bear in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 also refers to the trial areas—the free-fire areas or no-go zones for the traffic commissioners. We shall be making many detailed objections to those proposals. However, there is a vital point that should be mentioned at this stage. It is proposed that once introduced the trial areas must remain for three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of County Councils and other bodies are responsible for transport in a way that the Ministry of Transport, of course, never is. As with many other Whitehall Departments, the Ministry is always at one remove from actually providing the public with any services. Representations have already been made by those bodies that it would be preposterous to introduce trial areas for three years without being able to determine that they had failed during that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present the Bill could ensure not only that chaos may reign in a trial area, but that if it does it will reign for three years. That does not seem a sound way of proceeding. Therefore I object to the proposal for trial areas, because I believe that they are absurd. If they fail, they will have a protracted ill effect on an area's transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I object to that part of clause 1 introduced by my right hon. Friend's excellent amendment which was accepted by the Government. The amendment was excellent because as it showed that the Government had left out what they claimed as an important change in the London area, but without saying anything that might cause you, Mr. English, to curtail debate on the London aspect at a later stage, I have to say that when we already have about five different public bodies responsible, in one way or another, for making a mess of London Transport, the addition of a sixth is absurd and will undoubtedly damage the transport provision in the London area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is just as daft and irrelevant as most of the other proposals listed in clause 1, and those in part I that the Minister's advisers have not managed to pull together to within clause 1, either because the Bill was so hurried that they did not have time or because part I is so compli-
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
cated that they cannot discern the major principles which should have been drawn out in the preliminary report, as recommended by the Renton committee. Of course, it may be that because of the manpower cuts in the Ministry, they did not have the resources to do the job properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, on grounds of its technical content and the general stupidity of the transport policy outlined in it, I shall not support the proposition that the clause stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank right hon. and hon. Gentlemen for their obvious pre-agreement with what I am about to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has greatly disturbed me to find from the discussions during the four sittings of the Committee that what was proposed by my right hon. Friend as a far-reaching discussion on the philosophy of the detail of the Bill, which clause 1 has offered, has been so totally ignored. It is tragic that Labour Members have demonstrated far more interest in procedural matters than in the changes in the Bill. I understand their need to demonstrate their muscular ability, but it seems a great pity that they have shown so much bicep and so little intellect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill offers hopes for change and innovation, and I hoped that we would have an opportunity for assessing the Opposition's overall philosophy so that we could see whether there was any common ground and, when we came to the detail, we would already have been aware of some of their thoughts and views and whether we could agree with them. It is tragic that after four meetings I am still almost totally unaware, except for some of the comments made by hon. Gentlemen, of their detailed views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that the past has not brought success, that the status quo is not successful and that the outline philosophy in clause 1 accepts that and puts forward the need for change. If we could say that public control has worked over the past three years in rural constituencies such as mine, that bus services were either satisfactory or declining at only a slow rate, perhaps there would be no need for the Bill. But, tragically, the opposite is true. During the years of public control we have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
seen fares going up unacceptably and services going down unacceptably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members must surely recognise that there is a need for change and that every minute of the Committee is precious so that discussion of the real and substantive need for change can ensue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I tell hon. the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) who mentioned the difficulty of the chap standing by the bus stop in East Anglia that I feel sure that the same man, standing by the bus stop in Meriden village, would be paralysed if I explained to him that the present system of traffic commissioners is set up to allow the public utilities, the transport exectives of the National Bus Company, to have an unfair bias.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I have been slightly controversial, but, I hope hon. Gentlemen will forgive me because I speak with sincere feeling. However, having indicated some of the need I make a plea that from now on we should look at the real issues involved in the Bill, as the clause 1 stand part debate will allow us to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to respond in the spirit in which the argument was advanced by the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills). It is clear that we have spent more time on procedural matters than we ought to have done, but many of my hon. Friends were faced with difficulties when rulings were made at the beginning about the nature of clause 1 and whether it was amendable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me briefly approach some matters of principle to which the hon. Member for Meriden referred. Now that we are debating clause 1 stand part we can come to arguments of substance about transport matters, because the debate gives us an opportunity to argue in principle and to pass judgment on the selection of measures, and package of purposes put forward in clause 1. I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary intends to make a further response, but we should like to hear from him after the matters of principle have been outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall look at clause 1 in terms of what it is trying to do on transport principle, and perhaps analyse some of the assumptions on which the clause is based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, clause 1 outlines a re-classification of public service vehicles. It abolishes road service licences for express carriages under a new definition of such services. It
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
makes it easier to obtain road service licences and restricts the powers in certain respects of traffic commissioners to attach conditions to fares. Later clauses designate trial areas and make changes with regard to the fitness of public service vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit that the Bill is not a move to unregulated competition, but it is a step along the way. In the trial areas that are proposed, where free market conditions will prevail, it is hoped that some eternal truths will emerge which will be of general application in principle elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1, with its list of purposes, is an argument in principle about where to draw the line between regulation and competition. It is an argument about the public interest and the best way to serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Broadly speaking, there are two approaches. First, a move towards competition and change, and secondly the retention of a more structured system of regulation which can broadly be described as the status quo.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first assumption on which the clause is based is that regulation in the form of licensing regulation is a major factor in the overall efficiency and framework of services. It is argued that licensing has been of such moment in transport history that altering it will mean a change for the better. I do not think so, because licensing has been the small change of the transport argument and is not a substantial factor. There are more fundamental factors that have led to a decline in bus services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the State has assumed a substantial regulatory role. Traffic commissioners, too, have powers of regulation. But it is the principle of the Bill that I attack—and this principle was outlined by the Minister on Second Reading, when I listened carefully to what he said. He said that the conditions in the 1920s, when transport in rural areas was expanding in the most unregulated way, meant that there was a need for the regulation in the 1930 Act. But surely regulation is even more relevant when the industry is in decline than when it is expanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we examine other industries and public utilities, it is in a market condition of decline that most of the attempts from both sides of the political fence have come over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bus licensing system was set up to protect the public and the industry itself from the chaos that existed previously. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
was intended as an aid to regular services and to guarantee them and provide a measure of stability. If those objectives were desirable at a time of rapid growth and expansion in public transport, they are essential at a time of contraction. That is the point of principle on which I attack clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other factors. There is to be a presumption in favour of the new operator over others who wish to compete. Underlying that, there is an economic principle. Ultimately, it will mean that the fare structure will be more specifically related to cost. The other side of that coin is that the principle of cross-subsidisation which has occurred in many services is in some way a misallocation of resources in strictly economic terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objectives of the 1930 Act, on which all this argument is based, were to eliminate wasteful competition and to facilitate the provision of unremunerative services. There was considerable confusion in that too. If we are to promote efficient services we cannot at the same time promote unremunerative services, because the two do not fit together in economic principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard the Minister say in his television broadcast that there will be an improvement because small operators, who have more flexibility, will make decisions for themselves and that they will have more transport elbow room. They will have a cost structure that will enable them to come on to certain routes—he did not quite say routes where there are no services at present—and suggested that the lower structure of those flexible operators would enable them to come into the transport system to the benefit of the consumer and that they would make a substantial difference to the framework of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My contention is that when the operator comes into the market to compete with the new service, he will attack those profitable services. The fact that new operators may have more flexible and lower cost structures in some cases leads to my second point, which is that their services will be even more profitable than the existing, already profitable services. The small operator will attack existing services and will not provide any element of cross-subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been argued that the principle of cross-subsidisation has declined over the years. How far it has declined we do not
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
know. My research has not revealed how great a part cross-subsidisation now plays. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could tell us. The small operator will make even greater profits if he attacks the best routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we go further with that argument, we should examine the nature of competition in the bus industry. What is it? How does it operate? How does it affect costs? Two fundamental factors have caused the decline of the bus industry. First, there is competition from the private motor car, with the increase in people's disposable income over the years. That has been the major cause. Secondly, there have been changes in society itself, because we have concentrated the services of society. Cottage hospitals have disappeared. Retail services have been concentrated. The DHSS has concentrated its services. We have comprehensive schools in rural areas. All those factors have put burdens on public transport, which is not as flexible as the motor car. Here we come to the real core of principle. It is not licensing that has caused the problems, but the fundamental structural factors to which licensing has not much relevance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, there has never been much profit in stage carriage services. An operator in East Anglia told me that the only man who ever made money from carriage services was Dick Turpin. He was an entrepreneur of sorts. It indicates that in the bus industry there is competition of any intensity only in a particular sector, and that is contract hire, which is tailored to the needs of a group. There is a good chance of a high load factor, revenue guaranteed in advance of the contract and consumer satisfaction, in that consumers can start off with a few crates of light ale and a song. That appeals to passengers no end. So stage carriage services are quite a different proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last argument relates to the whole argument against competition itself. Competitors are to come into the public utility. If competition is to get anywhere, someone will be hurt. That is what competition is about. Competition is a fight, and it is a fight on a cost basis. Very often, if the most efficient is to prevail, there will be a fight to the finish. It will mean falling revenues for existing services and, perhaps, bankruptcies. In fact, the avoidance of bankruptcy is put forward as a reason for efficiency in terms of cost in a com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
petitive system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The irony is that as soon as competition starts to hurt, the people competing with one another start to carve up the market between them. I have never yet known any competitors continue to hurt one another without getting together and saying, "Let us have a bit of common sense. Let us regulate the situation." New competitors will come in, but they make up their minds to be troublesome only up to the point at which they get a share of the action. Then they reach a cosy agreement with the status quo. So at the end of the day there will be the same regulated framework. The operators will be different, but the principles will be the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look at transport questions in a pragmatic way. There are arguments for more flexibility and initiative and response to the changing needs of the consumer. But the basic framework of regulation must remain largely as it is, with its established services. The Bill, and clause 1 in particular, have more to do with dogma than with practical transport reality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great interest to the contribution of the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills). I welcome what he said, not because I agree with it, but because at least he gave an indication of why he has been supporting the Minister of Transport and the Parliamentary Secretary throughout our four sittings. Apparently, he has accepted his right hon. Friend's argument that it would be better for the Committee to debate the philosophy of clause 1—or even the philosophy of the first part of the Bill, in so far as it was listed or defined in clause 1—than to have such a difficult and bitter argument about how we should proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that, in the course of the Committee, I or my hon. Friends will persuade the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) to change his philosophy. But I hope that we shall be able to persuade him that when hon. Members seek to defend a right to change the wording of legislation and dissent from a proposition by the Executive on the law of this country, they are not trifling with unimportant matters. They are dealing with something that is very serious and fundamental to the democratic process of the country, which has been fought for, for a long time. Grave damage will be done to our dem-
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
ocratic process on the day that any hon. Member—including the hon. Member for Meriden—is prepared to exchange that right for the right to discuss philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary has, at this late stage, done something that the Minister was not prepared to do. He has indicated where the precedent lies for the clause. Had the Minister done that in our first sitting we may have been able to persuade him that there was another way of avoiding the difficulty. I am delighted to learn that the guide used by the Government in drafting clause 1 was section 1 of the Health and Safety at Work, etc., Act. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will read other Labour legislation and pick up more good ideas. The trouble is that he has not read that section carefully and has not examined the way in which it was debated. He has not even taken the trouble to find out which Minister was in charge of the Bill. I hope that, unlike his right hon. Friend, he will be good enough to withdraw what he said. I was not the Minister in charge. My right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) was in charge and my right hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Foot) was the Secretary of State for Employment. I was in charge of regulations made under the Bill when I became Secretary of State. So the Parliamentary Secretary was wrong in that just as his right hon. Friend was wrong in saying that when I was a member of the Cabinet I was paired so that I did not have to attend every sitting of Standing Committees. Let us put the record straight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further reason why I am glad that the Government are to be guided in the way in which they frame Bills, by reference to that section 1 of that Act. The section is about purposes. One reason that I am advocating that the clause does not stand part of the Bill, in spite of our attempts to amend and improve it, is that it fails accurately to define purposes and it fails to meet the Parliamentary Secretary's test. I listened with interest, as did the Committee, to the first occasion on which a Minister defined the Government's test of what was appropriate for a first clause such as this. He said that the clause should be an accurate description of the contents of the first part of the Bill, and it should guide and help the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If clause 1 did those things, there would be a good case for including it in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, apply the Minister's test to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
the clause. Does it cover the major purposes? Does it define accurately what is in part I? And does it guide the courts? I put it to him that it certainly fails miserably to guide the courts. It was noticeable that the Minister himself, sensing the weakness of the ground when he reached that point, immediately and very wisely turned to the only part of the clause which does guide the courts, namely subsection (1) (
	<i>c</i>),
	<br><blockquote><p>"making it easier for applicants to obtain road service licences".</p></blockquote>
That certainly gives very clear guidance to the courts. One can imagine the difficulty that it will cause when people begin to protest that they have not found it easier to get licences in certain places. But certainly that will be of guidance to the courts. If a person can show in litigation that the way in which the Bill has been operated has in some way made that harder than under the existing legislation, he will have a very good case. He will probably be able to persuade the court that whoever administered it was wrong, and his appeal may well be upheld.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine the other provisions of subsection (1). First, there is paragraph (
	<i>a)</i>),
	<br><blockquote><p>"redefining and reclassifying public service vehicles".</p></blockquote>
How can that possibly help the courts in deciding whether they have been reclassified correctly or not? Then there is paragraph (
	<i>b</i>),
	<br><blockquote><p>"abolishing road service licences for express carriages as redefined".</p></blockquote>
That is no help whatever. It gives not the slightest shred of assistance to the courts. Paragraph (
	<i>d</i>),
	<br><blockquote><p>"providing for the designation of areas as trial areas"</p></blockquote>
does not help the courts either. Nor does paragraph (
	<i>e</i>),
	<br><blockquote><p>"making new provision for securing the fitness of public service vehicles",</p></blockquote>
or paragraph (
	<i>f</i>),
	<br><blockquote><p>"substituting a system of public service vehicle operators' licences…".</p></blockquote>
None of those are of any help to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
My first criticism of the clause, therefore, and my first argument for its being left out of the Bill even at this stage, is that it does not do what the Parliamentary Secretary has said that it should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not to say that our debates on the clause have not been helpful. They have exposed a number of matters which will be of help to members of the Committee. They have exposed the fact that the Government have not, in their clear and open mind, any precise idea as to what different criteria should apply in London as compared with other places when there is an appeal against the existing network system. We know that the Government will now be open to argument as to what form of appeal that should be. That is a matter of great interest to the London Transport Executive, and one which might usefully have been indicated when the discussion document on the Bill was published. It was not indicated then, but it has been indicated now, as a result of our attempts to amend clause 1 in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has also been a useful exercise in that it has indicated that the Government will be extremely reluctant to give certain types of information that the Committee will want. Members will therefore have to use other resources in order to secure it. In the absence of that guidance, we shall have to find other ways of raising the very important matters which flow from the philosophy, aims and purposes of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have made it clear on Second Reading and again today that one of the intentions or purposes is that people who have so far been unable to find their way into network operation should now be able to do so. That is a very important purpose, and we shall wish to debate it. But no attempt has been made to refute what was said on Second Reading, namely, that they will be seeking to come into the profitable elements of existing networks. There is no suggestion that they will be coming in to lift from existing operators the burden of running unprofitable routes. They will come into profitable networks, in such a way that the cross-subsidised network service will no longer be able to operate as it does today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a matter which must concern the Committee. It must affect the way in which the Government operate the transport support grant in England and Wales, and the way in which the rate support grant is operated in Scotland. We have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0107">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
had no indication of how the Government are to deal with that. We do not know how they are to change their policy, or whether they are to increase the transport support grant in England and Wales, and the rate support grant in Scotland, to pick up the support for the unprofitable services which will no longer be supported on the cross-subsidy principle as a result of new operators on the most profitable routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had also hoped that what might have come out of our debate, and what might have been defined when the Minister had had a chance to reconsider, was this massive extension to the scope for contract carriage operation. There is no indication of that. It was denied on Second Reading but now, I hope, accepted as being a correct assertion by the Opposition. The Bill, if unamended, would massively extend the scope of contract carriage operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, and I hope this within the broad policy and purposes of the Bill, if not totally within the philosophy, I refer to the connection between this legislation and what is happening in the European Economic Community. The EEC is indicating very clearly the extent to which, in a few years time, regulations or law will be operating through out the Community in this important area. To his credit the Minister made that aspect very clear in the discussion document he circulated. He pointed out that in a few years time there will be an EEC view on the extent to which operator licensing should be the means by which we in the EEC determine the safeguards for our people using public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also indicated in his discussion document that we could shortly anticipate that the EEC would have a view and would issue regulations which would apply throughout the Community affecting the safety of public service vehicles. Therefore I had hoped that in any discussion on purposes we would have had a clear indication from Government of how they propose to link the legislation proposed in this Bill with what might become the overlying requirements of the Community, or at least how they could be harmonised and matched to our law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are some of the important issues which I believe are within the philosophy and purposes of the Bill. I regret that the Minister did not follow the example which he chose from the Health and Safety at
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
Work, etc. Act, and stated the purposes in the way they were stated there. I regret that much of the debate on the clause has been an acrimonious battle, an argument, on how the House could carry out its traditional role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, we are coming to the Christmas period and on behalf of my hon. Friends I should like to make a gesture which I hope will assist future proceedings. We feel that we cannot much better the clause now. We want to proceed in a different spirit on subsequent clauses. I hope, therefore, that we shall not go into a long philosophical dissertation on both sides, as we could easily do, about purposes in the light of previous difficulties. We can, if necessary, record our differences on whether the clause stands part of the Bill when the Minister has responded to the matters raised by both sides, and enter the New Year in the spirit of seeking to carry out the traditional role of a standing Committee. I am suggesting not that we should abandon real and genuinely held differences, but that we should seek to discuss them constructively and facilitate one another in giving a proper majority expression to the judgments of members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first follow up that welcome last point. Certainly I shall try to enter into the spirit of Christmas. I shall answer the debate to enable us to come to our conclusions fairly quickly and hope to return in the New Year to join in full and proper debate on the remainder of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not interpret the speech of my hon. Friend the Minister for Meriden (Mr. Mills) as an attack on our parliamentary rights. It seems unfortunate that we have spent a great deal of our time on procedure and moved at a rather late stage to the content and purposes of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore I shall not labour further the argument about the whole style of clause 1. Clearly there is disagreement between us. I withdraw my suggestion that the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) was in charge of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act. He was a Minister in that Department at the time, but obviously with other responsibilities. Nevertheless, it remains a precedent for what we are doing and if the right hon. Member reads it I think that he will find that its style and content are not dissimilar to those in the Bill. Indeed, although the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0108">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
right hon. Gentleman claimed that he had difficulties with clause 1(3) there is a subsection in the Act which has to be read many times before meaning can be extracted from it. We also have the president of the Renton committee and I still insist that this is a useful way of beginning this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill begins to open up our discussions on the purposes of the legislation. The hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) put forward a number of his doubts about what has been said in debates in the House and on other occasions about where we are going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In talking about innovation as I did when I opened the debate, it is true that we have in mind small operators. We think that more small operators, perhaps those who at the moment are confined to coach and excursion business, may move into the stage carriage business and provide a more flexible and lower cost service in those rural parts of the country where services are inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small operators can have many advantages. Because they are closer to the loyalty they tend to have lower overhead charges than large national or regional operators. It tends to be much easier for a smalll operator, who personally manages his business, to adjust his timetable to the needs of a small local community. We believe that small operators will take advantage of the new criteria for licensing and come forward to provide some variety in services or improve services which are lacking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition argument—no doubt we shall return to it in more detail later—is that any new operator will largely be going for profitable services, damaging the network and damaging the cross-subsidisation upon which the present public transport system depends. As we have made clear, we believe that it is a wholly exaggerated argument. But I personally and the Government, accept that there is a place for some cross-subsidisation in passenger transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give an obvious example. It can easily be demonstrated that passengers at busy times of the day are subsidising the fares of passengers at other less heavily patronised times. It appears to us wrong that there should be any presumption that the present pattern of cross-subsidiation has
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
to be retained. What has developed over the years, because of the restrictive system of licensing, fares control and so on, is that long-standing patterns of cross subsidisation are maintained. Sometimes the choice that has been made between passengers in one locality who are paying more for their fares than they otherwise should, in order to keep fares down for passengers in another locality, is not a matter of sensible economic or deliberate choice. The system of licensing has tended to freeze the pattern of cross-subsidisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other part of the argument is the question of whether all new applicants would go for the profitable services. The questions begged by that argument are: what is profitable, what sort of service and to whom is it supplied? As I said on Second Reading, some of the most unprofitable services in the country are some of the busiest and most heavily patronised services in our big cities. Whether a particular service in a surburban or rural area is profitable depends on the size of the vehicle provided, the overheads of the operator, the way in which he arranges his manning and, whether his timetable accurately reflects local travelling needs. A badly organised operator with heavy overheads can make a loss on a service out of which a better organised and more suitable operator could make a profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not have any change in the present system because the licensing authorities, bound as they are by past practice and legislation, will exclude the new applicant, leaving the unprofitable existing applicant to look to the local authority for subsidy and to have his services protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at the start of this debate, those are some of the considerations in our minds in seeking to change the atmosphere, to change the criteria and to encourage innovation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that there is one change in contract carriage. I shall not argue again with the right hon. Gentleman whether it is extensive. The one change of significance is that contract carriage arrangements will now be permissible for regular services—the school bus, the works bus. The others are unimportant. It means that there will be less obstruction than there has been in the past. That may be significant at a time when school transport arrangements are being changed. There may be fewer difficulties for parent-

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that. If parents in rural areas wish to organise for themselves a contract carriage arrangement, I do not see what is wrong with that. I do not hold that up as a general dream or vision for what is to happen in all rural areas. But it is a small, though significant, example of what might happen as a result of the small change made in the contract carriage arrangements in the Bill. No doubt we shall debate the matter again when we come to the contract carriage clauses of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As certain bus depots have closed when companies have lost existing contracts to provide school bus services, his proposition that parent-teacher associations will have to take over will be a major factor in rural areas as a result of the halving of the subsidy to school buses in the Education (No. 2) Bill now going through the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that. Parent-teacher associations will not actually run the buses under contract carriage arrangements. I envisage that the association will be able to approach a coach operator and enter into a contract with him for a regular service for their children. The operator himself will need to have an operator's licence, be a regular person and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of the operator licensing and the safety system, the Bill's provisions are compatible with the EEC roadworthiness directive, to which the right hon. Gentleman referred and with which we intend to comply. The system of operating licences is set out in the clause. We also envisage going over to the annual inspection of vehicles in compliance with the EEC directive. However, the Bill provides for transitional arrangements before
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
that comes into effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say whether it is the Government's intention to retain in other legislation the need for annual inspection until such time as the EEC regulation becomes effective? In this Bill there seems to be no reference to retaining the annual inspection requirement on the public service vehicle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no annual inspection requirement under the law at the moment, but in practice inspectors go round and make sure that the PSV licensing arrangements are being complied with. In broad terms, the Bill will ensure that the present arrangements are kept in being until we go over to the annual inspections that the EEC roadworthiness directive requires. We shall come to that matter later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that there is a distinction between the passenger service vehicle and the freight vehicle, for which there is the annual test requirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is just so. In the case of freight vehicles there is the whole stystem of heavy goods vehicle testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we comply with the new directive, the position relating to passenger vehicles will be similar to that which exists at present for heavy goods vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the key point that illustrates the difference between us is the whole question of trial areas which was raised by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson). Certainly we are contemplating trials with no quantity licensing for buses. We put that forward in the belief that it will be demonstrated in some areas that a system of quantity licensing is serving no purpose that the system could be withdrawn and it would be discovered that the emperor has no clothes and has not had any clothes for quite a long time. The Bill is cautious. This will happen only where counties actually apply to become trial areas. There are 10 or 12 counties that appear to be actively interested in becoming trial areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a minimum period of three years. The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South queried that. The reason for the three-year requirement is that no one will move into a trial area if there is a risk that arrangements might
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
be changed over night. There needs to be a period for people to react to having trial areas and to know where they stand. If the areas could be withdrawn in less than three years no change would take place because clearly no investment would be justifiable if we could revert quickly to the present situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of trial areas will no doubt lead to a genuine philosophical debate and will underline the clear differences between us. We are deregulating and relaxing a system of licensing. That will never appeal to the Labour Party. The very word "licensing" is music in the ears</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question accordingly agreed to Clause 1 as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. It may be that there are those among us who are dying to get onto the next clause, which deals with tram cars, but many of us are thinking of Christmas and other things. In light of what the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness said earlier, this might be a suitable moment to adjourn. May I wish a merry Christmas to you, Mr. English and to all members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>of most Labour Members. The idea that a tightly regulated system of Government involvement of 49 years' standing should be changed or relaxed is anathema to any true Socialist. But it is our belief that the system has gone on for far too long. Licensing is not an object in itself; it should serve the public, and our licensing system in this area needs to be relaxed as soon as possible.</p>
