	<p>
	<b>1 Equal opportunities for carers</b>

	<ol>

	<li>A local authority shall in carrying out its social services functions have due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity between carers and persons without caring responsibilities with regard to carers' health and well-being.</li>

	<li>In pursuance of subsection (1) it shall be the duty of every local authority, when providing or securing the provision of services, to have due regard to providing and securing services which they consider likely to encourage, enable or assist (directly or indirectly) effective participation by carers in education, training, employment and leisure opportunities.</li>

	<li>Regulations may be made in relation to subsections (1) and (2) which provide for—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>any programmes that need to be developed to secure the effective promotion of equality of opportunity, and</li>

	<li>the services which may encourage or promote the health and wellbeing of carers.</li>
</ol></ol></p>

	<p>
	<b>Planning for provision of information for carers</b>

	<ol>

	<li>It shall be the duty of local authorities, in co-operation with National Health Service (NHS) bodies, to ensure that the community strategies that they prepare for the purposes of section 4 of the Local Government Act 2000 (c. 22) make specific provision for informing relevant carers of the services that the local authority provides which are likely to promote the carers' health and well-being.</li>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2003-2004C003P0I0004">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>

	<li>For the purposes of this section, a relevant carer is a carer who appears to the local authority to be a person who may have rights under section 1 or section 6 of the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000 (c. 16) (the 2000 Act).</li>

	<p>
	<b>3 Duty to inform</b>

	<ol>

	<li>Where it appears to a local authority both that—

	<ol>

	<li>a person aged 18 or over ("the adult cared for") is a person for whom it may provide or arrange for the provision of community care services, or</li>

	<li>a disabled child ("the child cared for") and his family are persons for whom it may provide or arrange for the provision of services under section 17 of the Children Act 1989 (c. 41) or section 2 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 (c. 44); and</li>

	<li>another person ("the carer") provides, or intends to provide, a substantial amount of care on a regular basis for the person cared for,</li></ol>
the local authority shall notify the carer that he may be entitled under section 1 or section 6 of the 2000 Act and section 1 of the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995 (c. 12) to request an assessment of his ability to provide, or 20 continue to provide, care for the adult or child cared for.</li></ol></p>

	<p>
	<b>4 Co-operation between authorities</b>

	<ol>

	<li> Where it appears to a local authority that any authority mentioned in subsection (3) could, by taking any specified action, help in the exercise of any of their functions under this Act, they may request the help of that other authority, specifying the action in question.</li>

	<li>An authority whose help is so requested shall comply with the request if it is compatible with their own statutory or other duties and obligations and does not unduly prejudice the discharge of any of their functions.</li>

	<li>The authorities are—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>any local authority;</li>

	<li>any local education authority;</li>

	<li>any local housing authority;</li>
