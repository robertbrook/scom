	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my memory serves me correctly, at 1 o'clock I interrupted the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith), who was quoting from a letter from a Mr. D. of Shropshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Refreshed by lunch and even more refreshed by Prime Minister's Questions this afternoon, I am sure that the Committee will be pleased to have the benefit of the rest of Mr. D.'s letter. As the Committee will recall, Mr. D. of Shropshire had written to the Prime Minister to protest about a letter that he had received from the Inland Revenue. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"why have you allowed Mr. Clarke to begin to destroy family values by increasing this tax in such a despicable fashion?</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I am a lifelong Conservative. I worked hard in my early twenties in the mid fifties for the party as Young Conservative. My wife and I are also saddened that our excellent MP Mr. John Biffen is retiring at the next election. That does leave us to ponder seriously whether to support the Labour party at that time.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I realise, Sir, that you are a busy decent family man working hard to lead our Government at this time, but my conscience and peace of mind will not rest until I have made known to you my complaint regarding this outrageous treatment meted out by Mr. Clarke to a happily married couple and many more like us."</p></blockquote>
There are many more like them, including Mr. R. of York, who wrote to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition. Mr. R. of York said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although your campaign to prevent the imposition of the second phase of VAT on domestic fuel was a success might I suggest that a much more valid target for attack should have been the gradual phasing out of the Married Allowance, a phasing out which will ultimately prove far more costly to the taxpayer than the 17.5 per cent. VAT on fuel costs.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>This allowance was, as I am sure you will remember, guaranteed to remain in force by Mrs. Thatcher, Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson despite the introduction of independent taxation for married women.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Indeed a report from the Institute of Economic Affairs entitled 'Farewell to the Family', prepared by Patricia Morgan, accuses Ministers in the present Government of pursuing an anti-marriage policy vis-a-vis the tax and welfare systems.—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Please may we have one person addressing the Committee, not conversations between hon. Members. Courtesy to the Chair, please.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Winterton. It will do Conservative Members good to listen to what Mr. R. of York has to say. This is especially relevant to my
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
argument about how such policies impact on the income tax that people pay. He explains:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On a personal level my notice of coding for the current financial year shows a married allowance of £2,705, i.e. the allowance for the 75-plus group. This would have meant, at 25 per cent., a reduction in my tax bill of £676.25. However, there was an allowance restriction of £541 resulting in a net increase in tax of £135.25. For the next financial year, 1995–96, the Chancellor has operated on the apparently-more-meaning-considerably-less principle."</p></blockquote>
That is a fitting phrase, which could be applied to Budgets proposed by the Conservative Government. Mr. R. continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"By that I mean he has increased the allowance to £3,035 for the 75-plus group but reduced the relief to 15 per cent. i.e. £455.25 or £221 less than it would have been had he retained the allowance of £2,705 at 25 per cent.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The increased taxation on the above basis is £356.25 in two years—far more, I am sure you will agree than I would expect to pay in VAT on fuel. Should the Chancellor have his way and abolish completely the Married Allowance it will ultimately mean, based on the figures I have used, an increase of £13 per week in income tax for all couples in our situation."</p></blockquote>
He means people in the 75-plus age group. We can understand what a serious burden the changes are imposing through the increased actual income tax that people are having to pay. That example shows that, while the clause and the Chancellor's honeyed words in the Budget appear to safeguard the interests of the likes of Mr. D. of Shropshire and Mr. R. of York and their families, the reality is very different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality is also different for the typical family to whom I referred when I started my speech before lunch. Once they have recovered from the Chancellor's generosity in giving them £5 a year off their income tax by increasing the 20 per cent, band, they will be hit by the realisation that the same Chancellor, is, with the other hand, taking an extra £96 a year by freezing the married couple's allowance and restricting it to 15 per cent. That increase comes on top of the £96 increase that the Chancellor took last April by freezing the allowance and restricting it to 20 per cent. Of course, that is not the end of the Tory income tax increases that people face. On top of them all comes the cut in mortgage tax relief to 15 per cent. I quote—more briefly this time—from a letter written to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition by Mr. G. of Doncaster:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The second point of concern"—</p></blockquote>
it is the second of a list of several points of concern that he has with the Government's policies—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is that of the loss of tax relief on my mortgage interest payments, there are nine other people very interested in your answer. Many of us, the small people, swallowed the Conservative Ideology of owning our own homes. I bought my house as prices were falling and now it is worth less than I paid for it. The tax relief has made all the difference to my existence and to that of a great many other people in similar positions."</p></blockquote>
Many people in our country have negative equity and are just hanging on. They can ill afford the hammer blows that rain down on them as mortgage and tax relief is cut. The typical family will suffer an increase of approximately £128.10 a year in its mortgage repayments. That means an extra £128.10 on its tax, resulting directly from the Chancellor's policies. Again, that is in addition to the similar amount it faced last year when the Chancellor decided to cut mortgage tax relief to 20 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impact of the latest cut in mortgage tax relief will be all the more serious for those affected and, therefore,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
ultimately for Conservative Members, because it happens at the same time as the Chancellor is banging up interest rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The income tax increases come in addition to all the increases in indirect taxation that the Government have forced through, including the increase in insurance premium tax, which we debated earlier. They amount to an additional burden that the Chancellor conceded to the Treasury Select Committee was equivalent to 7p in the pound on the basic rate of tax. When all those Tory high-tax Budgets are taken into account, those increases add up to £805.31 more being imposed on a typical family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party and the British people believe that all of those increases have blown apart any Conservative claim to be a low-tax party and the statistics bear that out. In 1978–79 total tax as a proportion of GDP stood at 34.3 per cent. In 1995–96 the ratio will be 37 per cent. In 1978–79, 32.2 per cent, of the gross income of a family with an average income went in direct and indirect tax. This year that figure will rise to 38.2 per cent. In 1978–79 income tax and national insurance took 26.4 per cent, of a typical family's gross income. From April that figure will be 27.4 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whichever way we look at it, people are facing a heavier tax burden as a consequence of 16 years of a Conservative Government. That tax burden has not just become heavier, it has become more and more unfair as its relative burden has shifted from the richest in society to middle and lower-income Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comparison between the richest fifth and the poorest fifth of the population is revealing. In 1979 the poorest fifth paid 31 per cent, of their gross income in tax and the richest fifth paid 38 per cent. By 1992, the most recent year for which I have the figures, the poorest fifth paid 39 per cent, of their income in tax and the richest fifth paid just 34 per cent. That is a total inversion of the progressive principle in taxation which used to command agreement across the political spectrum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For completeness, would the hon. Gentleman like to put on the record the fact that the poorest tenth of taxpayers are now contributing a larger proportion according to the latest available figures—I believe that they cover 1992–93—when compared with 1979?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the poorest taxpayers are contributing a larger percentage. He seems to be agreeing with my argument—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<i>rose</i>—</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a minute and perhaps the hon. Gentleman will respond to the following quotation from his election manifesto in which he stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The burden of income tax has been reduced and only the Conservatives promise further reductions when circumstances permit."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will tell the Committee why, since he made that promise, the typical family is facing heavier and heavier taxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Winterton, if I said the poorest 10 per cent, in my earlier intervention; I meant to say the richest 10 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
If the hon. Gentleman looks at the figures, he will see that what I said is true—that is, that the richest 10 per cent, of taxpayers contributed a larger proportion in 1992, which is the latest year for which full figures are available, than in 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stated in my election address, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, "when circumstances permit". I am very glad to say that the Chancellor has acted prudently and has given top priority in recent years to closing the public sector deficit. That must be right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That provokes the question of why the public sector deficit became so high in the first place. We shall take no lectures in fiscal prudence from a Government who, in the next five years, will spend £36 billion more in interest on the national debt than in the past five years. The Government have been marked by economic incompetence, equalled only by their fiscal irresponsibility. The hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friends are playing with statistics on what share of taxes are payed by the top 10 per cent, of income earners when that includes those who are ripping off the public through the boardroom excesses that we have seen in the privatised utilities. They are trying to claim that taxation is somehow fair with the proportion of gross income going in tax from the top fifth of the population is less than that from the bottom fifth. If the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends think that it is right to change the tax system so that a heavier and heavier burden falls on middle and lower income Britain and that that will persuade the electorate at a general election, he and his colleagues have another think coming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Legg 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from what the hon. Gentleman has said that the Labour party's intention is to promise an increase in the higher rate of tax at the next general election. Will he tell us what the top rate of tax would be under Labour?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made it clear that statements on levels of tax and spending will not be made before our general election manifesto is published.—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] Greatly though it frustrates Conservative Members, it is absolutely right that that should be the position because at this stage no party could responsibly make statements about levels of tax and spending—our first Budget in Government could be more than two years away. The electorate will understand that we are being responsible whereas Conservative Members are not. The electorate will understand even more that we are determined to keep promises when we have made them, in contrast to Conservative Members, who broke all the promises that they made. The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Mr. Legg) promised lower taxes in his general election address. I dare say that his electorate are waiting for him to deliver on that promise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman) talked earlier about high earners. The injustice of the imposition of the extra tax burden under this Government is compounded by the fact that the top 1 per cent, of earners are paying only 4 per cent, of the tax rises coming through as a consequence of the two 1993 Budgets, even though they had received no less than 30 per cent, of the income tax cuts since 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0579">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
It all underlines the truth of what Mr. Maples, the vice-chairman of the Conservative party, said in his memorandum:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The rich are getting richer on the backs of the rest, who are getting poorer".</p></blockquote>
That is the perception of the public and the reality of what people are experiencing. When Mr. D. of Shropshire, Mr. R. of York and Mr. G. of Doncaster and millions of others like them up and down the country have not only seen their tax codings, but have experienced the extra money being taken out of their pockets this year by the Conservative Government and have felt more hammer blows from the high tax, high spend, high borrow consequences of Tory economic incompetence, they will not feel good; they will feel very bad and very badly betrayed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman might like to consider a rather more recent and more relevant memorandum from Mr. McKinstry, which said to people such as those whom agony aunt Andy on the Labour Front Bench is citing that we should look at what Labour is like wherever it is in power to know what it would be like in national Government. We should look at the waste and inefficiency that there is in every Labour-run local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking about waste and inefficiency in local authorities on the same day that councils up and down the country, including Conservative councils, are facing dire cuts affecting social services, education and the police service. He must know that Ministers are receiving delegations, including the leaders of Conservative groups—I was there when the leader of the Conservative group in Oxfordshire protested to the Minister about the effects of the cuts that the Government are ramming through for Oxfordshire. We are not talking about the prospect of fat being trimmed—anything of that nature went years ago. The current cuts are going right to the bone and doing real damage to vital local services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People will form a judgment based on the blows that they have suffered as a consequence of the Government's incompetent and unfair policies. They will feel badly betrayed and no amount of pre-election tax bribery will win them back because they know what happened after the election of a Conservative Government who promised tax cuts. The electorate know only too well that those promises were broken and taxes were increased. They know that the Conservatives are not to be trusted on income tax and no more to be trusted with government—that is the fate awaiting Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not detain the Committee for long. I want to continue ever so gently the discussion that I had when I intervened on the hon. Gentleman and to make a few points about tax policy in relation to income tax, about which I feel strongly. Since this is my first speechlet in Committee, I should begin by saying that it is well known that I am parliamentary adviser to the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Hon. Members should bear that in mind, although what I have to say about clause 29 is based upon a view which I have held about the tax system for many years and which predates my involvement with the institute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is mistaken to dismiss too readily, as he tried to do, my focus on the top 10 per cent, of
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
income earners. He must know that slightly more than nine out of 10 of all income tax payers pay it either at the introductory rate of 20 per cent, or at the standard rate of 25 per cent. It is therefore relevant to consider the increased share of the burden that is now borne by the top 10 per cent, of income earners. Under this Government, a sensible structure and base to income tax means that we are likely to receive revenue more cost effectively than if a peaky and troughy structure of income tax were in place. That will form the substance of what I shall say to the Committee in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor and his successors, as the years and years of Tory Government roll ahead of us, will examine not so much the marginal rates of tax or, indeed, the rates of tax in isolation from the tax base, but the overall impact of the tax system, by making an assessment for the benefit of the House and the country of the effective rates of tax. The hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee will know that there is an important distinction between marginal rates and effective rates. Effective rates give a more accurate impression of the true burden of a regime of income tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged the importance and power of effective rates of tax, will he respond to my point that, since the Government have been in office, the effective rate of taxation on the poorest 20 per cent, of income earners has gone above the effective rate of taxation on the richest income earners?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that fact. By my own logic, I should like the effective rate of tax to be lowered for people at all levels of income. What has happened is unfortunate. The hon. Gentleman must consider the effects of the longest recession since the war, from which we have emerged, to realise how that can distort tax—it is possible for the effective tax on people at all levels of income to increase more than Ministers and Conservative Members would wish. I hope that it will not be long until we return to a tax policy where, when it is prudent to do so, we can reduce the effective rates of tax at all levels of income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always favoured, as did the man for whom I was proud to work, the noble Lord Lawson, the idea of lower rates of tax, lower reliefs and, indeed, fewer reliefs. My argument is strengthened by the extra revenue that is brought in by some of the smaller changes in tax policy under clause 29, whereby the restriction of the married couple's allowance to 15 per cent., to which the hon. Gentleman referred, will raise an extra £740 million in the current tax year 1995–96, and the restriction of mortgage interest relief to 15 per cent, will raise an additional £880 million. That underlines the fact that granting tax relief of that sort is expensive, and taking it away recoups revenue which should never have been lost to the cause of tax relief on the scale that it has been in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a general point about the principle of tax relief and how it should be approached. I want the tax system to be steered in such a direction that it becomes a cost-effective way of raising revenue. If members of the Committee or Members of Parliament want to help certain deserving causes in society, it is much more honest, transparent and appropriate to do that through the public expenditure side of public accounts, rather than through

the somewhat indirect and unnecessarily expensive tax allowance or tax expenditure side. That argument will be familiar to many of my hon. Friends and I know it has been advanced in the Committee before by them. It is an argument that is worth endorsing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I sit down, I ask my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary, whom I believe is to reply to this debate, to tell the Committee now—or later if that is more convenient—what the latest Treasury estimate is of all the various tax allowances against income tax. The leading examples of such allowances are mortgage interest relief, married couple's allowance and the various forms of pension relief. When debating the issue of income tax, its incidence and the way in which it affects different groups in the population, the Committee should be aware of those figures. Clearly there is an important trade-off between moving toward a system of tax that relies on a broader base, lower rates, greater tax simplicity and greater tax efficiency in order to raise revenue, and moving backwards to the sort of tax system that we had in this country, most noticeably before 1979, which contained very expensive and significant tax reliefs to offset the very high—both marginal and effective—rates of taxation which applied in those days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly support the thrust of what the Government are trying to do, albeit in a modest series of steps, in clause 29. But I urge my right hon. Friend to have a word with our right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor to see whether further significant progress can be made towards cutting back on the number of reliefs and lowering the rates of taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make just two points about the direction in which the changes that we are debating are taking us, and the Government's strategy in moving us in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point is the extraordinarily deep cynicism that exists throughout the machinery of government about the Government's objectives. The Government are clearly aiming to be able to introduce substantial reductions in the headline rate of income tax next year, in order—they hope—to buy electoral support in the next general election. But there is a severe problem in the Government's total focus on that objective. The people in the civil service and elsewhere who are responsible for developing and delivering the Government's policies are now of the impression that that is the Government's only objective. Any other goal or direction for the nation has been abandoned and everything is focused on delivering those income tax reductions next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington held out the prospect of the Conservative Government rolling on—I think that was the term he used—for many years to come. However, it is the view of those who work in Government that the Conservative party has not the slightest idea of what it will do in Government beyond achieving those tax cuts—specifically, reductions in the headline rate of income tax—next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A deep cynicism is being created in the machinery of government as a result of that desperate bid to win votes and it is doing great damage both to the people we represent and to the country as a whole. I must say that one would have to be very optimistic, given the experience of the past few years, to believe that those tax
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
cuts will buy support on the scale that is needed. We shall find out the truth in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elsewhere this afternoon, the effects of the reduction in schools' budgets around the country are being debated. The cuts are being made not because they are demanded by the economic situation, but because they will help to cut income tax next year in the run-up to a general election. That is a cynical strategy—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the economic situation did not demand cuts. Is he satisfied with the current level of the public sector borrowing requirement, and could he say what level of PSBR the Labour party would find acceptable? None of his colleagues has been able to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point about the current level of the PSBR was well answered by my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East. I do not intend to add to his comments. I notice, however, that the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) said in his election manifesto:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Reduced taxation gives choice to the people and provides the vital boost our economy needs."</p></blockquote>
Since he made that comment, the level of taxation has been significantly increased. The Government have failed to deliver that fundamental objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In which direction are the changes taking us? The burden of taxation has shifted from the best-off to the less well-off. That point has already been made this afternoon and I shall not repeat the figures. The least well-off 20 per cent, in our society pay a larger share of their income in tax than the best-off 20 per cent. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, to his credit, expressed regret about that. I hope that all members of the Committee can unite on that point, and agree that it is a matter of deep regret. Labour Members would go a good deal further than regretting it. It is not good enough to suggest that the changes are an unfortunate by-product of the recession, as the hon. Gentleman seemed to suggest. They are not a by-product of the recession; they are the result of a deliberate Government policy to shift the burden of taxation from the best-off and to penalise the least well-off. That has occurred systematically over the past 10 years. Tax cuts in the mid-1980s benefited high earners; now tax increases are hitting not those people, but those on the lowest incomes. The money that was given away in the mid-1980s is being clawed back, but from different people, and from those who can afford it least. In my constituency, I see the effects of those policies. There is growing concern about the social division and damage being caused in east London by the Government's tax policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington discussed the burden that is being carried by the richest 10 per cent. I have not seen the figures that he mentioned. However, I have seen the results of a study that was carried out last year by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It looked at the effect of tax changes on the best-off 10 per cent, over the previous 10 years, and included last year's Budget. It found that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the tax changes reduced the net incomes of the poorest 10 per cent, by nearly 3 per cent, and increased those of the richest 10 per cent, by nearly 6 per cent."</p></blockquote>
Its view is that the richest 10 per cent, have done very well from the Government's changes to the taxation system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in the midst of creating vast inequality, huge social division and, as a result, enormous problems, which are gradually becoming apparent. Perhaps they were not apparent in the 1980s but, day by day, they are becoming more apparent and we shall have to deal with the deeply damaging effects of those changes for many years to come. I hope that there will be a radical change in direction very soon and that we shall stop hammering those who are least able to sustain it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I favour the simplification of taxation and of tax legislation and I want to support what my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman) said. When I initiated a debate on this subject about five years ago, the Treasury quite rightly pointed out that when the Government took office in 1979, there were six or seven different rates of income tax, starting at 33 per cent, and going up to 98 per cent. By 1990, we had just two rates of tax: the basic rate of 25 per cent, and the higher rate of 40 per cent. So, in some ways, I regarded it as a retrograde step when, in 1992, my right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Thames (Mr. Lamont) introduced what is called the lower rate of 20 per cent., not because I am against lower tax rates, but because it causes considerable administrative complication and a great deal of extra work in calculating the tax liability of millions of income tax payers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sooner we return to a basic and a higher rate the better. However, I should like the basic rate to move towards 20 per cent., as I am sure would all my right hon. and hon. Friends. We should be able to achieve that. It is difficult to achieve tax reform while it is necessary to increase taxes. Tax reform is much easier when one can lower taxes. One sees the prospect of being able to lower taxes in forthcoming Budgets and I hope that it will be possible, at the same time, to reform taxation. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington who said that he favoured a broader tax base and lower tax rates. Again, that has been achieved during the past 16 years or so by successive Treasury Ministers. Several tax reliefs have been eliminated altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington about where the cost of all these reliefs can be found is not in the Red Book but, appropriately, in the public expenditure White Paper. Each of those tax reliefs is, in effect, the equivalent of public spending. How much does tax relief on mortgage interest cost? The answer is that the cost has come down considerably during recent years, partly because interest rates have come down and partly because the rate at which relief is given has been reduced. But I can remember a time when that one tax relief cost £6 billion or £7 billion a year. It is equally possible to add up all the tax reliefs given on occupational pension schemes and to come up with a large sum. I am not suggesting that all those tax reliefs should be done away with, but I think that my hon. Friend is entirely right to say that we need to look at both sides of the equation. When we consider the different rates of tax set out in clause 29, we must be
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
aware of the size of the tax base that is being subjected to those tax rates. I hope that when we debate a similar clause next year, there will not be "A", "B" and "C", but simply "A" and "B"—a basic and a higher rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: During debates on taxation in the past three year, we have talked to several Ministers, none of whom ever answered the questions that we asked about broken promises. Today we have continued the theme that we have been pressing since the general election. I hope that the Chief Secretary, who is new to his job and new to the Committee, will give a slightly more convincing answer than his predecessor did to Opposition Members who want to press the point once again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Chancellor tried to justify the view that the recession ended and recovery began in 1993, he said that the recovery began well before we left the exchange rate mechanism. That is recorded in 
	<i>Hansard</i> for everyone to read. The challenge I threw out to the previous Chief Secretary was simple. I do not know whether the current Chief Secretary shares his predecessor's opinion or whether he believes that recovery was started by our leaving the ERM; it would be interesting to know. If it is true that recovery began before we left the ERM, the Government must have been aware of the recovery beginning and need not have entered an election misleading the British people in the way that they did. When challenged about the tax increases after the election, the previous Chief Secretary's only answer was, "Well, of course, we did not realise the state that the economy was in or that the recovery was going to take so long to start." There were clear differences in the answers of the previous Chancellor and the previous Chief Secretary, it would be nice to know whom the current Chief Secretary believes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the general election campaign, the Government talked of public sector borrowing requirement figures of about £35 billion and, miraculously, after the election, the forecast for those figures increased to £50 billion. Either the Government did not know before the election what was going on in the economy and their incompetence was absolute and complete or they knew and their misleading of the British people was not accidental but deliberate. Again, it would be interesting to know the Chief Secretary's view of that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I happened to play a game of squash on Sunday evening and, having finished and feeling rather exhausted, I started chatting to a club member in the bar who, I know, has always voted Conservative and nothing but. Occasionally, however, we talk on a social basis and he chats to me about how he sees things from the point of view of his small building business. He is a good example of the sort of person who, in the past, voted Conservative. He asked me how I was getting on and I replied that I thought that we were doing quite a good job down in Westminster. I asked him how he was getting on. He replied, "It wouldn't be so bad if I actually had a job to do. In the 36 years that I've been building, I've never known business so bad. In fact, the past three years have been the worst for my business that I've ever known. Of course, you know what's going to happen now." I thought that he was going to say that there was going to be a recovery, and that houses would be built once more and provide him with work. "No," he said, "they'll try to bribe me with tax cuts to vote for them next time. Anyone can see that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
coming. If they think that's going to work, they've got another think coming."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other people are also wiser than the Government give them credit for being. Tax cuts have been trailed so widely that people can see them coming. People are expecting tax cuts but those cuts will not work. That self-employed man, with his small building business, who has always voted Conservative, says, "Never Conservative again." He has had enough. I am sure that many people share precisely that opinion. They will not be bribed with their own money by tax cuts in the next Budget before the general election. Like many others, that man will never trust the Tories on tax again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bournemouth, West challenged us to talk about the PSBR. Labour members of the Committee are not frightened about talking about the PSBR. Which Government raised the PSBR to £50 billion? That was £50 billion for borrowing—for what? Can we go out and see the assets for which the Government had to borrow to improve the life of our nation? No, we cannot because the Government have squandered that money. That is why people are extremely angry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman trying to tell us that the Labour party would not have borrowed money to protect those whom the world recession had put out of work, those who needed support in terms of their health, those who needed help with the payment of their mortgages and those who needed to be paid unemployment benefit, all aspects that the Labour party professes to hold dear? However, he claims that the Labour party would not have borrowed despite the fact that its income would be falling from all sources of revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not speak for my Front Bench any more than the hon. Gentleman speaks for his. However, my view is simple; there are two legitimate reasons to run the PSBR at a deficit, which are recognised in the convergence criteria in the Maastricht treaty. Countercyclical measures are perfectly proper. Part of the function of Government is to have a role in the economy. I am not sure whether Conservative Members believe that, but we do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The debate is straying too wide of the issues, which concern charges and rates of income tax for 1995–96. We appear to be debating the economy in general and public expenditure in particular. Please can we return to tax rates?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was making the point that it is perfectly proper for a Government to adjust tax rates. That has an effect on the PSBR because the PSBR is produced by the difference between the Government's taxation income, including what comes from income tax, and their expenditure. It is proper that a Government should use long-term borrowing for investment. The lack of distinction between short-term and long-term borrowing in the Government's accounts needs rectification in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are proper reasons for running a PSBR deficit. One of the reasons why we are so angry about the past is
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
that the resources that came from North sea oil and from privatisation were spent on tax cuts during the 1980s to bribe people to keep voting the Conservatives into power rather than on the long-term investment which would have secured the future of our country. There is, therefore, a direct link between past and future tax cuts and the lack of proper investment in our manufacturing industry and infrastructure, in which it would be proper for the Government to invest even if they ran a PSBR deficit to fund it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On taxation, the problem is that the Government are interested in only one thing—their flagship of the marginal rate of income tax. They talk on and on about cutting taxes, but when pressed on the matter, the one point to which they keep returning to try to justify their claim to be tax cutters is the 25 per cent, basic rate of income tax, together with the fact that they have introduced a 20 per cent, rate which applies to some people on part of their earnings. They come back to that over and over again, but we never get a wider picture. The Government do not justify their overall tax position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course the marginal rate of tax is important, but the total taxation that the nation pays is also important. We know that the percentage of gross domestic product paid in tax has gone up from 34.3 per cent, under the previous Labour Government to 37 per cent, now, with further rises forecast by the Government's estimates. Will the Chief Secretary tell us whether he believes that taxation in terms of percentage of gross domestic product is higher now than in 1979 and whether it is forecast to rise during the next 24 months unless the Government bring in measures to cut taxation? I would be interested to hear his comments on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase in taxation has not gone to improve public services; far from it. The amount of GDP spent on public services has fallen, but it is clear that more has gone to pay for the cost of unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are looking at a sleight of hand. The Government use the 25 per cent, basic rate of tax as their justification for claiming to be a low income tax party. But even that is not true. They are not even a low income tax party, as the figures show. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East has already drawn attention to what they have done since the election. Personal allowances were not index linked until this year. It is no use the Chief Secretary saying, "Of course we have index-linked them this year. Read the Finance Bill". That reflects the inflation figures of the past 12 months. It does not make up for the fact that the Government had not index-linked in the previous two years. That failure to index-link still leaves the real value of personal allowances at a lower level than in 1992. That is an income tax increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a pertinent point because the Government have made a claim that even their own supporters know does not add up. However, he is ignoring the fact that at the same time as not indexing the allowances, the Government have increased national insurance contributions by 1 per cent., which is exactly the same in effect as a 1 per cent, increase in the standard rate. The combined effect of all that—and I accept that it is a cumulative argument—is that the Government cannot even persuade their own supporters, never mind Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0583">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Indeed, I was going to make the point about national insurance charges shortly. I was going to point out not only that they are a form of income tax—even the Government could not deny that, although the Chief Secretary might try—but that the Government have actually managed to find a form of income tax that is regressive. That is a unique achievement, even for this Government, and another example of their sleight of hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only have personal allowances not been index linked in previous Budgets, but at me same time, reductions have been made in MIRAS—from 25 per cent, to 20 per cent., and then to 15 per cent.—and in the married couple's allowance, both of which are forms of income tax increases. If the Government had chosen to phase out MIRAS over a period, I would not have been opposed simply on principle. My views are well known; I have had an interest in housing for many years and I have never regarded the tax relief given on mortgage interest as being fair. I would have welcomed a Government initiative that transferred the money spent on MIRAS to higher allowances to help people who are on lower incomes to pay their mortgages and to prevent their homes from being repossessed. That would have been a fairer way in which to spend the money. Instead, at the same time as phasing out MIRAS, the Government removed income support from people who, having become unemployed, needed that money to pay their mortgage. Far from using the money available for housing tax relief in a better way, to help people lower down the income scales, the Government are doing precisely the opposite by phasing out MIRAS and removing assistance from poorer people. That is absolutely wrong. Phasing out MIRAS in that way is simply a way in which to increase taxes and it is part of the package of back-door income tax increases which the Budget does nothing to rectify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the member for Oxford, East made the point that 1 per cent, of British people pay 4 per cent, of the tax increases introduced by the Government since 1992. Those same people received 30 per cent, of the cuts in income tax during the late 1980s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year in this Committee we had considerable debate about charts—whether they should be shown, whether the Chairman should have a copy or whether every member of the Committee should have a copy. Those charts showed the increasingly regressive nature of the Government's taxation policies and how the poor were getting both relatively and absolutely poorer. The 20 per cent, of people at the bottom of the income scales are now worse off than they were when the Conservatives were in power in the early 1980s. That is a unique occurrence this century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of the leaked Maples memo, that statistic fits in nicely with the point that the poor are getting absolutely poorer and that the middle income groups are getting poorer relative to the very rich, who are doing very nicely, thank you, under this Government. Only those who earn more than £64,000 a year pay less tax now than they did in 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only have the Government broken their promises by putting income tax up, but they have raised taxes in a very unfair way. No doubt we shall return to the issue of the rates of direct taxation when next year's Finance Bill
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
is debated and, at that time the Government will produce the cuts that they hope will win them the next election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent months, it has become fashionable in the Chamber to deride the efforts of the now noble Lord Lawson; even Conservative Members make comments about the lack of wisdom in the Lawson boom and about how the Government produced the boom by cutting taxes at the very time when they should not have done so. We have been living with the problems that that created for the economy and with the ensuing inflation ever since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can a Government who believe that a recovery is under way, who believe that everyone is doing well—the manufacturing industry and other sectors of the economy are beginning to prosper and move forward in an appropriate and satisfactory manner—and who are getting a little worried about inflation, to the extent that interest rate rises are implemented, possibly contemplate cutting taxes and putting an enormous amount of extra demand into such an economy? Why are they running the risk of putting us in the same situation as that which followed the Lawson boom? How can a Government who now deride that boom and whose Members castigate Lawson for getting it wrong, then cut taxes at precisely the wrong time? How could they in current circumstances, which they say are going so well apart from the worries about inflation—and they claim to be taking steps to deal with that—possibly contemplate tax cuts in the next two years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone would support the principle of fair taxation, and income tax is the way forward to simplify taxation. Many of my constituents would like the opportunity to pay tax, but for the past 15 years they have lost their jobs in Bradford—we have lost thousands of jobs—and do not have the ability to pay tax. Those who pay tax wonder why they pay it. They do not have the accountants who can work out the tax fiddles and tax dodges that people in higher income brackets enjoy. I am pleased that the Chief Secretary will respond to the debate because since 1979 only people earning more than £64,000 a year pay less tax than they did previously. Why is that the case? How is that fair? People would not mind paying tax if they saw some benefit from it in the services that they receive, but that is not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taxpayers wonder about the assets squandered by the Government to create the public sector borrowing debt. They also wonder about the national assets that have gone, the privatisations that have taken place and the used public money, for example the £400 million to be spent on rail privatisation which will put another public asset in the hands of the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chief Secretary has the opportunity to tell us what is the basis of the Tory tax policy. Is it just about retaining power after the next election, or is there a structure? Is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
there some way that the tax structure will help the rebirth of the economy which will, in turn, help areas such as mine in Bradford, South where a third of the population are on supplementary benefit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People claim more for less. Conservative Members talked about the squandering in local government. My council in Bradford has had £38 million taken out of its budget in the past two years when it tried to spend the limit enforced by the Government through the standard spending assessments. There was no squandering—we were congratulated on council spending by Ministers who came to speak to us about city challenge and the single regeneration budget. There is no squandering in local government. If one compares the squandering that was alleged to have taken place in local government with that of the national Government, the comparison is beyond belief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that Bradford has had £38 million taken out.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Sutcliffe</div> <!-- member -->

Now we are told by Conservative Members that Labour councils are wasteful and do not spend money appropriately. That was not so in Bradford.

Money from taxation goes into public spending. People believe that fair taxation, based on the ability to pay, is important, but there is no evidence of that in Tory tax processes. Will the Chief Secretary tell us the structure of the Tories' future strategy, not just until the next election, but beyond the next election, and how that tax structure and the yield from tax will be maximised at a time when 14,000 jobs are being lost from the Inland Revenue?

I shall respond to the key point about the rise in taxation to which the hon. Gentleman refers, but my first duty, before gallivanting off into those obsessions, is to return to clause 29 of this year's Finance Bill. That is what we are discussing and I remind the Committee that it is a short, simple and innocuous clause which maintains the status quo on income tax rates and widens the lower rate band by twice the amount required by indexation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The widening of the 20 per cent, lower rate band to £3,200 means that one in five of all taxpayers will pay tax at the lower rate of 20p. I would have thought that that change would be generally welcomed, particularly by the 5.5 million people who in 1995–96 will have 20p as their marginal rate of tax. I am surprised that the Labour party apparently intends to vote against this beneficial clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Chief Secretary for giving way, but is it not also true that because of the Government's failure to index link the level at which the 40 per cent, rate band begins, 800,000 more people are paying tax at the 40 per cent, rate than three years ago?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Aitken</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not quite right, but I shall deal with his comments in general terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we shall have a more structured debate if I answer the points that have been made. I begin by replying to the hon. Member for Oxford, East, the Opposition's shadow Chief Secretary. He had to justify his pugnacious opposition to this innocuous clause and to do so he hung out a veritable washing line of prejudices, selective statistics, anonymous letters and tendentious arguments, presumably in the hope that the Committee would be distracted from the clause that we are discussing. An old saying is that Oxford is the home of lost causes, and so it seemed from the hon. Gentleman's speech. One of the best and most accurate parts of his speech was the long extract that he read out from the Budget speech of my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but he immediately followed that with references to illusion and deceit. I found it hard to link those words with the Budget speech. I suppose that his point was the same as that made by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts), who said that, at the last election, the Conservative party had campaigned on the pledge that it would try to reduce taxation, but we had in fact raised it. Of course we acknowledge, with great regret, that taxes have had to rise during our term in office, but the Government should be judged, as the Prime Minister said this afternoon, over the period of a Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taxes rose to cope with the surge in the PSBR, which was caused by the unexpected depth and length of the recession. Labour Members should pause and reflect before they call that inevitable and sensible measure a trick of illusion and deceit. No one should reflect on that more than the hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell), who is the successor to our late, lamented colleague, Mr. John Smith. Perhaps that is why she has been silent. During the 1992 general election John Smith campaigned—as did the party's then leader, now Commissioner Kinnock—on the line that the Labour party would substantially increase public spending. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
leaders of the Labour party felt able to travel up and down the country promising to do that because they believed—as did Conservative Members and independent forecasters—that the recession was coming to an end. We all believed that it was prudent, correct and sensible to make the prediction that the length of the recession would be nowhere near as long or as deep as it turned out to be. No one as honourable as John Smith would have campaigned on a programme of massive increases if they had believed that the recession was getting longer and deeper. If there was illusion and deceit, it was a totally unintentional illusion that was shared equally by Mr. Kinnock, Mr. John Smith and by independent forecasters. They all believed that the recession was likely to end far sooner than it actually did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to intervene, but the Chief Secretary is pushing his luck. It was clear to those of us working in John Smith's office that the Government had made claims which, after the election, they could not substantiate. It was confirmed by the then Chancellor, the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Thames (Mr. Lamont) when the statistical record came out that there had been some sliding of the figures and that the figures that we had seen and on which we prepared our shadow Budget had been carefully constructed, using a bit of economy with the truth. The truth is that the Prime Minister said that the recovery would start on the Friday.

As honourable people, they would not have campaigned on the ticket of large increases in public expenditure if they had had crystal ball-gazing gifts and had known, as the present Labour party implies everybody knew, that it was deceitful to say that the recession was ending and it was all a con trick.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Aitken</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I leave the theme of illusion and deceit, which was the charge levelled at us by the hon. Member for Oxford, East, let me turn to his specious and bogus claims on what he called the average family and what it would be paying in taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman defined the average family as containing one earner on average earnings with two children and a £30,000 mortgage. He claimed, very precisely, that such a family would pay £219.10 extra in tax a year. First—this is a minor mathematical point, but it is typical of the Labour party—that figure is wrong. That family would pay £170 extra in taxation, though I agree that that is a substantial sum nevertheless. But I am attacking the charge of illusion and deceit. If ever there was a deceitful claim, it is that such a family is typical. That so-called average represents less than 1 per cent, of families. That is some average. It is not an average or typical family, but a political family invented by the Labour party to make the Government's tax changes appear far more harmful than they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In truth, the average effect of the 1993 and 1994 Budgets on all families is a taxation increase of approximately £2.30 a week. Against that, households are expected to be about £5 a week better off in real disposable income in 1995 even after the tax changes in those Budgets come fully into effect. If there is any truth at all in the charges of deceit and illusion and the terrible pains and penalties borne by the average family, it is true for 1 per cent, of families in this country. It does not bear serious examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall restrict the number of interventions that I give way to, but I shall take one from the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Timms).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Chief Secretary. May I refer him to some Treasury figures that were quoted in the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> on 20 December, which I believe are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0586">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>
those to which he has just referred? The article states that the Treasury figures show that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a married man on average earnings, with two children, will pay 35.6 per cent, of his earnings in direct and indirect taxes in 1995–96—up from 34.7 per cent, in the current financial year."</p></blockquote>
Those are, I believe, the figures quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East and I am unclear what is the inaccuracy to which the Chief Secretary is drawing the Committee's attention. What was said by Opposition Members is identical to the Treasury's own figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Aitken</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to repeat myself, but the inaccuracy about which I was complaining was that the hon. Member for Oxford, East said that the average family would pay £219.10 extra in tax. In fact, the average effect of both the 1993 and 1994 Budgets on all families will be an increase in taxation of approximately £2.30 a week. That must be balanced against the fact that real disposable incomes will rise by £5 a week. I think that I have dealt with the average or typical family budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now move on to the fascinating saga of the genuine anonymous letters. They raised several valid points. I shall deal first with Mr. D. of Shropshire. Without wishing to issue a serious challenge in this matter, I am slightly suspicious of the bona fides of Mr. D. of Shropshire for the following reason: he wrote to the Prime Minister and I should be surprised if my right hon. Friend forwarded that letter to the hon. Member for Oxford, East. Perhaps the D. stands for "dubious". Forgive my suspicious mind, but it must be one genuine correspondent in a million who would copy his letter both to the Prime Minister and, mysteriously, to the hon. Member for Oxford, East. Perhaps D. stood for "dedicated Labour supporter"—we shall see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. R. of York—Mr. Ready Reckoner of York, he seemed to be—got his concerns slightly wrong. He was most concerned about the extra tax burden that he would have to bear. But Mr. R. was over 75 years old and he should be paying no more tax in 1995–96, because the reduction in the value of the married couple's allowance is cancelled out by the increase over inflation in the personal allowance contained in clause 30, which was referred to in the debate—as you know, Mr. Winterton, there was a great deal of lurching into clause 30 during this debate. Mr. R. was therefore not suffering as much as he thought when he wrote the letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, Mr. G. of Doncaster was worried about mortgage changes. I make the point that real personal disposable incomes after mortgages have risen by approximately 25 per cent.—or £50 a week—since October 1990 for a family on average earnings. The fall in the cost of a mortgage in that same period has been approximately £140 a month. Mr. G. of Doncaster should perhaps have given the full picture and indicated that he was not being quite so badly hit as if he had taken all the facts on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Serious points were raised about the restriction on married couple's allowances. I noticed that the hon. Member for Oxford, East did not say by how much the Labour Government would increase the married couple's allowance, and I challenge him to say so now—but I suppose he will take the usual Trappist vow of silence on the matter. My answer to the hon. Gentleman on that
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
matter is this: last year it was necessary to take several hard decisions in order to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement. Married couple's allowance goes to a wide range of couples, some of whom clearly have a greater claim to extra tax relief than others and some of whose needs are greater than others. Restricting the married couple's allowance to a flat rate removed the extra benefit that higher-rate taxpayers derived from the allowance, making it worth the same to every tax-paying married couple. I am inclined to agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington. He said that the married couple's allowance is not a cost-effective way of raising revenue. I took his point very much to heart.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chief Secretary has just indicated his agreement with the comments of his hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Aitken</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I was not saying any such thing. Any future decisions on the married couple's allowances are for future Budgets. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor is right to have drawn attention to the fact that the married couple's allowance is anomalous and that targeting is not good. However, we are not considering its future now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I should be interested to know whether that proposal has been accepted as Labour party policy.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what they always say in Islington.

My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington asked a technical question about the cost of reliefs. Our estimation of the total cost of tax relief for occupational personal pensions, mortgage interest relief, the married couple's allowance and related allowances for widows and single parents is £15 billion for 1995–96.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Timms) was fascinated by the Government's strategy beyond the next general election, which was very encouraging of him. He kept saying that everything is being focused on tax cuts next year. I imagine that he reads that in "Labour Weekly", or some such publication. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor has constantly said that we shall reduce taxation—that is our core belief—as soon as it is prudent to do so. The Government have deservedly earned a reputation for prudence in their stewardship of the national finances and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
we shall not depart from that reputation just because "Labour Weekly" or any other publication is bellowing either out of fear or enthusiasm for us to make tax cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a tax cut dividend is possible in the next year or so, the hon. Gentleman's strategic question about what we might do can be answered by pointing out that there is a great divide between our two parties on this issue. The Labour party has an interventionist philosophy—it would like to take taxpayers' money and spend it on ever-growing government. We can see an ever-growing list of quangos, such as regional assemblies and defence conversion agencies. There is also the Labour party's minimum wage to consider. The length of spending commitments continues to grow. Later on, I may embarrass one or two of the Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen by asking them what spending increases they have promised in their election pledges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have a simple philosophy—if there is a tax dividend, we leave it in the pockets of the people who have earned it. That is our core belief when it comes to tax cuts. We want to leave money in the pockets of those who, by the sweat of their brows, earned it in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield reminded us that when Labour left office, there were seven or eight different rates of taxation. Those rates started at 98 per cent, and went down to 33 per cent. When we compare those figures to the ones that we are discussing in our debate today, we can appreciate the huge change for the better that has taken place and the fact that our system has been transformed and simplified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I dealt with the questions of the hon. Member for Attercliffe about misleading the electorate at the general election, so I will refer to his revelations about his lugubrious squash partner, who saw nothing but gloom
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
and dismay about him. He does not seem to realise that, throughout Britain and especially in the north of England—in industrial cities such as Sheffield—a remarkable recovery is taking place, with 4 per cent, economic growth, export growth breaking all records at 13 per cent, and 2,000 people a day coming off the unemployment register. The hon. Gentleman's friend has been concentrating too much on squash balls, or even perhaps the Ball's memorandum about neo-endogenous growth zones, and has overlooked genuine recovery in every region of Britain. Perhaps the squash partner's business is not doing as well as it might be, but practically every survey from the Confederation of British Industry, small business and chambers of commerce throughout the country shows a real and genuine recovery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Chief Secretary accept that recovery is from a position of low activity, because much of manufacturing industry in towns like Sheffield was destroyed during the 1980s?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Aitken</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>6 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Aitken</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me come to a conclusion. One theme that ran through many speeches made by Opposition Members, certainly that made by the hon. Member for Bradford, South, was that today's tax system is unfair—the rich are paying less, the poor are paying more and everyone is getting poorer. I have some figures about the share of income tax that disprove those excitable claims—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0588">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
the clause is, after all, about income tax. When Labour was in power, the top 10 per cent, of taxpayers were paying 35 per cent, of total income tax, whereas in 1995–96, the top 10 per cent, of taxpayers are paying 44 per cent, of total income tax. Specialist observers of economic theory might like to recall the Laffer curve which suggested that if the top rates of taxation were reduced, it would often stimulate economic growth and increase the take of taxation. That is precisely what has happened as a result of the admirable policies pursued by successive Conservative Governments under my noble Friend Lady Thatcher and my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. The top rate of tax has been brought down to a competitive level in the international arena. As a result, the take of income tax has increased from what it was under Labour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the notion that everyone, in particular the poor, are getting poorer under Conservative Government, the real rise in take-home pay for a family during Labour's years in power was £1.50 a week, or 0.6 per cent.—a stingy figure. A single person's take-home pay fell by 2.8 per cent, in real terms. The real rise in take-home pay from 1979 to 1994–95 for a family was £82.80, or 39.9 per cent., and for a single person, £85.80, or 47.7 per cent. Under Conservative Governments, there has been a creditable real-terms growth in take-home pay and disposable income. That is the answer to many of the Opposition's unfair grumbles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the Chief Secretary is talking of statistics, does he challenge the statistic that by 1992, the poorest fifth of households paid 39 per cent, of their incomes in tax, while the richest fifth of households paid 34 per cent, of their incomes in tax?

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know enough of my exchanges with the hon. Gentleman to know not to accept his statistics without further examination. Off the cuff, I do not confirm those. However, I shall consider carefully his figures but I suspect that they leave out the wide range of benefits relevant to those on the lowest incomes, such as housing benefit. Those should be included in the statistic and would make it look very different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by dealing with the accusation that this is a heartless, high-tax, high-spend Government. The figures that I have quoted show that real disposable incomes have increased very creditably under the Conservative Government. When it comes to high spend, let me remind the Committee that in the previous two Budgets public expenditure was reduced by a projected total of £43 billion. The statements and promises made by Opposition Members in their election addresses—not to mention what the party was pledging—reveal a catalogue of high-spend promises. For example, the hon. Member for Oxford, East in his election address promised £1 billion for the national health service, £600 million for education, £1 billion for an economic recovery programme, increased child benefit of £9.95 a child, a proposed legal minimum wage of £3.40 an hour and an increase in pensions of £5 for single people and £8 for couples.

The hon. Member for Bristol, South, in her previous incarnation as a health spokesman, promised that Labour would put a penny on income tax to deal with underfunding and underinvestment in the health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not mind being quoted by the Chief Secretary; I just wish he would quote me correctly. He is quoting from an article in the 
	<i>British Medical Journal</i> where I was asked a question about hypothecated tax, and whether people would be prepared to pay another penny on income tax. My answer was not advanced as Labour party policy. That just goes to show how inaccurate the information is that the Chief Secretary is using here. To set the record straight, Mr. Winterton, I shall bring a copy of the full article to the next sitting of the Committee and hon. Members can make up their own minds while participating in proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Aitken</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rather thought the hon. Lady confirmed my words with that somewhat tortuous explanation.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Aitken</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would gladly run through the long list of those commitments, but that would detain the Committee for several hours and it is in the interests of the Committee to make progress. But I shall give one or two examples of Labour commitments: the quango list, the regional assemblies, the Scottish Parliament, the defence conversion agency and the minimum wage are all proposals that would cost money. In addition, the cost of the pledge to disburse the capital receipts from local authorities could total £6 billion. There is a list of Labour spending pledges as long as my arm. Labour's taxation pledges include a tourism tax, a pollution tax, a payroll tax, an entertainment tax—I could continue down the list. The policies of the Opposition are high tax and high spend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am assuming that the right hon. Gentleman is coming to the end of his speech. The Chief Secretary has been accused by members of the Committee of not keeping his promises. I do not want him to break another promise. Earlier in the debate he was good enough to give way to my intervention and he promised me an answer to the second part of my question. I want him to fulfil that promise before he resumes his seat. He confirmed that his right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor said that the tax increases are equivalent to a 7p increase on the basic rate of taxation. The second part of the question, following that confirmation, was whether he would also confirm—he said he would reply—that to get back to the pre-1993 Budget taxation levels, the Government would have to reduce taxation by at least the equivalent of 7p on the basic rate of income tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Aitken</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misses the point. The point is that we did not increase income tax by 7p on the basic rate. We believe that high rates of income tax increase disincentives and damage growth, which is why we did not raise income tax by 7p.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that. I asked the Chief Secretary to confirm the Chancellor's remarks that the increases in taxation since 1993 amounted to the equivalent of 7p on the basic rate, and the right hon. Gentleman did so. The second part of my question was to ask him to confirm that to return to the pre-1993 Budget taxation levels, the Government would have to cut taxation by at least the equivalent of 7p on the basic rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Aitken</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the hon. Gentleman's first question, I gave him the best answer that I could at the time, namely, that if the hon. Gentleman had quoted from 
	<i>Hansard</i> correctly I would confirm that the Chancellor's words were as he read them. He also asked whether the 1993 changes amounted to the equivalent of 7p on the basic rate. That is not a fair comparison. The point is that we did not increase income tax by 7p because we believed that that would create disincentives and damage growth. I do not accept that the hon. Gentleman was comparing like with like.

The Liberal Democrats helpfully produced a document recently which showed that the Labour party has made spending pledges of £13 billion, which is equivalent to 5p on income tax.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall end on rather a sombre note. We have so far had a jolly debate that we have all enjoyed. The clause is small and innocuous. It maintains the status quo on levels of taxation and will help those on low incomes. We have had had a wide-ranging argument about taxation and spending. However, I have not extracted anything from Labour Members about their policy, other than the cry "Total fantasy."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reflected earlier this afternoon that we are sitting here under the famous Salisbury portrait of the internment of the unknown soldier. That is most appropriate, in the sense that we are debating the unknown economic policies of the Labour party. We have asked Labour Members many questions—for example, will they put taxation up or down? Will they put public spending up or down? Will they put public borrowing up or down? We have not had an answer to any of those questions. However, we have answered all such questions in clause 29, which says it all on the subject of the Government's taxation rates. Our policy is clear and simple and it encourages the trend for more people to pay tax at the lowest possible rate of 20 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that is might help the Committee if I allowed the standard, two-party confrontation to continue without unnecessary intervention or prolongation. However, the role of the Liberal Democrats has been quoted and as the Chief Secretary refused to give way to me earlier, I thought that it might be appropriate to make one or two points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the general context of the debate, I do not think that the Chief Secretary satisfactorily addressed the discrepancy between the Government's pre-election promises and the reality of what has happened since then. His explanation was that things did not turn out as they had expected at the time of the election, which is every politician's—or, indeed, economist's—cop-out after the event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One hon. Member said that the Prime Minister's slogan was, "Vote for us on Thursday and recovery will continue on Friday". The clear suggestion was that the Government were forecasting a continued, sustained recovery and, on the basis of that, they were confidently predicting tax cuts. Given that that did not happen, we are faced with only two possible conclusions—either the Government were telling lies or they were telling the truth, but their economic policies of 15 years' standing were such that they were not in control of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chief Secretary seems to have preferred the second explanation of the Government bobbing around like a cork pursuing economic policies that have no real impact
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
on the economy as a whole; taking credit for anything that happens in spite of the fact that it has nothing whatever to to with them and they did not forecast it; and blaming everything that goes wrong on other factors such as the world recession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My party published commentaries on the Labour party programme and we are doing similar work on the Conservative programme and our own—
	<i>[Laughter.]</i> We have made it clear that we believe that the public are entitled to an honest presentation of priorities founded on the different philosophical approaches of the different parties, setting out what are commitments, what are aspirations and what a programme would cost. The Labour party say that it is all fantasy. It is interesting to know that Labour party speeches are just fantasy and that all the promises are utterly meaningless and empty. I did not expect anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members are making speeches about what they want to offer, but those proposals have costs attached to them. It is perfectly reasonable to say—as the hon. Member for Oxford, East does—that the proposals are only a set of aspirations in no particular order with no particular timetable, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that, come a general election, people will be entitled to know how proposals are prioritised, when they will be phased in and what they will cost. We are trying to ensure that that is offered by the Labour party, by the Conservative party, by the Liberal Democrats and by others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is where the tax calculation comes in, because it is based on an overall assessment. The Government have at least initiated a discussion about that, even if we do not all agree with their conclusions on the appropriate way to apportion tax among different tax rates and different taxpayers. As has been said, under the Government the burden of taxation has shifted sharply to lower-income groups and away from higher-income groups. There is a legitimate justification for a debate on whether that process has gone too far and whether we need to consider ways of shifting the balance back. It would not be especially constructive to row in completely the opposite direction in the next five to 10 years from that taken over the past 10 years. That would have a destabilising effect. There is a strong argument for continuity and predictability, tempered by any particular political party's judgment about what is a fair distribution, how redistribution will take place and who is to pay for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have, perhaps understandably, had to respond to an attack on why everything has gone wrong. There is an obligation on the Government to explain why, after 17 years, they have been unable to deliver on any of their pledges and why taxes in total are higher than they were when they came to power. All that has happened is a redistribution away from the higher paid, putting more of the burden on to the lower paid. That is not a radical restructuring; it is not a miracle or an economic transformation; it is simply shaking out the same amount of money and doing what we would all expect the Conservative party to do—give it to their friends and take it away from those who did not vote for them. That is the reality of what has happened and that is what the political debate is really about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PERSONAL ALLOWANCE</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are some supplementary points that I want to raise. Allowances have been covered, but some specific problems arise in the clause and I want to ask the Minister what the Government are doing on allowances. It is interesting that on several occasions today Ministers have treated the Opposition as if they were the Government and sought our views on future direction. However, this is a Government Bill and it is for the Government to answer the questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 30 the Government raise the age-related married couple's allowance above indexation for those aged 65 and over and those aged 75 and over. Other allowances that have been indexed and are not being increased above that have not been mentioned in the clause. Some allowances, however, are not being touched. They include the widow's bereavement allowance, the additional relief for single parents, the relief for maintenance in the year of separation and the married couple's allowance. Those allowances have not been indexed and remain stable. To the people involved, that will mean a cut in the amount of money to which they are entitled. The freezing of each allowance to 20 per cent, in 1994–95 will cost those who are entitled to claim them £96 in the current year, and freezing the allowances in 1995–96 will cost them an additional £96.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the Government's aims has supposedly been to simplify taxation. Allowances were used as a means of recognising the status of people in the income tax arena. The methods of dealing with that are changeable. In some years allowances are indexed. The Rooker-Wise amendment means that basic allowances must be indexed unless the Government take action to change that—which is what the clause does. In some years allowances are frozen and in some years they are increased by more than inflation. There is no pattern or clarity. The blind person's allowance has again been left and Ministers have said that it is not being changed because it was given a big hike last time it was increased. There is no clarity in the way in which the Government are using allowances as part of the income tax structure and the decisions that people must make about their personal finances are becoming increasingly difficult because the pattern is so higgledy-piggledy. Some groups are finding that the value of their allowance is gradually being eroded while the Government are not making it clear that they have any coherent plans to change the structure. It may be that the Government have decided that, because more people are not getting married, they will phase out the married couple's allowance and transfer the burden onto other groups in society. It may be that they want to give a message to single-parent families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are all sorts of policies that the Government may be pursuing through the tax structure. We are anxious to know what the Government are aiming to do with allowances as part of the income tax structure. In his speech in the previous debate, the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington was also asking for clarification on that. Are the Government serious in trying to move to a system that is more comprehensible to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
taxpayer? If so, the arguments revolve around self-assessment, to which we shall return later in our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current means of tackling allowances is making it more difficult for the individual taxpayer to predict what the Government may be doing this year or next year with allowances across the board. The Minister will know that there has been considerable disquiet among blind people, for example, about what is happening to them. I am not pressing any amendments on the issue, but I am looking for some clarity because individual taxpayers are confused about the way in which the Government are tackling the issue and we need some consistency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your correction, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is very straightforward and its purpose should be totally clear. It can in no way be described as higgledy-piggledy. We are trying to give additional help to pensioners. I can do no better than to quote the Chancellor's Budget speech:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I want to do a little bit more for pensioners. I propose to increase the age-related personal allowance by more than indexation. The allowances for everyone aged 65 and over will be increased by £430. Nearly 3 million pensioners will gain from this, at a cost of £200 million in a full year".—
	<i>[Official Report,</i> 29 November 1994; Vol. 250, c. 1102.]</p></blockquote>
That is a logical, sensible and clear policy which I would have thought the Labour party would have approved of because it clearly gives help to a group of people who sometimes write to us saying that they are part of the nearly poor who need a little bit of extra help. The allowances are worth more than £2 a week to most basic rate paying pensioners, which should be a clear and welcome addition to their budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Ms Armstrong) tried to lead me off into a wider discussion on the philosophy of allowances and possible future Government strategies. I think that I might be ruled out of order if I were to go off in such vague directions, but I will answer her point on the blind person's allowance, which was included in this year's Budget. No blind person need fear the Government's action when the full facts are understood. The blind person's allowance was doubled in 1991 from £540 per annum to £1,080 per annum and it was increased further to £1,200 per annum in 1994–95. That represents an increase in real terms of almost 70 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All blind people have benefited far more from those Government decisions than they would have if we had done only what the hon. Lady was hoping we would do—treat all allowances as a good socialist planner would and simply move them all up equally under the same formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, the Government like all Governments—including Labour or Liberal Governments—have their
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
priorities. They try to target those people who need help. Benefits for all can be the enemy of proper care for the few, as can benefits that are universally and automatically uprated in line with inflation. In order to help those most in need, good targeting of benefits is a sensible and wise policy. That is why we targeted the blind person's allowance and I do not think it is at all fair to hear the cry that the Government are unkind to blind people. That is a false and unjustifiable allegation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for pensioners who will benefit from clause 30, any Government would be entitled to say that they felt that pensioners should be a policy priority, especially this year in which pensioners have expressed all sorts of worries. Like all Governments, we listened to our pensioner constituents. My constituency contains a very high number of pensioners and so I am among many Members of Parliament who listen carefully to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that clause 30 will be popular. There is no higgledly-piggledy or chaotic thinking behind the clause. It is a well-targeted improvement in benefits for pensioners and I hope that the Committee will accept the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CHARGE AND RATE OF CORPORATION TAX FOR 1995</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause is the only clause that offers the opportunity to talk about corporation tax. I am sure that the Minister will tell us that clause 31 is perfectly simple and straightforward and that it simply reaffirms that the rate of corporation tax will remain at 33 per cent.—the rate at which it was set in 1991 and at which it has remained. The clause and the Budget confirm that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage, I want to quiz the Financial Secretary on Government thinking on corporation tax. Last year a Committee was set up to examine the manner in which companies were able to invest and the relationship of the tax regime to investment. The right hon. Gentleman's predecessor as Financial Secretary, who is now the Secretary of State for National Heritage, announced in early 1994 that there would be a review of the taxation of savings and the flow of funds through the economy. Many people expected that review to provide some indication of how the Government might use, among other things, the taxation system to encourage investment and to encourage industry to seek long-term investment strategies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it was decided that the review would not publish its report—Lord Hanson had something to do with that decision. He did not think that the Government should have anything to do with such intervention, so the Government announced that the review had been completed, but no report was to be produced. We can only assume either that the report came up with nothing or that what it did come up with was not acceptable. The Bill makes no changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have here one of the few opportunities in the Budget to make the case for a review of corporate taxation which will lead to increased business investment. I know that you, Mr. Winterton, take that very seriously.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
However, I shall say no more on that matter than you would want me to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the system of corporate taxation does not treat investment fairly. Distortions arise in several ways. Tax relief is not available for the cost of financing investment from returned earnings. Work by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that that may have an effect as large as an extra one or two percentage points on interest rates, thus depressing business investment seriously over the long term. Corporation tax treats financing investment by borrowing more favourably than it treats financing through equity. Capital allowances are believed by many in manufacturing to discriminate against the type of investment in which companies incur the cost of expenditure on plant machinery and buildings in one year, but can only claim tax relief on that expenditure over several years. There are concerns about how the non-indexation of capital allowances imposes an extra inflation charge on the post-tax cost investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Complaints by industrialists and organisations such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies point to the need for a thorough review of how we treat corporate taxation, so that we can shift the ability and commitment to invest in order to build up our manufacturing industry. It is interesting to note that last year, in an unprecedented, concerted plea, seven leading industrial associations called on the Chancellor to take action to promote investment through four different means. They wanted a tapered rate for capital gains tax on corporate equity, to encourage longer-term holding. A first year 100 per cent, depreciation allowance for the first £200,000 of investment in plant and machinery was called for as an incentive for investment. That would especially benefit small companies. They also wanted the real value of existing capital allowances for plant and machinery and the amount of public expenditure on transport, education and export support maintained because those contribute to the long-term productive potential of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that the Government take up all those ideas immediately. However, we are sympathetic to that approach and would like the Government to examine such concepts more carefully because industrialists have been pressing them on the Labour party and the Government. The Budget and the Finance Bill are disappointing because the Government did not take the opportunity to examine how the taxation system could be used more effectively to encourage investment and to shift from short-term to more long-term investment decisions. That is put off year after year and it is having a severe effect, particularly on manufacturing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to thank you, Mr. Winterton, for giving me the opportunity to raise those points, which are not specifically dealt with anywhere in the Bill. I thought it appropriate to raise them in relation to this clause, which is simple and straightforward in that it leaves corporation tax at exactly the same rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady was entirely right to draw to the Committee's attention the fact that we should not consider only the rate of corporation tax. As we said earlier in relation to income tax, we must also consider the tax base—that is, to ask what one is taxing, which is what an inward investor would examine. A rate of 33 per cent, is attractive to inward investors, although I see evidence
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
that some European countries now have rates lower than 33 per cent., and I would encourage my right hon. and hon. Friends to keep an eye on the rate of UK corporation tax. It may be that we should lower it further to 32, 31 or 30 per cent, in order to remain competitive and attract inward investment. It is an important factor in attracting companies from South Korea, Japan and America. But not only the rate is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady was right to say that it is also a question of which profits one taxes and how one computes the taxable profit for corporation tax purposes. For example, how should we take account of investment? The hon. Lady said that it was not reasonable only to allow a proportion of the capital allowances when a company has to pay 100 per cent, in its first year. In accounting for capital investment, the asset is written off over the period for which it is used. It is sensible to try to equate capital allowances for tax purposes with the rate at which assets are depreciated for accounts purposes. In other words, there is much to be said for taxing as profit an amount which roughly equates to the amount that appears in the accounts. Adjustments have to be made because the amounts are not absolutely equal, but it is sensible to do that because greater incentives to invest distort investment decisions—but that is another debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about the tax base is important and it will come up again when we debate clause 75 on thin capitalisation. That clause looks technical, but it is not technical to inward investors, who want to know how the Government deal with the relationship between the amount of equity and the amount of debt brought in with investment. We shall deal with that later, but it is not irrelevant to this clause because this clause is only part of the corporation tax equation. The hon. Lady was right to draw to the Committee's attention the fact that we need to keep also in our sights the question of how much we tax as profit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sir George Young)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Durham, North-West said that the clause was simple and straightforward; she was right—it is small and perfectly formed—and, in her remarks, I detected no onslaught on the philosophy behind the clause. She wanted us to set out our overall philosophy, which I shall do briefly, before I answer some of her specific questions about the treatment of dividends and capital allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield who, like me, is thinly capitalised, rightly said that the rate of corporation tax was a sort of barometer; a signal that the UK sends out about our approach to wealth creation. I think he saw an article in today's press, which I also saw, which stated that the rate in several Scandinavian countries had dropped below the rate in the UK. He was right to say that we should keep an eye on that. The rate in Germany is 59 per cent. In Italy and Japan, it is 52 per cent., compared with our rate of 33 per cent. There is a clear margin between the UK and some of our major competitors but we must not be complacent. My hon. Friend also, rightly, made the point that what matters is not only the rate of tax but how it is calculated.

There are two key tests of a tax regime. First, does it yield adequate revenue? Secondly, does it do so with minimum adverse impact on the economy? Our corporation tax policies have been proved correct on both

counts. If one considers the yield, corporation tax is expected to rise from £14.9 billion in 1993–94 to £20.1 billion in 1994–95, and to continue rising to around £26.4 billion in 1995–96, representing 10 per cent, of total Government receipts.

Those rising tax yields do not represent a burdensome impact on businesses and do not eat into the competitiveness of the UK economy. On the contrary, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield mentioned, our corporation taxes have been and remain among the lowest in the world. Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland have lower rates. According to my information, everywhere else has higher rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result of our policies is that the economic recovery is now being reflected fully in rising profitability and improving financial health in the corporate sector. Let us examine some indicators of that economic recovery. The profits of industrial companies rose by 16 per cent, in the year to the third quarter of last year; their financial surplus is now at record levels; corporate indebtedness has fallen steadily since 1991; and the CBI survey shows a sustained high level of corporate optimism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Corporate financial strength forms the basis for a virtuous circle, not only because it brings in worthwhile revenue for the Treasury coffers but because it has removed a constraint on investment. The forecasts lead us to expect investment to increase, not only in fixed capital—which we are forecasting to rise by 11 per cent, this year—but in training, research, design and marketing. That investment will serve to expand the economy's capacity to meet rising demand at home and abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an overall philosophy, we want a broad-based, low-rate tax regime, which we believe is the key to helping revenue yields. We have had such a regime in place since the structural reform of corporation tax in the mid-1980s. It is a successful regime that we do not propose to abandon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked me specific questions about the industrial finance initiative. The taxation of companies and their shareholders was a matter that was discussed in the context of the IFI. A wide range of views and many proposals emerged, for which Treasury Ministers are most grateful. On the specific matter that we are debating today, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor made clear in his Budget statement, we were not persuaded of the need for radical changes in corporation tax in the general regime this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dividend levels are a matter for companies and their shareholders, but we set the framework within which capital markets operate, including the value of tax credits and the rate of advance corporation tax. Those issues were discussed openly during the IFI. There was never going to be a publication, so the question of Lord Hanson censoring it does not arise. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor announced in the Budget, this year there will be no change in the value of the tax credit or the rate of ACT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if one accepts that the current system levies a lower level of tax on profits that are distributed to exempt shareholders than applies to retained profits, I do not think that it is proven that that damages or distorts the economy.
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
High dividends, coupled with the financing of new investment by additional equity issues, subject firms far more directly to the test of the market than if they simply had the incentive to recycle their profits within the company, without the market having an opportunity to pass judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate on capital allowances is a familiar one and I shall not weary the Committee with it. However, if one returned to 100 per cent, first-year capital allowances, there would be a cost—it would reverse the trend that we have introduced of low capital allowances and low tax rates. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, not only would that be expensive but it would be highly distortionary and would not encourage high-quality investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have answered the specific questions that were posed. I do not think that either side of the Committee disputes that we have set the right rates for corporation tax for next year. On that basis, I hope that the clause can stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I suspect that the Committee will not divide on the clause, I should like to make some points for the record, especially about the international comparisons that several members of the Committee have made—
	<i>[Laughter.]</i> Perhaps I had better get something on the record and, I hope, it will be the last reference. The Chief Secretary for the Ritz referred to my Geneva connection. There, I paid a wealth tax; everything in the bank was subject to a withholding tax. I paid a property tax. All my taxation was based regionally and very little went to the centre. As a result, the Swiss tax regime allows money to be raised and kept where it can be best spent. It does not involve the highly centralised regime that is used by the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Countries that have higher levels of corporate taxation are those that perform successfully in the global economy. Germany and Japan were mentioned earlier, as was Italy, which has overtaken Britain in GDP per capita and economic output. A case could be made for re-examining corporate tax and distributive profits and for ways to secure more capital for investment and lower outgoings through rent. Perhaps we should return to those matters later in our sittings. I have much to say, but not tonight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise some of the issues connected with small businesses. The Federation of Small Businesses feels that the Government are creating complexities that should not exist in the taxation regime of small businesses. By leaving the tax on small businesses as it is, and by failing to uprate, the Government have failed to recognise that small businesses could have reached high levels of profit. The matter is incredibly complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
Corporation tax for firms with profits up to £300,000 are taxed at 25 per cent. Companies with profits of between £300,000 and £1.5 million pay tax according to a complex formula, which effectively means that they pay a marginal rate of corporation tax at 35 per cent. The Federation of Small Businesses feels that the regime should be made less complex. It says that while a small, limited company pays 25 per cent, tax, the unincorporated business owner pays a personal rate of 20 per cent, on profits up to £3,200; he pays 25 per cent, up to £24,300; and he pays 40 per cent, on the remainder. There is an additional profits-related tax; class IV national insurance, for which there is no related benefit. The federation does not see why the proprietor of a small business should be taxed at either 20 per cent., 25 per cent, or 40 per cent., but instead that the profits retained in a business should be taxed at the small business rate of 25 per cent, on profits up to £300,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The complex matter should be part of a corporation tax review. The Government have not reviewed the matter and have therefore left complexities that small businesses should not face. The Government have said that they want to encourage small businesses to help them to deal with tax in a more simple way, which is much of what self-assessment involves. Yet, the enormous complexities will not make life any easier for them. The Government keep saying that in nearly two decades little effort has been made to simplify or streamline the system, which is what is required. Why did not the Government raise the threshold at least in line with inflation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As with the previous debate, the Government's philosophy is to try to maintain a low rate of corporation tax for smaller companies. We are proposing a rate of 25 per cent., which compares well with the 1978 rate of 42 per cent. That is a worthwhile reduction for this country's smaller companies and it is one of the lowest rates in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand what the hon. Lady said about simplification. For those small businessmen who are not companies, but who trade in their own right, self-assessment will bring worthwhile simplification and,
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
hopefully, savings. But clause 32 deals with corporation tax for small companies and there will always be a difference between the regime governing smaller companies and that governing those who trade in their own right. It will not always be possible to marry them up, which I think was the thrust of one of the hon. Lady's remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tried in the Budget to ease the burden on smaller firms. Such measures include transitional rate relief, capping increases in the uniform business rate at 10 per cent, for large businesses and 7.5 per cent, for small ones, and cutting employer national insurance contributions by 0.6 per cent, for employees earning less than £205 a week, which will particularly benefit smaller employers. Smaller employers are now allowed to pay their national insurance and PAYE quarterly, and we are consulting on annual accounting periods for VAT. The impact of those measures on small firms can be seen in the encouraging signs of recovery after a difficult recession. A European business survey conducted last month for Grant Thornton showed 59 per cent, of United Kingdom companies enjoying rising profitability and there has been a dramatic increase in self-employment—200,000 more people are self-employed than two years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other measures in the Budget help small companies to access funds such as venture capital trusts and enterprise investment clauses. We shall come on to that subject shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that we have got the regime right. We are keeping one of the lowest rates that we have, we are simplifying and streamlining when we can, and there are other improvements in the pipeline. Of course, we recognise that the representatives of small firms and those who are self-employed would like to see further progress. I hope that we can maintain our dialogue with them, and make that progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
