	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that we were discussing discounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It occurred to me last night that Ministers have not given adequate replies on two points. Conservative Members stated that people entitled to discounts would not fail to claim them because people were not slow to press their own interests. The Minister's response was to talk about checks to ensure that a claim was valid. Some people will genuinely think that they are entitled to a discount when they are not and others will fraudulently attempt to claim a discount. Surely, the Government are not planning to take people's word for it when they claim a discount. What checks will be made to ensure that only those entitled to a discount will receive one? How long will that take? It has already been pointed out that many people are genuine single persons and that a large number of checks will have to be made. That will add to the difficulties of the people who make those checks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have said nothing about how the system will work. They only say that if people are due for a discount, they will claim one. End of story. It cannot be that simple.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and Devon, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree that in the social security system there is a need also to check on the living arrangements of claimants, that that is a road well trodden and that there is nothing novel, peculiar, odd or outré about the proposal? Surely it slips very naturally into modern society?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right to say that such checks are already made in the social security system, but last night she seemed to be objecting to making inquiries into people's circumstances. She seemed to think that that would become too much like the nanny state, with too much interference in people's personal lives. Therefore, it must be accepted that if people ask for a discount, inquiries will be made into their personal lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
I do not regard it as intrusive to ask someone claiming a discount whether it is justified. My objection to the discount is that it is irrelevant to people's real needs. I want to hear from the Minister how the Government will make those checks. They cannot simply use social security records because some single people are so well off that they have never been near the social security offices and have provided for themselves. The Government cannot simply rely on social security records. They must make independent checks. How will that be done? How much will it cost? How long will it take the local authorities to make those checks?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another aspect to that. Last night a claim was reiterated—we have heard it often from Conservative Members—that it is not fair for single people to pay the same bill because they live alone and use fewer local authority services than families. That is an odd argument. For many years it has been said with great validity in local government circles that the rates were not a payment for services rendered, they were, and should be accepted, as a tax. National taxes are not based on a bill for what the Government have done. If they were payments for services rendered, we could all argue about which services we wanted and which we did not, but no Government have accepted that. We pay our share of what the nation needs to run its affairs. In the same way, the local authorities need to raise taxes to run their affairs. The money we pay is not for services rendered. That is a nonsensical argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is developing an important and interesting point. She is pointing up the extreme right-wing doctrinaire nonsense with which we are being confronted by Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland showed his vision of the relationship between the community and the taxpayer as essentially a market-oriented contract-based one, where services were bought from the state or from local government. That is how the Government see things and why they are in such a mess.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin M. Brandon-Bravo 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I heard the hon. Lady correctly. Again, she is questioning the Government's attitude towards single occupancy as compared with larger households. How does the hon. Lady square her criticism of our approach with that of her hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) who said that the Labour party must find a way to get round that problem? If the hon. Lady's Front Bench recognises that problem, what has happened on the Back Benches?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot help the hon. Gentleman unless he spells out exactly which problem my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) talked about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Brightside was talking about the single person household that was not recognised under the old rating system as compared with a household of two, three or four people. His comment is on the record. Will the hon. Lady now square that comment with what she says is the view of her party? There is a difference in views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave it to my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside to expand on his point. I am not psychic, especially after such a long night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is one that is agreed by all Opposition Members. Whether a household is a single person household or otherwise does not negate the point that a tax is not a payment for services rendered. Therefore it is irrelevant to the number of people who live in a household. We are paying a tax for our share in the same way that we pay national tax, which is not a bill for services provided by the Government. If that is logical at Government level, why is it not logical at local authority level?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we break that down and use people's actual living experiences, we see what nonsense it is. There are services such as swimming pools, libraries and bowling greens that are used extensively by some individuals—either persons living on their own or others with young children—or whole families. There is no pattern. Some families will use all of those services and others will use none of them. Single people with leisure at their disposal will never be away from the municipal swimming pools, libraries and so on. Therefore, the logic of the Government's argument breaks down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My simple point is that if it is logical for the Government to impose a tax for an individual's share of the cost of running the country—whether or not the quality of those services is approved and, heaven knows, in recent years taxes have been paid with resentment—why is it not possible to apply the same logic to local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. Papers were left on the desk last night by myself and other hon. Members which have disappeared. Perhaps that is our fault for not taking them to our offices but we were told that the Room would be secured when we left shortly after 2 am. We were told that if we left papers on the desk, as opposed to rubbish on the floor, they would be secure. In my case, the matters I was dealing with last night are ingrained in my memory but it is unfortunate not to be able to refer to notes that were otherwise available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May we be given an assurance that papers left in the Room will be safe? I should be grateful, Sir Michael, if you could pass on to those who have cleared the room that there is a difference between rubbish on the floor and tidy papers on the desk that should not be thrown away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the matter. I was going to refer to it. Unfortunately, early this morning there was confusion as to whether or not the Room should be locked. I can now tell the Committee categorically that during the lunch break, the Room will be locked but it will not be locked overnight. That has a practical purpose because otherwise this Room may be likened to certain undesirable rooms that we have heard about in the past. I express my regret for the confusion, and I hope that hon. Members were not unduly inconvenienced by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I at the same time say that I am sorry that the 
	<i>Hansard</i> record is not up to date. However, I think that all hon. Members will understand the difficulties with which 
	<i>Hansard</i> is wrestling. We are grateful to those in 
	<i>Hansard</i> who are doing their best to keep up to date. If they fall behind a little, I know that they are doing their best to keep us as up to date as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. Opposition Members will not hold 
	<i>Hansard</i> responsible
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
for the absence of any 
	<i>Hansard</i> report of yesterday's proceedings. However, it is worth just putting on the record that this is yet another disadvantage under which the Committee is placed by virtue of the Government's timetable motion. That illustrates again how difficult it is for a Committee to do its job properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may reply to the specific point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe). It is a new point and not one that we focused on in the small hours of this morning. The hon. Lady asked about the checks to be made on fraudulent discount claims. The position is that the responsibility for establishing the validity of claims will lie with local authorities. They will already have some information, for example, from the community charge register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key point is that authorities will grant discounts only if they are satisfied that they are justified in doing so. If a local authority does not consider that it has sufficient evidence, it will not award the discount but simply issue a standard bill. In that case, it will be open to the discount applicant to appeal against the authority's decision. I hope that answers the hon. Lady's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some people in local authorities in Scotland have expressed concern about the checking powers that they will have. Will they be able to make the same demands for information as in the past and a legal right to ask for that information?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will check the details for the hon. Gentleman but in general terms the Bill places a duty upon the liable person to inform the billing or levying authority if there is any change within the household that would result in the cessation of, or a reduction in, the entitlement to discount. There is a civil penalty for non-compliance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members will recall that in the early hours of the morning we were examining the valuation system to be used and the interface between the valuation system and the discount system. We had interesting discussions about the way in which houses that were valued in April 1991, were improved and consequently sold only to be revalued on the improvement element, even if that were 10 years after the original 1991 valuation. That will cause extraordinarily difficult professional, technical and political problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were given a definition of how valuers would operate in assessing the requirements of individual dwellings even though they were not being examined in detail. We were told that this would be done from the air with in-flight valuations. I only repeat that because it seemed like a dream at the time. [HON. MEMBERS: "A nightmare".] We could hardly believe that, but it is undoubtedly on the record. People will have the backs of their houses examined from the air to ascertain whether improvements have been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities (Mr. Michael Portillo)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I merely wanted to point out that a joke has been passed down from the Back Bench. If the hon. Gentleman pauses for a moment, he will be fed the joke and he can pass it across the Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is perhaps significant that the Minister of State is wearing a tie on which the motif is a parachute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is either a parachute, which is highly appropriate, or a hot air balloon. I remember from last night's interesting debate that we discussed the possibility of a hot air balloon passing over the garden. I congratulate the Minister on his astuteness is getting that tie out of his wardrobe. We have a mental picture of a balloonist, a parachutist or even an aeronautics expert passing over our gardens to look at our houses to make the necessary valuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We then passed on to the discount system and discussed how that would cause havoc in the operation of the new council tax and the problems of compiling a register or a list. I drew attention to the Secretary of State for Scotland's contribution on 6 November in c.540. I shall not repeat it as it is so convoluted that it would be difficult to get it right. The upshot was that we were to have a list—even if we were not going to have a register—which would set out who was living in a dwelling and whether they were telling the truth about being a single person household.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We examined the fact that in inner London, as many as 50 per cent, of households are single person households, and also examined the problem of the 1 million people who had been lost to the census because of the poll tax and the fact that that was likely to repeat itself. To use the terminology of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, we shall become a nation of grass widows. A husband will go to the shed at the bottom of the garden to evade having to pay tax as a family as opposed to a single person. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) reminds me that it might well be that those husbands will be spotted from the air. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) reminds me that someone can be spotted through a window from 2,000 ft. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sorry, my hon. Friend said widow not window! I shall certainly give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is the Labour party's heritage of an all-intrusive state that the Conservative party has been trying to push back since it took office? That all-intrustive state is exemplified in the Labour party's fair rates proposal: it is the most unfair and intrusive proposal that any Conservative Member has ever seen. One may look at a house from the back or above, but that would be quadrupled by the four different ways in which the Labour party proposes to value and revalue a property in what would, essentially, be a wholly unfair rates system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party has been accused of many things over the years, but never of aerial photography to ascertain the valuation of, or the number of people in, a dwelling. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is too much background conversation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the remark was that it was a hidden agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the hon. Lady's contribution—I am pleased that she made it at this time of day—our proposals do not involve intrusion, difficulties with the rebate system, definitions of "head of household" or the problems created by people moving house. Ours is a property tax—it is not concerned with the status of individuals living in a
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
property. None of those problems applies to fair rates, but they do apply to the council tax. Whatever administrative ingenuity local government displays, local authorities will be faced with such problems and with the £780 million cost of the discount system. That amount must be found from national and local taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with matters raised last night by the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, who attacked my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) in an intervention. We made it abundantly clear that our system intends to protect those whose income warrants it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) was absolutely right to point out that we are discussing a tax system. A tax system should relate to the ability to pay. It should relate not to people's status—whether they are married, single, divorced or widowed—but to whether they can afford to make their fair contribution to local services. That is the fundamental difference between the two major parties' current tax policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that those who can afford to pay should contribute to the well-being of the community, not only because that is morally right but because it is right for them as individuals. Their future will depend upon the quality of the education of other people's children as well as their own. The quality of people's lives—for example, being able to walk safely on well-lit streets in well-policed communities and to travel safely on public transport—depends on whether they make a fair contribution, according to their means, to sustain local services. No one but a hermit could escape from that, but the council tax perpetuates the underlying philosophy of the poll tax—that individuals should pay for services that they receive rather than contributing to services which are essential to the community, as my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall protect the widow, the retired single person and the retired couple, not in terms of their status but according to their income and ability to pay, by extending the rebate system and by considering how disregards can be better operated by maintaining a good interface between the rebate system and the valuation system. The old rating system could have been made to work by updating the valuation system and changing the relationship between entitlement to rebate and the value of property. That would have made it fairer and more up to date, as described in "Fair Rates". That is our proposal for phases 2 and 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a major misunderstanding about the way in which the old system of entitlement to benefit worked. People could receive a rebate if the rateable value of their property were so high and the income that they received so low that the juxtaposition of those amounts meant that they could not pay their bills. Such people were entitled to a rebate irrespective of the cost of their house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I used to point out that the Duke of Devonshire, had he become impoverished, would have been entitled to a rebate. Under the council tax, he would not have to be impoverished. He would receive a 25 per cent, discount if he happened to be alone—I do not wish to malign him, as I know that he is not often alone. Jacqueline Onassis, should she grace us with her presence, would be entitled to a discount as a widow. That is a farcical way of using other people's money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

People should receive help because they are retired and living alone, as my sister is. Such people on low incomes require special assistance. Our system would achieve that, but the discount system will not. It will cause administrative havoc and grave problems with the electoral registration system. It will lead to the downfall of the tax if we are ever unfortunate enough to have to administer it.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this second day, may I wish you a very warm Welsh welcome to our proceedings, Sir Michael. Had I done so last night, I should have followed the practice of my countrymen and sung that welcome in a traditional Welsh song, "Ar Hyd y Nos" which, as you know, means "All through the night."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
Amendments Nos. 22 to 24 refer to definition. I warn the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment that, although discussions on definition may appear straightforward, I recall the Standing Committee stage of the Environmental Protection Bill two years ago, when some malevolent spirit asked me to move an amendment redefining "dust". I knew nothing about the chemical properties of dust and fortunately, neither did the Minister nor his officials. Consequently, my amendment was immediately agreed to. I thought that I had achieved a legislative triumph, but some three weeks later, after Government scientists had seen the amendment, "dust" was redefined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today I wish to discuss the rather obtuse meaning of "dwelling" and "domestic property". "Domestic property" was defined only a few months ago in the schedule to the Local Government Finance and Valuation Act 1991, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to the following provisions of this Schedule, domestic property is any property which—

	<ol>

	<li>by virtue of the definition of hereditament in section 115(1) of the General Rate Act 1967, would have been a herditament for the purposes of that Act if that Act remained in force; and</li>

	<li>is not for the time being shown or required to be shown in a local non-domestic rating list or a central non-domestic rating list in force for the year beginning on 1st April 1991; and</li>

	<li>is not for the time being exempt from local non-domestic rating for the purposes of Part III of the 1988 Act."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
In terms of definition, that is simplicity itself. But there is a problem, because in clause 3, "domestic property" is no longer regarded as the term by which we can refer to a house. It is now to be referred to as a "dwelling".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night, I looked up the meaning of "dwelling" in the largest Oxford dictionary, but as the House had adjourned and the people in the Library wanted to go home, I could not spend much time on the matter. The dictionary said that a "dwelling" is a place of residence, of accommodation, of habitation or a house. "Property" was defined as a piece of land owned, and "domestic" as of or belonging to the home. There is a subtle difference between those definitions. A "dwelling" refers more accurately to the people rather than to the place. "Property" has an air of goods about it; it refers to something rather than to some people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment. We wish to know whether the change of definition in so short a time from "domestic property" to "dwelling" has some subtle political meaning or whether it is due to legal experts considering "dwelling" a more suitable word than "domestic property".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 23 refers to Crown exemption. What is the significance of the change between the 1991 Act and Bill? What is the relevance of the reference to "Crown exemption" in the Bill and what does it mean?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 24 refers to domestic and non-domestic hereditaments. There was a clear distinction under the old rating system. A shop and a house in the same building were classed differently. Similarly, under the poll tax arrangements, the business part of premises was charged the non-domestic rate and the occupants of the combined shop and house paid the poll tax. Clause 3(3) makes no distinction. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A hereditament which is a composite hereditament…is… a dwelling".</p></blockquote>

Do the domestic and non-domestic elements of composite hereditaments constitute a dwelling that will become subject to council tax?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had I made those brief points last night, my contribution would have been even more soporific than it was this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although we are debating amendments to clause 3,1 hope that the Minister will look at clause 72, the Scottish equivalent, although there are considerable differences between the two clauses. So that the Minister can test his advisers, will he explain why, in the Scottish clause, there is no mention of the words in line 20 on page 2? They read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and in applying paragraphs (b) and (c) above no account shall be taken of any rules as to Crown exemption."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is no grouping of those clauses. I am glad that the hon. Member kept his question short because it may be convenient for my reactions to be slow. However, I hope that the Minister's reply on that point will also be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert Key)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remember the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) causing a stir in the Standing Committee on the Environmental Protection Bill when he asked for a definition of "dust"—I was then serving as a parliamentary private secretary to my right hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Patten). It is unlikely that we shall see a repetition of that episode.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can look the hon. Member for Torfaen in the eye and say that there are no base political motives behind the provision, which is purely technical. It is a genuine attempt to improve the meshing of UBR with the council tax. The amendments are ineffective as there is little in clause 3 that could not equally be achieved by regulations under the schedule to the 1991 Act. When preparing to deal with this group of amendments, I found it simplest to get hold of the schedule, from which the hon. Gentleman quoted, and put it alongside clause 3. Everything then begins to fall into place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall spell out the differences of substance between clause 3(2) to (6) of the Bill and paragraphs 2 to 5 of the schedule to the 1991 Act. Clause 3(2) has at its end a provision to disregard rules as to Crown exemption. It is needed to ensure that Crown property which is non-domestic in nature does not fall to be liable to the council tax by virtue of the fact that it either does not appear in a rating list or is exempt from non-domestic rates. There is nothing sinister in this provision. It simply ensures that only genuinely domestic properties are included. An example—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful. I am sorry that I interrupted the Minister as he was about to give an example. What happens to someone who owns extensive outbuildings which appear to be excluded under the clause but which nevertheless are material to the total value of the occupied property? The dwelling's value also reflects the inhabitant's ability to pay more than a person in a similar dwelling who does not have the benefit of the outbuildings that enhance the value of the property as a whole. Will the hon. Gentleman explain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me the opportunity to explain, but I should like to give my example first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
A good example of a Crown exemption might be a NAAFI shop. It would be subject to Crown exemption although it is clearly not a dwelling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Balmoral?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that point in a moment. If that distinction were not made and we did not specifically exclude Crown exemption, I am sure that hon. Members would understand the problem that would arise. The provision will improve the meshing. As for Balmoral, as far as I am aware, Balmoral is not a NAAFI shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The questions that were asked about yards, gardens, outhouses or other appurtenances are covered in the schedule to the Local Government Finance and Valuation Act 1991, the provisions of which have not changed under the council tax proposal. Clause 3(4) is the same as the schedule to the 1991 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3(3) provides a treatment for composite hereditaments slightly different from that contained in the schedule to the 1991 Act. I make no bones about the reason for the change. It is to make the provisions for non-domestic rating and those for the council tax in respect of composite hereditaments mesh precisely. Without that change, there would be a risk that, in a small number of cases, parts of a property would fail to be taken into account for the purposes of both the council tax and non-domestic rates—for example, a shared bathroom in a house that was occupied by several people. By legal definition, that shared bathroom would not form part of the dwelling, because it was not exclusively used by the people in the room or rooms which were part of the house. It could therefore be argued that it should be business-rated—which, to say the least, would be inconvenient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3(5) allows the Secretary of State to prescribe that, for the purposes of the council tax, a single hereditament may be treated as two or more dwellings or that several hereditaments may be treated as a single dwelling. Some single hereditaments consist of several clearly separate and self-contained houses or flats. In those cases, we wish to provide that each of the separate units should be valued separately and give rise to separate council taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also houses in multiple occupation. Let us consider a university campus in which it may be appropriate to treat several hereditaments as a single dwelling, as was allowed under the General Rate Act 1967. We need to include a discretionary element reflecting the discretion available under the 1967 Act. That feature of clause 3 is not available under the schedule to the 1991 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt whether the amendments would achieve a great deal. I hope that I have cleared up all but one point—the Scottish factor. In their definition of "dwelling", the Scots do not refer to non-domestic rating. Therefore, they do not need the provision on Crown property. It is as simple as that. I hope that I have explained the provisions adequately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister for asking a question that he might have already answered. I am referring to a question that was asked in one of yesterday's debates. There must be a reason why the Bill now refers to "dwelling", when the 1991 Act used the term "domestic property". It represents an even greater change from the definition of property under the General Rate Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked my experts that question only yesterday. I was told that, whereas a dwelling can be called a hereditament, it can also be called a domestic property. It is preferable to use the term "dwelling" in an attempt to bring the law into the latter half of the century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may well be so. If the Minister is saying that the change will not make any difference and that it is simply a more modern term, I am content to accept it. However, I found it odd that the change was made in such a short time without Ministers explaining why. I now accept the Minister's answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a simple answer: we always try to do our best.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister help me with a slightly different matter? Some properties that we would usually define as "dwellings" change use during a year. I shall explain. On islands in the west of Scotland, many houses are used as families' sole residences from October until April. From the beginning of April to the middle of October, the family move out, often into a smaller dwelling attached to the main building, and rent the house as holiday accommodation. How would such properties accord with the Minister's definition of a dwelling house?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am especially grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that point. The answer is simple: if a family moves in and out of two domestic properties, both will be liable for the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. A small dwelling often consists of a single room, and sometimes a bathroom. It would have a different value and would be in a different band from the main house. Would the main house become a commercial property for the five or six months when it was let out and would it be rated accordingly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It becomes a non-domestic property during those months. The hon. Gentleman said that the smaller dwelling might have a bathroom. That is a material point in deciding whether a room or a building is domestic property. Famous—perhaps infamous—cases about beach huts have occurred. It is sometimes difficult to decide whether a room or a building can be used as a dwelling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would second homes owned as holiday houses and, therefore, subject to a 50 per cent, discount, be considered commercial properties if they were let commercially for part of the time but used by the family for the rest of the time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would have been a great pleasure to deal with the amendment at 2 o'clock this morning when the hon. Gentleman might not have been so lively. However, the answer is simple: if the property is available for letting for more than 140 days a year, it is non-domestic. I hope that that satisfies the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister realise that the Committee's proceedings have the potential for developing a film script to rival "Whisky Galore"? The Minister will have to rely on an inspectorate to check all the small dwellings throughout the islands in the west of Scotland and those in the highlands to ensure that people have let out their homes for the minimum period. If the Government do not intend to do that, what do they propose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing has changed. The hon. Lady mentioned a problem that exists in any taxation system. A policing mechanism is inherent in any such system. It was included in the domestic rating system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I represent a constituency that includes many properties similar to those described by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). My hon. Friend will be interested to know that local people in such constituencies are good at reporting things that they believe to be wrong. Any Member of Parliament who represents a large rural area will agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is absolutely right. A local person will be quick to inform on a property owner who is new to the area, but two or three local people together is a totally different matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to intrude on private grief between Scottish Members. That problem has always existed and, no doubt, will continue to exist. The problem of bed-and-breakfast accommodation, which is related to holiday lettings, caused us to consult widely over the past couple of years and led us to change the system to make it more easily enforceable and fairer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a probing amendment. One must look at the Bill to establish the definition of "a dwelling". Subsection (4) of clause 3 refers to a private garage. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (6) below, none of the following property, namely…a private garage which either has a floor area of not more than 25 square metres or is used wholly or mainly for the accommodation of a private motor vehicle" is included in the definition of a private dwelling. But is a bigger private garage used for housing two cars classified as a dwelling?</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The definition is in the Bill. Lines must always be drawn and this one has been drawn at 25 sq m. If the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anything less than 25 sq m will not be included in the definition of a dwelling. Does the Minister suggest, that a garage built away from a property and used only to house motor vehicles will be classed as a dwelling? If that is what he suggests, it is totally different from previous descriptions of a dwelling. A dwelling usually houses people, but the Minister now suggests that motor car accommodation with an area over 25 sq m constitutes a dwelling. Will the Minister clarify what else is classified as a dwelling?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to help the hon. Gentleman. Subsection (4) is subject to subsection (6), which states:

	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
that the new system answers the problem. The Committee should not be burdened with the matter for any longer, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 26, in page 2 line 37, after 'may', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'for the purposes specified in subsection (5A) below'.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 27, in page 2, line 42, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(5A) Subsection (5) above shall have effect for the purposes of prescribing the treatment of the following classes of property—

	<ol>

	<li>dwellings in multiple occupation; and</li>

	<li>dwellings which have been converted to provide separate accommodation for members of the same family.'.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments follow on from the previous group. In fact, some of the points made by the Minister in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) covered the issues raised by these amendments—for instance, houses in multiple occupation. However, the Minister did not refer to hostels. The amendments refer to subsection (5) of clause 3, which interprets the meaning of "dwelling". They probe how the Government intend to determine chargeable dwellings. The point about double garages being included as chargeable dwellings is interesting. Amendment No. 25 would allow subsection (6) to apply. Subsection (6) gives the Secretary of State the almighty power to amend the definition of dwelling or substitute another for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who are charged under the clause for a garage or outbuilding will write to the Secretary of State asking for his interpretation of dwelling. That is how the poll tax legislation started. The Secretary of State will be the one to make the decisions. If subsection (6) is the important one, why is subsection (5) necessary? Subsection (5) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order provide that in such cases as may be prescribed by or determined under the order—

	<ol>

	<li>anything which would (apart from the order) be one dwelling shall be treated as two or more dwellings; and</li>

	<li>anything which would (apart from the order) be two or more dwellings shall be treated as one dwelling."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
Why is that subsection necessary? Subsection 6 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order amend, or substitute another definition for, any definition of 'dwelling'".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (5) is superfluous. Amendment No. 25 would remove it and leave subsection (6). Why have both subsections? The omission of subsection (5) would tidy up the clause, allow the Secretary of State to make orders only under subsection (6) and narrow his almighty powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed the power for two houses in the list to be classed as one dwelling and one dwelling to be classed as two. The Minister should explain further. Halls of residence have been mentioned, but we are mainly considering domestic dwellings. I mentioned the 1988 poll tax legislation, one of the problems of which was the number of directives on local government and local government finance that led to orders being made by the Secretary of State. That created problems for local authorities. Clause 3 is going the same way and will create greater confusion and more problems for local government. The Secretary of State may make orders on various matters that we consider should be discussed by
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
Parliament. Those issues should be analysed to ensure that powers that should be stipulated in one of the schedules are not given to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister cannot accept amendment No. 25, then amendment No. 26 would allow the same principles to be taken into consideration in clause 3.1 refer to dwellings in multiple occupation and dwellings that have been converted to accommodate members of the same family. We all know of cases in our constituencies where additions have been made to houses—granny flats or accommodation built specially for a disabled person. We seek clarification on that issue. As I pointed out yesterday, a disabled person or someone who develops a disability and needs to have alterations made to a property in a band higher than band A would be given a concession; he would be charged in a lower band. However, there is no facility for a person already in the lowest band to receive a rebate. Many hon. Members will have received letters from organisations such as MENCAP which are worried that people in band A who would otherwise be entitled to a concession do not qualify, whereas under the rating system they could have appealed and had their payments reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an injustice. I ask again that the matter be considered. If someone in band A is in need of help, he should be able to claim under the exempt dwelling facility. There is no reference to such a facility for severely disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 27 outlines our worries about how houses in multiple occupation will fit in the chargeable description. The amendment would remove any doubt. We know that there is doubt because the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) asked about two or more students occupying a house that was jointly owned. Under the Bill, if those students were registered they would be exempt from payment, but if one ceased to be a student the dwelling would no longer be in the exempt list and 75 per cent, of the new tax would have to be paid. One student would be entitled to the 25 per cent, discount but the house would then be taken off the exempt list and become subject to the chargeable procedure. We were told by the Minister that a house would continue to be exempt if one of the occupants remained a student. However, his comments must be qualified, because the schedules do not say that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our arguments about houses in multiple occupation also apply to hostels, yet no provision has been made for them. In fact, the consultative document issued by the Department of the Environment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member's comments are relevant to the Bill, but I am finding it difficult to relate them to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would leave out clause 3(5), Sir Michael. The consultative document refers to hostels and houses of multiple occupation. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The consultation paper identifies three possibilities for hostels and houses of multiple occupation (HMOs):

	<ol>

	<li>divide the bill between the number of adults and make each liable …</li>

	<li>make the landlord/owner liable and give them the responsibility for collection with people's rents"—</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
that happened under the community collective procedure —and
	<br><blockquote><p>"c) make some properties liable for non-domestic rating."</p></blockquote>
We have not been told which of those three alternatives the Government propose for houses in multiple occupation, or even for hostels. I ask for that matter to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
clarified. It is significant for the debate today and important for our discussions on the remainder of the Bill. I ask the Minister to respond to paragraph 2.37 in the Department of the Environment's consultative document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention to the fact that the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Chope), when Under-Secretary at the Department of the Environment, accepted that houses in multiple occupation will create a problem for charging procedures. That fact reinforces my request for clarification on the issue of houses in multiple occupation and hostels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as is suggested in the consultation paper, the bill is divided between all the adults in a dwelling, with each responsible to the local authority, how will the local authority keep a check on the number of people who should be paying? How will it keep a check on such people—especially people who move around—if there is no register to ensure that everyone pays what is due?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation paper suggests making some hostels liable for non-domestic rating. How does the Minister view that alternative suggestion, which I understand the Government are considering seriously? We have discussed the definition of dwellings. How will the principle apply if properties such as hostels are completely taken out of domestic rating?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The poll tax Bill included exemptions which caused problems for the Government and which the then Secretary of State for the Environment, the right hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Patten), outlined in a statement to the House. The Government then introduced additional proposals to put right some of the anomalies that were included in the 1988 legislation. We should consider those issues now so that, as a result of the representations that we are making, the Secretary of State, who is not a member of the Committee, will not have to return to the Floor of the House and introduce amendments to change the definition of certain properties. We are entitled to know the position before we proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That many matters of concern arise from clause 3 was demonstrated by my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), who did not anticipate the questions that followed his speech. I therefore ask the Minister to answer my questions now so that we may be clear about the interpretation, in clause 3, of the meaning of dwelling—and about what subsection (6) will entail. That subsection gives the Secretary of State tremendous powers to change any definition of a dwelling if he sees fit to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that we shall have to spend some time on this because we have reopened the debate on students and other aspects, and I assume that it will be in order to range over the whole issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The three amendments have wide-ranging implications and any matters raised by the mover of the amendment should be answered by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be delighted to answer them because they are important. However, perhaps I can put to rest the mind of the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) about subsection (6) by saying that it will be much clearer if the Secretary of State defines what is meant by a dwelling. Subsection (5) is not essential; what it does could be achieved under subsection (6). However, by having a separate power, the definition of dwelling can be made much clearer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
I shall try to range over some of the hon. Gentleman's points before dealing with the amendment. The hon. Gentleman spoke about disabled people who, of course, often need to adapt their homes to take account of their special needs. Clearly, they should not have to pay more tax because of special adaptations to their homes, so we have specified that specially-adapted extra kitchens, bathrooms, lavatories and other fixtures such as lifts will not add to the valuation. When disabled people are on low incomes, they will be able to get rebates up to the full amount of the bill and we shall continue the arrangements for giving special allowances to disabled people so that they qualify for rebates at higher levels of income than other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are mindful of the needs of disabled people. Discussions with disabled groups have already taken place and are continuing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The restatement of the Government's position on financial arrangements for the disabled is most welcome. One matter that perhaps the Minister has not mentioned because it may come up later—I am not saying that he failed to answer the question correctly—is that of a disabled person who, by virtue of the multiplicity of his disabilities, has to live with a carer. Do the Government intend to table amendments that would enable that household to be treated as a single dwelling household and thus allow it to receive the 25 per cent, rebate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a serious point. I reiterate that I cannot give a commitment at this stage, but discussions are continuing. That is a genuine answer, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept it in the spirit in which it is intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had a recent case of a largish family with a 14 or 15-year-old severely mentally handicapped boy who stays at home. They live in a local authority house and the authority has decided that the best way to deal with the problem is to knock two flats into one residence. How would that be covered by this provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would become one dwelling house for the purposes of the tax. If the building work were exclusively to help the disabled person, my understanding is—I shall confirm this later—that such alterations would not add to the value of the property for the purposes of the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, there are considerable complications when a dwelling is altered. Some alterations enhance and increase the value of a property and should be discounted when dealing with people with disabilities. Substantial alterations to cater for people with severe disabilities potentially do not enhance the saleability of the property to anyone without that disability. The Rating (Disabled Persons) Act 1978 was introduced to provide an automatic reduction in such severe circumstances—I underline "severe". In the Minister's discussions with the organisations working for or on behalf of disabled people, will he consider reintroducing similar powers to take account of such circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
confess that the limits are difficult to define because the amendments touch on relevant points in this clause and on other matters that we shall discuss later. I hope that that will be borne in mind, and when we come to later parts of the Bill perhaps hon. Members will remember that this discussion has taken place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have sufficient confidence in the Bill to range widely and I shall do my best to answer the questions from members of the Committee. However, I shall rely upon your good self, Sir Michael, to tell me when I am extending beyond the boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point made by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), it is clearly set out in the consultation paper that we intend to ensure that disabled people do not pay more tax on account of special adaptations to their homes. I am happy to consider proposals for disregarding further rooms or features if they fit into the framework of the valuation exercise. They must be different from what is ordinarily provided for able-bodied people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discussions are still taking place with groups representing disabled people and we shall be interested to hear of any proposals that they may have. I hope that that will satisfy the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear that my hon. Friend has invited these organisations to discuss with him such important matters as additional rooms, the adaptation of existing rooms, and larger rooms to accommodate people with disabilities. Does he agree that it is a little rich that the Opposition have raised the matter, considering that the first amendment that we discussed on the Bill was an amendment from the Labour party to take our schedule 1, which allows people with various disabilities, including severe mental impairment, to be disregarded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, but I do not want to disrupt the calm that has descended on the Committee after our late sitting last night, so I shall not continue down that line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the question of the students. As most students cannot get social security benefit, we have made special arrangements for them. I can tell the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) that student halls of residence and student hostels will be exempt. Houses and flats where all the residents are students will be exempt. Students living alone will not have to pay. If students choose to share with others who are not students, they will decide among themselves how to share the household bill, but their presence will not add to the bill. If several people share, it is unlikely that a student will be worse off than, for example, under the present community charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I finish this point, as it may answer the question? We have carefully considered the position of mixed households of students and others. If a student moves into a flat with a non-student, the bill will not increase. The non-student will continue to be able to claim benefit. There is, therefore, no justification for exempting such mixed households. To do so would have a curious effect: it would mean that people would suddenly be keen to share their homes with students because that would allow them to avoid the council tax. The idea is nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nevertheless, does the hon. Gentleman agree that if two students were sharing a flat and were,
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
therefore, in an exempt dwelling, and if one of those students gave up his or her course, the liability of the pair of them would move from zero to 75 per cent, of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that the person who ceases to be a student immediately becomes entitled to benefit. The hon. Gentleman may not have considered that. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I refer to all the benefits to which people are entitled, up to 100 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Minister that if a person becomes unemployed and is not considered by the unemployment benefit office to qualify for benefit, he gets nothing—no unemployment benefit, no supplementary benefit. It depends on the circumstances of the individual. The Minister is trying to tell us that everything is all right for such people, but it is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not challenging this legislation—he is challenging other legislation, which is perhaps a little wide of the mark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a slightly technical point which has been raised with me by assessors in Scotland. The Minister keeps using the term "exempt" with reference to university halls of residence. That is not exactly true. The hall of residence will be exempt from the council tax, but under the Scottish legislation the building will be transferred to non-domestic rating and the university will pay a rate on that building. Presumably, the university will pass the tax on by way of the rent charged to the students. If the Minister says that that is not so, will he tell us what will happen when the hall of residence is used for commercial purposes by the university during summer recesses, and so on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman was referring to one of the earlier proposals that was discussed. I am relieved to be able to tell him that he is not correct. When a hall of residence is used for a portion of the year for non-student purposes it will qualify for business rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend allow me to underline the point? Any such UBR will be rechargeable to commercial users of such premises; none of it will come on to students' bills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be clear what the amendments mean. Amendment No. 25 would completely omit clause 3(5). That subsection enables the Secretary of State to prescribe that what might otherwise be a single dwelling shall be treated as two or more dwellings and, similarly, what might otherwise be two or more dwellings shall be treated as a single dwelling. Under the amendment, the definition of a dwelling would be linked inextricably to that of a hereditament for rating purposes. Hereditament does not always represent a natural unit of occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might not be high politics, but it is a very interesting and important part of our heritage that a single hereditament may include several dwellings. Subsection (5) is an attempt to clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 restrict clause 3(5) to the two classes of property specified in new clause 3(5A): homes in multiple occupation, and dwellings that have been converted to provide separate accommodation for members of the same family. The problem with the amendments is that they would restrict, not enhance, the arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already explained the purpose of clause 3(5). It is needed so that a hereditament which includes several
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>
clearly defined houses, flats or other units can be treated as several separate dwellings for council tax purposes. Where appropriate, such as in the case of houses in multiple occupation, several hereditaments can be treated as a single dwelling for council tax purposes. There is no need to limit the provisions in the way suggested in amendments Nos. 26 and 27.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The House will have an opportunity to consider the way in which the powers provided by clause 3(5) are exercised when the relevant order is laid before it. The order will detail the circumstances in which dwellings will be combined or divided for council tax purposes. Should the hon. Member for Normanton consider that the terms of the order warrant it, the Opposition could seek a debate on it. I should think that that is safeguard enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not pretend that the order will be confined to the classes specified in amendment No. 27, but I shall say what we intend to achieve when exercising the power conferred under clause 3(5). We wish to ensure that the residents of every separate and self-contained house or flat are subject to the council tax in their own right. That is only fair. It would not be fair if, due to an accident of history, three houses that happen to comprise a single hereditament were subject to a single, shared council tax bill, but an identical house nearby—itself a hereditament—were subject to a different council tax bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want all properties in an area of similar value to face a similar council tax bill. That will help to make the council tax fair and understandable. Conversely, there are some cases, such as houses in multiple occupation, where the individual residents should not have to face separate bills even though the definition of a hereditament under the General Rate Act 1967 might suggest that they should. Section 24 of the 1967 Act made provision for hereditaments to be combined in certain circumstances. It is our intention to use clause 3(5) to continue that treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 25 would restrict the Secretary of State's ability to achieve fair and comprehensible treatment of certain types of dwelling, and I hope that the Committee will reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister used the word "hereditament" seven times in his reply. Yet nowhere in the Bill or consultative document are hereditaments referred to, because that term has a significant meaning for valuation purposes. I ask the Minister, although I do not expect an answer immediately, to give some examples of cases in which a number of hereditaments will form a dwelling under the Bill. When the Inland Revenue looks at hereditaments, it is usually looking at domestic properties for occupation by families. If the Minister is saying that hostels are classed as hereditaments, will they continue as dwellings chargeable under the Bill, or will they come under the unified business rate? I asked the Minister in the debate on the consultation paper to address the points about hostels and other forms of multiple occupation, but we have not been given the answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern. He is right to press the Government on those details. They

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is unfortunate because the legislation will have far-reaching effects on local government. The details may be covered later by regulations, but, as I said earlier, one of the failures of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 was the regulations. I fear that the same will happen with this Bill. The people who will suffer are those who rely on local government services for which finance is important. The Bill will follow the same track as the poll tax Bill. People will suffer because questions put by the Opposition have not been answered by the Government. That is disappointing, to say the least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that poor disabled people will receive consideration. He said that disabled people, depending on their incomes, will receive rebates. That means that they will have to be on income support or on very low incomes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is misquoting me grossly. I said, and I shall repeat it word for word, that we shall continue the arrangements whereby disabled people get special allowances so that they qualify for rebates at higher levels of income than other people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To qualify for rebates under the council tax people have to be on low incomes or on income support. That is what we have been told. I asked that special consideration be given to severely disabled people. If disabled people will qualify for rebates as other people will, that will not be good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a family is living in a property in band A and someone in that family develops a severe disability and adaptions have to be made to the property there is no mechanism for them to have their payment reduced by moving the property to a lower band, as there would be if the family lived in a property in band C, D or E. I appreciate that discussions are continuing between the Minister, his advisers and organisations representing the disabled. I ask the Government carefully to consider the case of a family in these circumstances in band A and to provide a way in which such families could be taken out of the banding system completely if they have to adapt their houses to cope with a severe disability.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 51, in page 3, line 6, after second 'dwelling', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'set out in subsection (2A) below and any other dwelling'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 52, in page 3, line 7, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) Any property will be exempt if the following criteria apply:

	<ol>

	<li>it is unoccupied property with respect to which less than 12 months have elapsed since the day on which it was last occupied; and</li>

	<li>it is owned by a person to whom paragraphs (1), (6), (7) or (9) of Schedule 9 to this Act apply; and</li>

	<li>he had his sole or main residence in the property immediately before he acquired his sole or main residence as specified under paragraphs (6), (7) or (9) of that Schedule or was detained as mentioned in paragraph (1) of that Schedule (as the case may be).'.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to elucidate some aspects of the Government's thinking about the likely application of clause 4. Clause 4 deals with properties that will be exempt from council tax, but the clause tells us little about how decisions will be made and how categories of property will be identified. The purpose of the amendment and some amendments in the next group is to probe the Government's mind on how they intend to use the widely drawn powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendments Nos. 51 and 52 would be to exempt prisoners, detainees, hospital patients, those in residential care and care workers from liability to pay council tax on properties which they own but which had been unoccupied for less than 12 months. The amendments probe whether the Government intend in the exercise of the power to repeat and preserve the position established under the Local Government Finance Act 1988. That Act specified classes of property to which a multiplier of zero should be applied and which would, therefore, be exempt. Included in that category were
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
properties owned by prisoners, detainees, hospital patients, those in residential care and care workers where they were unoccupied without limit of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, concessions were made to those groups on the ground that it would be unreasonable or unfeeling to expect payment of the standard community charge to be made by the people in them. However, nowhere in the Bill is there mention of the types of property that might be exempt under this provision. Consequently, maintenance of the earlier concessions is in doubt because there is no sign from the Government in the Bill that they intend to preserve them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government accept the amendment or another very much like it, we should at least clarify that position, but if they do not, we will be forced to draw one of two conclusions. One conclusion is that the Government intend not to maintain that concession but to withdraw a provision that had been available under the poll tax legislation. That would be widely regarded as grossly unfair. For example, it would mean that many of those least able to fend for themselves financially would face a liability that they could not hope to meet. Prisoners and detainees unable to discharge their liabilities, ineligible for benefit and able to earn only a few pounds a week would, upon release, almost immediately be returned to prison because they could not pay their council tax bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those in long-term hospital care would discover that they, too, would fall victim to the enforcement process which would follow non-payment at a time when their health was least able to stand it. Those in residential homes often rely on relatives or the state to pay their fees, and they would be unable to discharge their liabilities from the few pounds a week allowed to them for their personal spending. Those providing care on a residential basis, whose personal and financial sacrifice for the community is already large, would have to discharge their liabilities by making even greater sacrifices and by giving up their care work for properly paid work. I cannot believe that the Government intend to create such a position, so I prefer to conclude from any rejection of the amendment that they are minded not to withdraw the concession but, perhaps, to extend it. I hope that they intend to continue the current system of exemptions or even to extend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the case, I assume that the Government are willing to say that they intend to maintain those concessions and might even be prepared to extend them. Presumably, they will also be prepared to state that they will not introduce time limits for dwellings previously occupied and owned by particular classes of people where none exists at present. It would be extremely interesting to know, for example, whether student nurses and apprentices are to be included in those exemptions and what time limits, if any, might be applied to those new classes of exemptions. Such a statement by the Minister would go a long way towards allaying the fears of those who suspect that the Bill may be used as a cover under which to claw back some of the concessions forced upon the Government in a vain attempt to make the poll tax more palatable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is that if the Government are unwilling to state their reasons for rejecting the amendment, their intentions will be made clear. I hope that the Minister can reassure both Opposition Members and a much wider public outside the Committee that the Government are not attempting, under the vagueness of the provisions of clause
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
4, to do away with an extremely valuable and worthwhile concession but that they intend to maintain and even extend it. I look forward to hearing the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a brief point to make. When the poll tax legislation was being debated, the Opposition finally persuaded the Government to recognise the needs of nuns living in convents who are, after all, a community of adults sharing a household. I made the point that they had taken vows of poverty and were obviously not in the same position as a normal collection of persons in a household. What are the Government's intentions in that regard in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Nicholas Bennett)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 deal with the power in clause 4 to exempt certain types of dwelling from payments of the council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 51, moved by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), exempts all those dwellings which are subject to the criteria listed in new subsection (2A) proposed by amendment No. 52 and empowers my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to exempt other dwellings by order. The criteria imposed by amendment No. 52 are that dwellings will be exempt if they have been unoccupied for less than 12 months and are owned by some of the groups of people currently included in schedule 1, who give rise to discounts. I assume that the hon. Gentleman means schedule 1. His amendment says schedule 9, which would be nonsense—it is obviously a typing error—so the amendment would be rejected on technical grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Gentleman that, even if they were technically correct, his amendments are unnecessary. Dwellings which were previously the sole or main residence of the people in the groups listed—prisoners, hospital patients, patients in homes and people providing care—currently benefit from a standard community charge multiplier of zero. That is, they are exempt from the community charges. I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks. I am pleased to tell the Committee that we intend to exempt from the council tax all those dwellings that are subject to a zero standard community charge multiplier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in some difficulty, Sir Michael, so I hope that you will be reasonably indulgent. English clause 4 contains a clear definition of an exempt dwelling, but no such reference appears in the equivalent Scottish clause—far from it, the reverse is true. In the Scottish clause, from the way I and other experts read it, any property that ceases to be defined as a dwelling will go on to the valuation roll and will then become part of the non-domestic taxation system and will be taxed accordingly. Can the Minister explain that difference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman. He will appreciate that I do not deal with Scottish legislation. I shall seek further advice on that matter and if I may, come back to him because another series of amendments to the clause is coming up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments should be rejected for one further reason. They propose exemption only where dwellings have been unoccupied for less than 12 months. However, the groups listed currently benefit from an unlimited
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
period of exemption. That will continue under the council tax. It is clear that our proposals are less restrictive than those of the hon. Gentleman. I therefore ask him to withdraw the amendment. Student nurses will be dealt with in the next group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. As I said, the purpose of the amendments was to probe and I am glad to say that we have successfully probed. I am very satisfied with the Minister's response, which will reassure many people outside the Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before we go further I shall make one or two points on matters that were raised earlier. First, with regard to the dinner break, in view of the wholehearted approval of the Committee, I felt that I had been very generous in giving two hours for dinner yesterday. I shall now return to my more normal thoughts on the matter, so, all things being equal, I ask the Committee to rise at 7.30 pm and come back at 8.45 pm. In case any hon. Member has not succeeded in getting a cup of coffee, we shall adjourn for 15 minutes at 10.15 pm until 10.30 pm. I hope that that will also help the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another matter. Unfortunately, I believe that one or two Committee members were locked out at the previous Division. I should explain that the Chair has the complete discretion about how long to wait before the doors are locked in any Division; that must always be so. If I know that other Committees are sitting, which makes Members temporarily absent, I take that factor into account. Equally, if I consider that everyone is ready and waiting to vote, I look at the Whips to see whether I receive a sympathetic nod. One thing that I will not do is to look around to see whether they are fully satisfied that all their members are there. It is for me to decide the appropriate time to call for doors to be locked; that must remain sacrosanct. Obviously, I shall do my best to allow reasonable time, but that must be at my discretion. Otherwise things can go very wrong; I have known such cases. That is the position and I hope that it is clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

</ol></p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments is designed to serve much the same purpose as the previous group and I hope that it will produce a similarly satisfactory outcome. The amendments deal with virtually the same point, but cover a rather different group of people. Through the amendments, we invite the Minister and the Government to elucidate their intentions on the broad powers in clause 4 for designating certain types of properties and dwellings as exempt dwellings. In particular, amendments Nos. 28, 29 and 30 cover the relevant residences of absent carers, those with the benefit of unused tied accommodation, students, apprentices, student nurses, prisoners and detainees, people in permanent care and, in certain circumstances, those with an additional residence by virtue of its unsalability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are permissive in that, if accepted, they would not require the Government to exempt dwellings in each of those cases, but they would make it clear that the Government have taken that power in the legislation if they wished to use it. My purpose is to probe the Minister's intentions to establish whether Ministers are prepared, at any rate in the first instance, to fulfil two promises which they have already given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first promise was that contained in the White Paper to the effect that where homes are exempt from the personal community charge, they should not receive a higher bill when the household is empty and subject to a standard charge with a multiplier of zero. The second commitment was to extend to other categories, such as student nurses and apprentices, the exemptions which others already enjoy. I need not labour the point that there
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
is a powerful case in respect of almost all of those categories for exempting the residents of such properties from liability for the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify the point about unsalability? Does he propose that there should be a price range in which a house should be advertised during such a period? Otherwise, I can envisage an enormous loophole; a person could simply put his house on the market at five times its value and could then say, "Oh dear. I have been unable to sell it."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be right. When framing the regulations that would no doubt be required under clause 4, such a factor might have to be taken into account. I suspect that when I briefly argue the case for such an exemption, as I shall do, the hon. Gentleman might sympathise with my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I wish to consider students. Those in full-time training survive on very little income. I know from my own 21-year-old daughter how much of a struggle it is. It is extremely difficult for such people—often reliant on the generosity of parents, or having to avail themselves of the Government loan scheme—to find the resources necessary to meet financial obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Prisoners and detainees, whose earning power is obviously very limited, come into a different category. Non-payment for them could lead to a further term of imprisonment, which would be both regrettable and unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for absent residents is based less on their means than on the injustice of levying a standard charge. Those who care for others on a residential basis or who are themselves cared for on a residential basis—either in hospital or residencies—are worthy of exemption on compassionate grounds. The Government would hardly endear themselves to the public if they decided to pursue for payment in respect of residencies in another part of the country those who are in long-term hospitals, who are spending their final years in nursing homes or who are severely mentally impaired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be equally unjust to require victims of the Government's disastrous manipulation of the housing market who are left with two homes to pay a standard charge on their second, unwanted and unsaleable home, which represents a substantial financial burden. For those reasons, I hope that the Minister will surprise and delight the Committee by confirming that he will use the powers under the clause to deal with such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have left the vexed question of student nurses to the end. We have received some briefing material from the Royal College of Nursing, which makes a powerful case. The college is anxious, notwithstanding the Government's promise to do something for student nurses, that a potentially vexatious distinction between different categories of student nurses will be created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment No. 30 is to bring all nursing students, irrespective of what course they are pursuing, into the same category for exemption purposes. If the Minister does not provide proper answers, we shall press the amendment to a Division. The amendment covers only a small number of nursing students, which would in any case decrease over time, so it is not as if we are asking the Government to be too generous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As most members of the Committee know, nursing education is undergoing substantial reform. New courses are being offered under a scheme known as Project 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
Ultimately, all nurses will be educated under that scheme, ending the old system whereby nursing students were nominally employees of the national health service. The main difference between the two is that Project 2000 students are financed through a non-means-tested bursary, so that students are more akin to higher education students than NHS employees. In contrast, students on existing courses outside Project 2000 are financed through a training allowance, and are counted as NHS employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the end of 1992, all nursing students in Scotland and Wales will be within the Project 2000 scheme: in England, Project 2000 is part-way through implementation and both types of course exist side by side. The problem with the current position, and, if our fears are realised, with the distinction that the Government are proposing to extend under the Bill, is that only nursing students on Project 2000 will be eligible for exemption, although all nursing students may well be eligible for discount—we shall discuss that later. The difference in treatment creates considerable bitterness, unhappiness and resentment among nursing students. They believe, with good reason, that there is no logical basis for distinguishing the two categories, and that if they happen not to qualify for exemption, they are being discriminated against for no good reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons the Government would please the nursing world, and establish themselves as being concerned with fairness and equity, if they said that they intended to use the powers in clause 4 to extend the provisions about exempt dwellings to all student nurses, irrespective of the courses that nurses happen to pursue. A powerful argument for such an extension is that the Government would thereby reduce the complexity of the matter. We discussed earlier the problems of dwellings that are occupied variously, on different days by combinations of students and non-students. We should, if possible, avoid having to consider such complex matters as whether a flat or household contains nursing students who are taking different courses. I can hardly believe that the Government would decide, for example, that three nursing students—two of whom were on Project 2000 and one of whom was not—who shared a flat should all be excluded from the exemption provisions. Such an exclusion could be based only on an extraordinarily small and technical distinction. Whatever concessions that the Government decide to make, I hope that they will bear our arguments in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The group of amendments includes amendments Nos. 29, 74 and 53, which the hon. Gentleman has not discussed. Is he going to refer to them? I shall interrelate them in my reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said what I want to say about the amendments. Unless any of my hon. Friends want to discuss the amendments—I am sure that they will show their desire to do so—it would be helpful if the Minister would now comment on the amendments. However, if we are not satisfied with his comments on amendment No. 30, we may call for a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bellotti 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to amendment No. 74, which stands in my name. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
Committee should consider carefully the points that have been made about students and student nurses. The Bill should leave the Committee containing no ambiguities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Second Reading debate, the Minister made clear his view of the Bill's effect on students. I assume that he genuinely stated his intention when he said that students should not pay; the point was welcomed by the whole House. The Committee must translate that view into action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several amendments have been suggested. Although I am happy to support the other amendments in the group, they are almost as deficient as the Bill itself. The starting point of the amendments is the property, not the point where we should start—the student or student nurse, all of whom should be exempt, wherever they live. Amendment No. 74 would include
	<br><blockquote><p>"the need to exempt all those undertaking education and training such as students and student nurses, regardless of where they live".</p></blockquote>
Clearly, after 1993, when the Bill has been implemented, disputes will arise over multi-occupancy dwellings and local authorities will have to make judgments on whether a whole property is subject to council tax. Amendment No. 74 would help those local authorities because it cannot be stated more clearly that, regardless of where they live, students and student nurses will be exempt. The Labour amendments would improve the position but do not go far enough and Labour Members should support our amendment because it would leave no doubt about the purpose of the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be enormous problems with the mixed housing that students and student nurses occupy. We want to provide a cast-iron guarantee, which amendment No. 74 would provide, that they will not have to pay. It is unnecessary to repeat all the reasons why it is important to exempt students except to say that they have neither the means nor the ability to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) clearly outlined the position of student nurses and I am sure that all members of the Committee want to help them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all understand what we mean when we refer to student nurses, but I am worried about the all-embracing phrase, "all those undertaking education." Many mature students make substantial sacrifice to return to education but that is not so of all mature students. Many adults take local authority part-time courses, some of which are non-vocational. The all-embracing phrase, "all those undertaking education" would produce many pitfalls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that comment. The amendment would apply to clause 4(3), which refers to 	<br><blockquote><p>"such factors as the Secretary of State sees fit."</p></blockquote>
The amendment is an illumination of the sort of factors which the Secretary of State would see fit. The amendment is no more ambiguous that the clause in its reference to students and student nurses because it would stand with the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am replying to the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney). I am disappointed that the hon. Gentleman has raised the sort of matter that will have to be considered with any property-based system. I would much prefer a system which is related to ability to pay and based on income, but as we are not to have such as system, we must ensure that every student and student nurse is exempt from the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a former Open university student, I feel sure that hon. Members will have heard the hon. Gentleman's comments with interest. Will he clarify what he said?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, many students in my constituency are reading for Open university degrees as their only task in life. The hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is another category of student. I take the general point that all of us wish students to be exempted wherever possible, but some students reading for courses at polytechnics and universities are there on a seconded basis from full-time employment, and are usually on full salary. Some of them are of high rank and are earning high salaries. While I should like to exempt all students, I am not that happy about ensuring that such people are exempted from the taxation system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our amendment is a probing amendment, just as amendment No. 29 is a probing amendment. There is a strong onus on the Minister to explain satisfactorily—which he has not yet done—how each student nurse and student will be exempt from council tax. In mixed dwellings, there will be many difficulties about which we have not had an answer. I am convinced that amendment No. 74 is one of the best answers before us. It probes, but we have had no response.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am putting a point to the Minister in the hope of tying him down on this matter. Will he tell us how he can give all students and student nurses a cast-iron guarantee that they will not pay this tax? If not, we shall have to stay here for a long time to ensure that that guarantee is given. None of us wants students and student nurses to be denied relief from this tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's amendment, No. 74, refers to "all those undertaking education". Presumably that includes people attending evening classes, as well as the category that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) mentioned. Will he clarify that? Does he really mean to include all those undertaking education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already answered that point. The amendment relates to clause 4(3) which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"such factors as the Secretary of State sees fit".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is attached to that. It is no more ambiguous than the clause. We seek assurances about how
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
the Minister intends to give students a cast-iron guarantee. I am not satisfied that I have heard from the Minister, either on Second Reading or in Committee, that that guarantee is in place. If it is, I need not press the amendment but, if it is not, I might take a different view on a series of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the past 10 years, 100 local government Acts have been introduced. Putting the amendment in context, I recall that on 2 February 1989, the right hon. Member for Cirencaster and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) said when introducing the Local Government and Housing Bill that it would complete the essential reforms within which framework local authorities would operate. However, there are now amendments to the heart of local government expenditure and funding in respect of rebates and exemptions for categories of people who may be required to contribute towards the council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, I spent a long time putting forward the Royal College of Nursing's case. The Government's position was ambiguous. The statement of the Secretary of State for Wales at the end of the debate and further questioning from myself showed the Government's position in detail. There is much anger and frustration among those who work for the national health service, and the Secretary of State's remarks confirmed the profession's worst fears—that the Government are introducing a two-tier system for nurses.

As my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said, the amendment is about giving equal status to nurses in training, irrespective of how they have come into the training system—either through the district health authority or through the new Project 2000 courses. The amendment is not an attempt to bust the Government's proposals either in principle or in practice. We would all accept that we are dealing with a transitional period leading towards the time when all nurses will be training through Project 2000. Therefore, we are attempting to iron out anomalies, which will inevitably be exposed when all nurses are so trained. The financial amounts involved are minuscule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, because we are in a phasing-in transitional period, our proposals would not undermine the Government's thrust in attempting to separate those who can be classified clearly as students from those who can be classified differently in other training projects—for example, those who were previously classified in industry as apprentices. The nurses are in a unique situation. They could be dealt with as a group of people in a way that would not undermine the Government's philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will treat the amendment in the way that it is intended: it is just about clearing up an anomaly. The Government have already conceded 100 per cent, rebates in certain circumstances. They are also ready to have full discussions with the disabled about classification of exemptions for their carers and about banding arrangements for the property of the disabled. The amendment should be seen in the same light. It is an

	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
attempt to improve the Bill without throwing up anomalies that make the system unfair. Unfairness affects the public perception of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tongue-in-cheek last night. I was critical of my colleagues over amendment No. 18, which appeared to give the Government some assistance. This amendment also gives the Government some assistance. If it is not acceptable, the Government should at least give a commitment to return to the problem later and implement what the amendment tries to do. If they did, they would meet total public support, without undermining—as I have said—their attempt to separate out different groups of people in training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal College of Nursing represents 300,000 nurses in the national health service. It is a non-party political organisation. Conservative Members cannot say that the amendment is an attempt by the Confederation of Health Service Employees or the National Union of Public Employees to embarrass or undermine the Government. In fact, the royal college commands a broad spectrum of support across the Committee because of its important role in the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The organisation welcomed the abolition of the poll tax; but on Second Reading we expressed concern that this drafting mistake—I am being kind to the Government— means that the nurses on Project 2000 will be exempt but that other nurses in training for the same type of course, who would work in the wards, study at home and in college and specialise throughout the course, who are identical except for the access point at which they become involved in the NHS as trainee nurses, will not be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking of the door through which the trainee nurse will enter the district hospital to which she will be attached during training. One nurse comes through the district health authority door, another comes through another door that is controlled by the district health authority, which is responsible for the examinations that the trainee nurse will take before being accepted onto Project 2000. We are discussing a technicality. The Government should not become blind and refuse to exempt that category of nurses that my hon. Friend the Member from Dagenham mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 10 November, the Royal College of Nursing was so concerned that it wrote to each Member of Parliament about clause 4, seeking support in asking the Government to amend the Bill during its Committee stage. Its letter stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Royal College is pleased to see that nursing students are mentioned specifically in the Bill in the context of council tax discounts (schedule 1) and hopes that this arises from a desire to avoid the unfairnesses which currently affect nursing students under the community charge.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Regulations defining the term (student) for the purpose of the community charge distinguish between nursing students pursuing new 'Project 2000' courses and who are in receipt of a bursary and those students pursuing conventional nursing courses, financed by means of a training allowance. The incomes of both groups of nursing students are broadly similar, but under the community charge Project 2000 students pay 20 per cent, of the tax, while others pay 100 per cent."</p></blockquote>
The RCN complains that that anomaly in poll tax legislation has been carried through to the Bill, despite the fact that its removal would hardly undermine the whole concept of Government policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The RCN's letter continued:
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"This extraordinary anomaly has caused resentment and bitterness amongst those students facing community charge bills. The RCN believes that the new council tax offers an opportunity to end such discrimination."</p></blockquote>
On that basis, I raised the RCN's case on Second Reading, during which I asked the Secretary of State for Wales whether he would clarify the Government position and whether, if his clarification confirmed the college's fears, he would confirm in Committee the Government's intention to bring in proposals to end the anomaly. Nothing on today's amendment paper shows that such proposals will be forthcoming. Perhaps the Government, having been caught short by five and a half hours of speech on behalf of the RCN, will show willingness to accept the amendment or promise to return later with proposals that would give effect to the amendment. The Minister smiles in his usual beguiling way, but still he refuses my advances and will not rise to speak. I warn my hon. Friends that I shall continue a little longer in the hope of teasing him up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Royal College of Nursing and student nurses are angry that the Government are creating an anomaly for obscure ideological reasons. Everyone agrees that as we approach the year 2000 it is necessary radically to change the way in which student education in the national health service is provided—to widen the opportunities to participate in nursing training, to widen the range of skills to take account of new technology in health care and to ensure that nursing training provides a more skilful and broadly based education for nurses. That goal was set by the Secretary of State for Health, but the Secretary of State for the Environment chose to treat nurses differently in the Bill. We want the opposite. Nurses work together, regardless of whether they enter nursing through Project 2000 or are employed by district health authorities. They should all be eligible for discounts, but only Project 2000 students are eligible for exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference in treatment for different groups of nursing students perpetuates the disparities in the poll tax legislation and is unacceptable to the Royal College of Nursing. Most liberal Members of Parliament with any sense of duty to the nursing profession want the matter to be dealt with fairly and equitably and want the provision amended. If my party were in Government—I have only a few months to wait for that—I should be extremely angry if a Labour Minister introduced such a provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in the amendment would undermine the principle of the Bill or the exemptions. The provision merely obscures the Government's intention of helping students and the public perception will continue to be that the Government are unfair to vulnerable groups. Nursing students are such a group. Perhaps Conservative Back Benchers will use their influence to ensure that an amendment is made to improve the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to give the financial comparisons between the different groups. Nurses who enter a course through district health authorities—the Government refer to such student nurses as employees—receive an annual income of £6,440 per annum, they work an average of 37-5 hours a week in the classroom and on the wards and their income after income tax and other deductions is £96·83. Project 2000 nurses receive an annual income of £4,320, they work an average of 45 weeks a term and their weekly income is £96. Those on a degree course receive £2,845 per annum with a weekly income after tax and other deductions of £94·83. Those figures were provided by the Royal College of Nursing.
