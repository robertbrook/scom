	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly sum up what I was trying to say on Thursday last? I think I have taken the entire Committee most of the way with me on the basis that a reform of local government requires that there should be no political remoteness at least between the electorate and the councillor. I endeavoured to show that under the existing system, with its multiplicity of local authorities, which we have inherited in a patchwork way over the centuries, there could still be remoteness—a lack of communication between the electorate and between the councillors. In a sense, neither the unitary system nor the present proposals set out to remedy this particular basis, with the proviso that in the Maud proposals the community councils were a reasonable basis for complaints and awareness, and in that sense went some way to provide communication between the electorate and their local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I had also taken the point of view that while there are those who complain of geographical remoteness in the Maud proposals, and the unitary system, there are occasions—some of hon. Friends have mentioned them—when there is as much, if not more, remoteness in the present proposals. However, while I disapprove of geographical remoteness, it is not as important as political remoteness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the basis of my argument last Thursday. I should, however, like to mention one final point—a final method of evaluating all these factors. Do we believe that an all-purpose authority, with all services under its control, is more likely to serve the community, the local electorate and local interests, than a multiplicity of authorities where powers are divided and unclear, where the functions are divided and not clear, and where the authorities themselves are diverse and do not, as far as the ordinary individual is concerned, possess the clean logic that a unitary authority would possess?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reform of local government is one of those ideas that everyone in theory supports, provided that the lash falls on someone else's back. I have great sympathy with all those who wish to reform local government, even though I strongly oppose the principles set out in the Bill. Considerable courage has been shown in making the attempt. However, I wonder whether, having decided that there is to be a gigantic reform of loval govern-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
ment—a reform which, as the Minister told us, even the printers find difficult to assimilate, let alone the rest of us—it would not simply have been more in the interests of efficient local government and of local democracy to have gone the whole way and followed Maud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brynmor John</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree with only one point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) during the course of his very remarkable speech. He said that we were all here because we are interested in local government. I think that He was rash to make that assumption on behalf of the silent majority opposite, and that he was also somewhat misguided in assuming it on behalf of hon. Members on this side of the Committee. We in this country are interested in government, not necessarily local government. As I see it, the argument between the unitary and the two-tier system is that to a certain extent we are still constrained by the terms of reference imposed upon us by the reorganisation of local government in the last century. Whether we adopt a two-tier system or a unitary system, it is still, recognisably, a variant of the system of governing our localities which was laid down in 19th century legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I found dispiriting about the Minister's bland dismissal of all the unitary arguments put forward by my right hon. Friend was that it quite simply prejudges the most effective way of governing this country at local level in the foreseeable future in the period which is to be covered by the operation of this Measure. I should like to refer the Minister to an essential prerequisite of the unitary system laid down on page 109 of the Redcliffe-Maud Report, where reference is made to
	<br><blockquote><p>"our reasons for considering that the province is an essential element in the new structure."</p></blockquote>
In other words, we should look at the unitary authority not in isolation but as a tier of government accompanied by provincial government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will know that there is, and has been for some considerable time, a Royal Commission sitting to consider that question. Given that we are trying to lay down a lasting reorganisation of local government in the Bill, have we the right to dismiss any tier of government or any organisation of government at local level
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
before we have seen the proposals of the Crowther Commission for the reorganisation of provincial or regional government—whatever one may wish to call it—that tier of government which is larger than purely local and which will be reported on next year? I believe that we have no such right, and I hope the Minister will not, therefore, have a closed mind to the desirability or otherwise of unitary authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister of State at the Welsh Office will know, this question has been raised in a Welsh context on a number of occasions. He has briefly sought to show that because my right hon. Friend the Member for Huyton (Mr. Harold Wilson) said three years ago that there was no need to hold up local government reform until the report of the Crowther Commission, that is therefore conclusive of the matter. Of course, it is not because time is everything. The analogy I gave in the Welsh Grand Committee was: one takes more trouble to hurry for a bus if one knows there is not another bus for an hour than if one knows another bus will be along in two minutes' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, what we are doing now in 1971, is to pre-judge the Crowther Commission Report by no more than a few months. Therefore, in our haste to push through any measure of reorganisation, we may be pushing through the wrong measure, because it is quite clear that the Royal Commission—I hasten to add, the Welsh Royal Commission—in analysing this position, says that boundaries cannot reasonably be divorced from functions or from finance. That, quite simply, is the problem here. Until it is known what functions a provincial council will have, until it is known what functions will therefore reside in the local authorities, the boundaries which the local authorities ought to have cannot possibly be known nor can it be known whether they ought to be organised on a unitary basis or on a two-tier basis. To say that we can judge this in advance of the Crowther Report is negative, and I think it would doom this Bill to early and fairly constant revision, in order to allow it room to expand in the next half century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the Secretary of State for the Environment, speaking on 16th November, seemed to regard some of the functions at present proposed for local government as being more appropriate to regional government. Dealing with the Birmingham overspill—and here we come
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
back to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) and to other points that were made on the West Midlands—the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I accept that such a regional approach does entail that the region as a whole has to cope with this problem".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 16th November, 1971; Vol. 11, 
	<i>c.</i> 238.]</p></blockquote>
In other words, what he is saying is that there must be a measure of regional government to ensure that land use planning is as efficient as possible. Yet he does not follow out the logic of his own argument, and say that until we know the pattern of such regional government we cannot possibly seek satisfactorily to allocate the functions contained in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the Minister will consider again this particular problem, because if boundaries depend on functions, and if functions, as the Secretary of State for the Environment suggests, must depend to a certain extent on what Crowther says, then we cannot decide here whether unitary or two-tier authorities are best until we know what the pattern of provincial government in England and Wales will be. I think that this problem is no less relevant to England than it is to Wales, although we have, as I have said, already made representations upon that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill as it stands leads to all sorts of inconsistencies. England and Wales are indissolubly linked so far as local government reform is concerned. We are aiming to do away with the separation of the big towns from their hinterland. I remind the Minister that the Welsh proposal separates Cardiff exactly from its hinterland. There is, therefore, no principle of universal application, even in this Bill. If my right hon. and hon. Friends see fit to divide the Committee upon this unitary principle, I will vote with them, not because I think that for Wales unitary authorities are necessarily the right solution—they may or may not be, depending upon the pattern—but because I believe that it would be premature and rash to pre-judge the argument between unitary and two-tier authorities before we have the report of the Crowther Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Roper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my right hon. Friend moved this Amendment last week he admitted that he was a London
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
Member, and therefore could speak on this matter with a certain detachment. At the moment he, of course, lives under a two-tier system of government rather than a unitary system—or a two-sphere system of government, in the words of the Minister last week—although I never quite know how two spheres balance upon each other; it would seem to be a very difficult performance. I do not know whether, in his Amendment, he intended to extend the unitary principle to Greater London so that there should perhaps be a unitary authority for the Greater London area. In some of his remarks I was a little worried that he might have been thinking of doing something of this sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although Amendment No. 1 refers to unitary authorities throughout the country, some of us were reassured when we saw Amendment No. 5, which is being taken with this Amendment, also standing in the name of my right hon. Friend. Amendment No. 5 refers to the annex to the Redcliffe-Maud Report which, in the case of certain parts of our country, makes it clear that although the general rule should be unitary authorities as the appropriate authorities to deal with the situation, there are certain other areas, as in London, where perhaps one should call an area a metropolitan district, and I am a little confused as to why we have accepted into the language these words "metropolitan county" and "metropolitan district". Perhaps when we come to discuss this, we can have a longer debate on the semantics. I always thought that "metropolitan" was something to do with archbishops—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only in Eastern Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and, unless the Church is about to propose many more archbishops in our other metropolitan counties and metropolitan districts, I think we ought to find a happier expression than "metropolitan county" and "metropolitan district". "Only in Eastern Europe", my hon. Friend says, are they metropolitans. I am grateful to my hon. Friend who comes from the east, telling me about the Eastern Church.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Stephen. I belong to West Hull, not East Hull.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting geographical distinction, but it is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you will appreciate, Sir Stephen, we in Lancashire think that the whole of Yorkshire is in the east and we cannot see the distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come to the question of certain areas in the country. I think, of course, principally about the area which, up to the publication of the Bill, we called South-East Lancashire, North-East Cheshire—sometimes abbreviated as SELNEC—but now I understand that we are to call them, until an Amendment is moved and perhaps carried, Greater Manchester—areas such as this, which are very difficult to deal with on the unitary basis. Redcliffe-Maud appreciated this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole post-war history of the Greater Manchester area is a result of the unsatisfactory system of local government, particularly the large cities in the centre of the conurbation, such as Manchester, needing room for redevelopment and housing development and unable to get it because of the attitudes of the authorities that surrounded it. In this situation the pattern of unitary authorities, one perhaps being the City of Manchester itself and the others perhaps corresponding to the metropolitan districts which are laid down in Redcliffe-Maud, would have perpetuated the problems of overall planning for a congested urban area which we have suffered since the war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think I need go into detail, but one only has to recall the battles that were fought with Lymm in Cheshire, with Westhoughton in Lancashire, about Manchester overspill, to realise the difficulties which have been caused in an area such as South-East Lancashire by a system of local government which divides what is essentially one urban built-up area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad, therefore, that besides areas such as Greater Manchester, Merseyside and the West Midlands we would be permitted to make further sub-Amendments to the Redcliffe-Maud Annex in order to introduce metropolitan districts, for example, in Tyneside, Hampshire and probably North Lancashire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic authority for overall planning purposes in urban conurbations like South-East Lancashire must cover a larger area than that laid down by the Minister, and more on the scale of that set out in
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
pages 220 onwards of Annex 1 of the Redcliffe-Maud Report which gives not only the built-up area but also some of the rural areas surrounding it. As was pointed out in an earlier part of the Report, personal services and housing—possibly education, which can be discussed later—are matters which could not be taken at conurbation level by an authority covering some 3 million people, an area corresponding in terms of population, if not in terms of geographical space, to that of Wales. In such a case one authority could not cover an enormous area and it would be essential to split it into metropolitan districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope my right hon. Friend will agree that as well as introducing unitary authorities into conurbations such as South-East Lancashire, North-East Cheshire, Mersey-side and West Midlands, he will consider where it would be inappropriate to do so, introducing a pattern of metropolitan counties and metropolitan districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the specific proposals in Annex 1 of the Redcliffe-Maud Report, it is worth making the point that the boundaries of the districts therein defined are more satisfactory than those devised by the Minister. When we examine the proposals in greater detail I hope we shall have an opportunity to consider, for example, that the proposition to put the cities of Manchester and Salford together is preferable to that introduced by the Minister in this Bill. There is no essential boundary between the city centres of the cities of Salford and Manchester. Therefore, to combine them into one metropolitan district is a more satisfactory way of dealing with the problem than that proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Principally I wish my right hon. Friend to make clear that his Amendment intends, as did Redcliffe-Maud, to ensure that while the unitary principle would be appropriate for middle-sized or large towns, it would not be so for the continuous built-up areas such as those in South-East Lancashire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First of all, I should like to say to my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) that when I signed the now infamous loquacity Motion, the main target was the Secretary of State and not my right hon. Friend who is well known for his brevity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of unitary authorities,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
I welcome the Minister's recantation of what he said in the Second Reading debate. We recognise the special nature of that debate where hon. Members in all parts of the House were extremely anxious to put forward local points of view. Consequently the broader principles did not get such a wide amount of attention as they would otherwise have had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the alarm expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John) at the silence from the benches opposite. I hoped that contributions in the common interest would be forthcoming from both sides of the Committee, but the angle and ominous position at which the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Speed) is sitting, from which he can slew round in a second and transfix anybody who has the temerity to rise to his feet, bodes ill for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our last meeting the Minister referred to the need to provide good and humane government. As far as Bristol is concerned, we have no need to change because we have an all-purpose authority which takes into account all the functions of local authorities. It is when one looks at the patchwork of many local authorities in areas surrounding Bristol that the case for unification through a unitary authority becomes more obvious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Second Reading debate the right hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Sir R. Turton) drew attention to the divorce between the social services and housing. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will surely agree that to unite the services for elderly people's dwellings and welfare services is necessary if they are to function efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already said that in Bristol we have no need to change our present system. In fact, the only complaint we have is that we are still awaiting the substantial portions of cheap building land which the two Ministers on the Government Front Bench gave us to understand would result from their work on the Land Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe the Government are basing their suggestion on what they believe to be managerial efficiency. Page 1 of the first volume of the Redcliffe-Maud Report, when referring to the changing pattern of local government, says that there must be a system which is able to
	<br><blockquote><p>"adapt itself without disruption to the present unprecedented process of change in the way
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
people live, work, move, shop and enjoy themselves."</p></blockquote>
It is on the question of change that I emphasise the need for unitary authority. Over the next generation we shall be faced with tremendous changes in our environment, and we shall require a greater flexibility in our social services, not only in the actual services rendered. If any hon. Member has had experience of a home dialysis unit being installed in a private or local authority home, he will know what I mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill brings together very many different parts of the local authority service. If we think of it in terms of the physical services or of personnel, I believe that there is a need for much greater flexibility, which can only come about through some sort of unitary system. If we consider the manning of local government, there is a great deal of discussion at the moment about teacher training. One of the points frequently made is that somebody who has trained as a teacher, and who feels, after a period of some years has elapsed, that he is not happy in this work, might feel that there is nothing else that he can satisfactorily turn to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This sort of complaint occurs in other parts of local authority service, and we should be looking forward to a form of personnel training in local authority work whereby people can switch comparatively easily from one branch to another, and the skills which they have acquired in, among other things, human relations will cross-fertilise all branches of the services and this will be achieved very much more easily under a unitary system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the evidence to the Redcliffe-Maud Report, the A.M.C., in criticising a two-tier system of Government, said that its lack of coherence was a drawback in that it creates confusion in the mind of those designed to serve, that there is a loss of efficiency because of friction between the two tiers, and also that there is duplication and a wasteful loss of manpower. I support this contention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon'. Members will know that there is a great growth malaise in management theory. Basically, two types of organisation can be distinguished. One is known as mechanistic and is appropriate to stable conditions, and the other is organic which is appropriate to changing conditions which give rise to constantly fresh problems and unforeseen requirements. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
suggest that the task which local government will face over the next 50 to 100 years will be so different from those envisaged that we have an essentially organic situation and a situation which can best be met by a complete integration of all the various services available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we think back to the beginning of this Parliament, it will be recalled that there were a number of questions put to the Prime Minister regarding responsibility for environmental matters. On each occasion the Prime Minister replied that particular questions of environment were the responsibility of the Minister on whose Department they impinged. This stonewalling went on for some time but, to their credit, the Government produced the Department of the Environment, and to some extent has reinforced the argument that I am trying to make, that these questions cannot be dealt with in a static structure of different organisations and that the whole thing should be brought together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) mentioned the question of remoteness. I am sure that many hon. Members have experienced in county areas parish elections, which attract a poll of something in the region of 90 per cent. and where urban or district elections attract a poll of 50 to 60 per cent. and county elections perhaps only 30 to 40 per cent. One might say that the degree of participation by the electorate is in inverse ratio to the importance of the functions discharged by a particular body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of remoteness will not be solved necessarily by the Government's proposals. The Mallavy Report on the Staffing of Local Government drew attention to the fact that in county areas it is possible for a strong chief officer and chairman completely to dominate a committee, because the meetings are so infrequent, and so much of the business is delegated to the chairman, that the ordinary members of the committee have virtually no control over it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way to overcome this problem is not to pay lip service to the idea of devolution to local level, but to make it possible for councillors to give the time, without excessive sacrifices, to enable them
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
to keep a watch on what is happening on the committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford that the case against the unitary authority has not been made. The case becomes very much stronger as the days go by, because we realise that local government is being called upon to face more and more problems, and I hope that even at this late stage the Minister will relent and accept our Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Carter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you know, I am a very new Member of the House and as such am still busily trying to absorb all the intricacies and details of Government and parliamentary life. One of the things which puzzle me is that we go to the length of establishing great, powerful bodies which are set up to establish areas of difficulty in the community, and when those bodies have sounded out a wide range of opinion in many areas and produced their reports, the Government reject those reports. I am sure that Continental people must find it most peculiar that we spend so much time examining in depth problems within our community, subjecting them to expert opinion and analysis, arriving at what the vast majority of people think is the right conclusion, and then the Government say, "You are not right".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the present Government are not alone in committing that crime—successive Governments have committed it—but one would have thought that on a matter such as local government, which affects everyone, there is a very strong case to be made for leaving all political considerations aside and for listening to those people who have looked at the problem in an entirely non-political way and who, at the end of the day, have reached a decision about recommendations which the vast majority of people in the country thought reasonable and proper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Maud Commission was established, I was a member of a local authority—the Rural District Council of Berkshire—where I still live. On that authority—and I believe I can speak for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
all other authorities in the area—we had great hopes of the outcome of the Commission because we were meeting all kinds of difficulties. We were too small a body. We had a new town in our midst which prompted a lot of the problems, and on many occasions, in order to solve our difficulties, we had to meet neighbouring authorities and produce joint agreements in order that we could economically, administratively and in)other ways, deal with problems with which we were confronted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seemed to me that the problems could be reduced to two areas: one, the economic, administrative and organisational side and, second—the principle that we all hold very dear—democracy. The system of local government within which I worked as an elected member, whilst being very good on democracy, was very bad on organisation. Occasions cropped up from time to time—and they increased in number during my six years on the council—where, as an authority, we had to approach other bodies—county councils, borough councils, parish councils and a whole range of neighbouring authorities—and we had to build arrangements between ourselves in order to solve pressing problems. In the main we succeeded, but the problems grew—problems like waste disposal, other environmental considerations, recreation, and so forth. It became evident that the multiplicity of authorities stood in our way and was impeding our progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we were faced with that organisational and economic problem, I must admit that democratically in a country area—I know this goes for most country areas—members of the community always felt that they were a part of the decision-making process. This contrasts greatly with the situation which we have in our major cities now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent part of Britain's second city—Birmingham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Third.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must have got it wrong. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell). I should not have liked that to have gone on record uncorrected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst we have an excellent city council, I find that people, particularly on the periphery of the city, do not feel that they know what is happening at the centre.
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
The organisation of the city is very good. It has an excellent housing record. Its education record is quite good, although there appears to be some disagreement politically about the principles involved. One could therefore say that that organisation, both in terms of efficiency and management, is an excellent body; but as far as democracy is concerned, it is very bad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those twin pillars of experience of representing a city as a Member of Parliament, and having served for six years on a local authority in the country, I recognise that in the unitary principle one has the complete answer. Perhaps it is not the complete answer, but it goes most of the way towards solving the problems that occur in local government. There could be an authority which is large enough in terms of population, economy and so forth to be able to deal with the vast majority of problems that local authorities are confronted with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the White Paper published in 1970, which again came from the Maud Commission, there was this additional proposal that there should be, within unitary authority areas, local councils. Admittedly, as far as that proposal went, local councils would not have had power. They could not have taken decisions about finance. However, what it would have enabled local councils to have done, especially in cities like Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, was to have been part of the consultative process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my opinion, democracy is not always about taking massive decisions concerning the building of tower blocks of flats or the building of semi-detached houses. To a large extent, it hinges on the ability of the greatest number of people in the community being able to have a say in the problems with the full knowledge that their views will be listened to. Therefore, the unitary principle, as I see it, would have dealt at one blow with the two principal problems which I have encountered both in local government and in my time as a Member of Parliament—the problem of organisation—to be able to support economically all the things that local authorities are concerned with today and, secondly, it would have enabled a greater number of people to have participated in Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I see it, the Bill gives us two classes of authority. Organisationally and democratically the metropolitan authorities
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
are to remain much as they are now. For example, the people in my ward in Birmingham will have no opportunity at all of making their views known about planning, education or housing. But in the area in which I live in Berkshire the parish councils are to continue. So I should have thought that if democracy is to be more pronounced in some parts of the country than others, the Minister should look very closely at the whole principle involved. It is a strange fact that in an age when a growing number of people are wanting to participate in democracy, local government decisionmaking, etc., we are confronted with a Bill which segregates people into those who can play a part and those who cannot. I would have liked to have gone on, Sir Stephen, but I know that many hon. Members on this side of the Committee wish to make a contribution to the debate. Of course, they will not be impeded by interventions from the other side of the Committee, which I am very disappointed about. Nevertheless, I hope that the issue of the unitary principle, which appears to cover all the problems and difficulties that local government is confronted with, will be considered once again by the Minister with a view, even at this eleventh hour, to revising his Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the brief speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) last week, and the even more brief intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter), I think it is necessary that those of us who will have to vote on this critical Amendment should express views on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that some hon. Members might feel that as a Welsh Member speaking on an English Amendment, I ought to offer some sort of apology to the Committee. This I certainly do not propose to do. For what it is worth, Sir Stephen, I offer my sympathies to those English Members, but remind them that this was not of our making. It was the Government who made the decision to make this one Bill. In this respect both the English Members and the Welsh Members of the Committee are suffering from similar faults. Certainly if we had a separate Bill, which we wanted—I am sure that would have been the right thing to have
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
done—we could have had a fuller and more democratic discussion to enable all the many points to be enunciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several Members on this side of the Committee last week and some again this morning advocated the unitary principle. My hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) referred to the statistics of the Redcliffe-Maud Commission. My hon. Friend told us that one of its virtues was that it was an independent body, that it had sat for 181 days and had called and taken evidence from some 2,156 witnesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were reminded this morning by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) that he thought it was a pity that such an independent Commission's recommendations should have been ignored. I suppose there is some truth in that. Indeed, as a cautious Welshman, I am somewhat alarmed to realise that the Maud Commission not only sat for that length of time and received that number of witnesses but cost some £378,000, all now apparently to be thrown down the drain, since the Maud Commission came out in favour of unitary authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fortunately or otherwise, we in Wales did not have the benefit of a report from the Redcliffe-Maud Commission, which is not to say that we have heard nothing of unitary and two-tier systems of local government. Those hon. Members who sat in the last Parliament, and perhaps even the Minister of State, Welsh Office, would probably confirm that Wales suffered a glut of White Papers and consultative documents on local government. Although the Redcliffe-Maud Report did not affect us, we read it, and we discussed the various White Papers and consultative documents, but there are still strong differences of opinion in the Principality, as there are in England, and even on this side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1967 White Paper on local government in Wales recommended the two-tier or two-sphere authority. In 1970 we had an hybrid White Paper—single tier for Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, and two-tier for the rest of Wales. The Consultative Document in 1971 seemed to revert to a two-tier authority, and we now have a Bill which, for a very large portion of Wales, has ignored the whole lot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst talking of White Papers, I should mention the "red paper", published at considerable expense by the City of Cardiff, which resulted in a considerable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
mutilation of the County of Glamorgan. I was pleased to note the Minister of State, Welsh Office, reading the "Save Glamorgan from the carve-up" literature this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the debate we shall have to decide how to vote on the issue. The Minister must now be sorry that on Second Reading he rebuked my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) for a lack of advocacy of the unitary system. Having heard my right hon. Friend's brief speech at our last Sitting, the Minister must now be sorry that he raised that issue. My right hon. Friend, in a most powerful speech, delivered in his usual moderate manner—except for when he was Chief Whip—took us step by step through all the arguments in favour of the unitary authority. His arguments, his language, his very moderation, were such as could charm a bird off a tree, and I felt like a sinner come to repentance, almost as though I should renounce my past heresies of advocating a two-tier system and accept with acclamation the principle of unitary authorities. I said "almost"; I did not get so far. However, at that stage my right hon. Friend was well on the way to winning my support, for what it is worth, for the unitary authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fearing that I might have succumbed to my right hon. Friend's charm, if not to his arguments, I turned up the report of the debate in the Welsh Grand Committee, on 13th May, 1970, when we, too, argued the question of unitary or two-tier authority. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. George Thomas) argued for unitary authorities. We are aware of his gift of charm, but I remind the Committee that on that occasion not one back-bench Welsh speaker spoke for or was in favour of unitary authorities as suggested by the then Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be a shame, but that was the view, and it serves to show the differences between those of us who represent constituencies in Wales and those who represent constituencies in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that time, the Crowther Commission had not reported. Had the Crowther Commission reported as to whether there should be further devolution in Wales, and the possibility of provincial councils
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
in England, and had we had the benefit of that report, a different or smaller type of unitary authority might have been suggested, which might well have had some effect and influence on the decisions we reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State, Welsh Office, might well assist us this morning by letting us know when the Crowther Report will be published, whether the Minister has yet received it, whether it is to be made available to the Committee in pieces, as it comes out, or whether we shall have to await the final document. That report is of great importance to our deliberations on the Amendment and on those Amendments that deal with provinces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the arguments, at the end of the day in Wales there was a consensus view that for Wales local government based on the suggested unitary authorities was not sufficiently local or democratic, whatever the rest of the country might feel. I would commend to those advocating unitary authorities, and to those advocating two-tier authorities, that they read the debate in the Welsh Grand Committee as it might help some hon. Members to decide how they should move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford, in his speech last week, mentioned the very low turn-outs in local elections. The turn-out varies considerably in different parts of the country, and his argument of the low turn-out in many local elections—one of his many arguments in favour of unitary authorities—is not always borne out throughout Great Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to make the point that the fact that the unit is smaller need not necessarily result in a greater degree of democracy in the terms which most hon. Members would wish to see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point, but the converse is likewise not true—that a large unitary authority must preclude a greater degree of participation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth noting that my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Fred Evans) referred to his own locality, and, since his figures are on record, it might be worth having others in the opposite direction. My hon. Friend referred to a township of 3,000 to 4,000 people with an 85 per cent. poll in urban council elections, and to a village in his constituency of 500 voters with a 96 per cent.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
poll in local elections, suggesting—certainly as far as that village is concerned—that the small unit shows a greater participation, with more people using their votes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to repeat all the arguments used in last year's debate, but I would like to quote my hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot), who made a most powerful speech. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Why not let the people of England, if they want to, go ahead with their reform of local government and let the people of Wales go ahead with the one they prefer and then see who does the thing better?"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Welsh Grand Committee,</i> 13th May, 1971; 
	<i>c.</i> 23–4.]</p></blockquote>
I shall do that today, and, say to my right hon. and hon. Friends that if they believe that the unitary system of local government is best for England, I will support them in it by all means, as long as they do not wish the accursed thing on the people of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure you, Sir Stephen, that I had no intention of speaking in this debate, but I have been stimulated by the contributions so far, and in particular those of my hon.

Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack), to whom I have given notice that I intended to speak of him and who I am pleased to see in his place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a time-honoured cliché to say that one does not intend to speak for long, but I do not intend to do so. I wish to make a modest contribution to the debate. But, like a miner embarking on a new face in a pit, I hope to move from the almost multi-national, speaking as a Welshman, nature of talking of small packets, parishes lying on the edge of big cities, and the like. I believe that institutions are meaningless unless they are manned by good men. This is so obvious that I need not dwell on it. I see that my right hon. Friend the Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Goronwy Roberts) agrees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Goronwy Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was indicating my complete assent to what my hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson) mentioned a point which is of serious concern to people like myself. He referred to institutions and the right kind of people, and used the term "good men". Before I vote for the Amendment, will my hon. Friend tell the Committee what he means by the right kind of people, particularly when we are talking about democracy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) may not be a classical scholar, but he may have heard of the combination of nouns, "nature" and "nurture". He may well be a determinist. I know that the hon. Gentleman is not a Marxist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I should like to revert to the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack), who initially egged me on to make this contribution. He referred to the calibre of men, the quality of men—and of course I include women—who offer themselves for high office. I should like to link this with the physical fact of distance and size. Sheer size is important. It does not daunt me, particularly in the case of comprehensive education, although it sometimes worries me that in large schools, possibly with over 2,000 pupils, it is sometimes difficult, perhaps because of the mobility of the pupils, for the teachers to keep them always under surveillance, which may lead to disturbances of all kinds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, sheer size in the context of local government daunts me not at all. Nonetheless, sizeisimportant. Forexample, we all pay attention to China, because of its sheer size of 700 million people. I have listened carefully this morning to the situation of Birmingham, which I understand is not the second city, and towns of that size. I am on the Minister's side here. I intend to argue against unity of government and in favour of two-tier government, which we shall shortly adopt in Humberside, and we greatly welcome this combination of the city man—homo-conurbation we might call him—and the men of the villages around the big cities, mainly farmers and, in the case of the Humber, fishermen, many of whom are in my constituency.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a sneaking sympathy with the hon. Member for Cannock when he talks of getting good men to man these councils. However, the snag is that, in my opinion, urban life tends, if not to debase, to coarsen the quality of living. I believe that men and women who live in more elemental conditions—farmers and villagers in the open countryside as well as fishermen—and who are nearer to nature and may face danger in their occupations have basically more moral and physical fibre and are, by and large, of better stuff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly my hon. Friend is of good ethnic stock. Having been among the coalfields and the pits, he must know that the men who work in them are not, by definition, urban in the sense perhaps of Chicago or London. They form small pockets of population and do not come within the commercial atmosphere of large urban centres which leads one to think of monetary gain and thus to a lowering of values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no accident that in our large cities more and more businessmen are standing for election to councils. This is obviously closely linked with the question of investment planning and ownership of land. People who live in cities and make money through real estate development can, if they are elected to councils—there have been many scandals in the past—
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
obtain forward knowledge enabling them to place investments and to buy land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without probing too deeply into minor points, I believe that the Committee is seized of the fact that living in cities can have a bad effect upon the open, genuine, elemental, natural behaviour of men who live close to the land and to the sea. Men who face danger tend to be collectivists, as in the case of an army at war. All those who live only by the combined effort and co-operation of their colleagues are collectivists. For example, the Labour Party is a collectivist and co-operative party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I believe that large cities can overwhelm the contiguous countryside. The hon. Member for Cannock made a very good point. It is a fact that the city can dwarf the countryside, which is not a good thing. For those reasons, I am in favour of this section of the Bill, and not only because Humberside has benefited from it. I need not emphasise what has been said by leaders in my own community—men of enormous status and stature in local government like Alderman Sir Leo Schultz. The Labour Party in Hull is in favour of this particular section of the Bill—and I emphasise the words "particular section". We are thankful for large mercies in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that a two-tier system certainly suits East Yorkshire, Humberside, and North Lincolnshire. Later we might discuss the nefarious attempt of certain hon. Members opposite who wish to filch Parts of Lindsey out of this very wise scheme and very helpful division that they have embarked upon in East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the question of the quality of the council, we pay too little attention to this point. Both parties have powerful
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
machines and often these virtues, attributes and values tend to be passed over. They would be passed over more and more in a unitary system, where the larger numbers of powerful commercial elements in the cities would dominate what I term small units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an old-fashioned sentiment that people who live on the land and people who live in small units, as in villages—one must not talk about their institutions here such as chapels, schools and voluntary societies like the women's institutes—tend to knit together and to build up in people something which I believe to be important in modern life, namely, an ability to live and work with and to help their neighbours. There is a competitive—dare I use this mischievous word in this Committee?—capitalist economy in the cities, where people depend on money and think in terms of money constantly. This is a bad thing. One cannot help cities getting bigger, because size begets size. The bigger a city is, the bigger it becomes. Therefore, the Government should watch this tendency of urbanisation and endeavour to balance these two competing segments of our national population. There are fewer people living on the land, fewer people living from fishing activities, and fewer people who are not being attracted to cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is happening all over the world. It is sad to see it in Africa, of all places—footloose hungry men and women. It is just the same in the United Kingdom. If I may say so to my Welsh colleagues, speaking as one who was unlucky not to have been born in the Principality, it seems to me that they have suffered a sad loss in the last 100 years. So many of their best people come not merely to teach in London, but to serve in the House of Commons. This is a big loss in Welsh local government. Many men who have been leaders and have done a wonderful job in local government in Cardiff, Swansea and elsewhere may fill an honourable post, but it is perhaps a post which has less impact upon their own people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of answering the question, Sir Stephen. Like yourself, I wish to keep this Committee within the bounds of order and therefore, watching your face, and in view of your having been so helpful and kind to me, I think I shall now sit down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page): It might be for the convenience of the Committee if I were to answer some of the points now. I may even be so successful in clearing up the points which have been raised that the Committee will be able to come to a decision on this Amendment very soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson) said that large cities can overwhelm. Implementation of the White Paper of the previous Government would have resulted in the creation of 50 or 60 areas, cities or whatever one might call them, and I am quite sure that 50 or 60 unitary authorities would have been overwhelming to the public. The unitary system is the only system which has been put before us. It has been suggested by one hon. Gentleman that perhaps we could have created many more unitary authorities. We would then have to go into a whole new geography which is not before us on this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) summed up his argument by putting two points—first, remoteness, and, secondly, that an all-purpose authority could better serve the public. He said that the unitary authority would not be remote from the people; there would not be that remoteness between the councillors and the electorate that he thought one would get with a two-sphere or two-tier system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the argument to be that under a unitary system the public know where to go for help or to make complaints and that this is a nice tidy system in that somewhere or other there is a building in a unitary authority where the public can go to make their complaints, and therefore there will be no remoteness.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
But if that building is remote, as it would be in all the 50 or 60 authorities of the unitary system, then surely geographically there is a remoteness, and if geographically there is a remoteness then there is a remoteness between the electorate and the councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Many millions of the population, in London and in the provincial counties, are quite used to a two-tier system and have no difficulty in finding their local councillors or their local council where they can go for help or make complaints. What is being said in this Amendment is that those citizens who now enjoy the county borough status of their council will be completely confused if they are told in future that they must live under councils like the rest of the country. Millions of people in the rest of the country are used to the two-tier system, and I see no reason why the county borough citizens should feel remote when the same system is adopted for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernest Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the reason we are spending so much time on this matter and have had so many reports on it is that the present system is not working; it is not satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The improvement on that system which we propose will be satisfactory. A sensible two-sphere system of local government can positively help the public to know their councillors and their council and to know where to go for help and to complain. They turn naturally to the immediate borough or district over a wide range of subjects most likely to affect them. Under the Government's proposals boroughs and districts will be responsible for the local environment, and the general public will go to them in respect of planning applications, housing matters or environmental health—all those matters which the public would expect to go to their local councillors about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall undoubtedly have to have some form of publicity and advice as the new councils take effect. Later in the Bill, in Clause 140, there are powers given to publicise the affairs of a council, and we must think nationally, when this scheme comes into operation, of perhaps a sustained local and national publicity campaign to inform the people. But this will be supplemental to the common
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
sense of the people, who will go to their districts about those sorts of things which directly concern them in those districts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman answer one point which he raised on the question of Clause 140? I know he intended to convey to the Committee that steps have been taken to overcome the disadvantages of remoteness, and he has said what a local authority might do in making known its services, but I notice that Clause 140 says that a local authority "may" do certain things. It does not go beyond what I consider to be a permissive condition in the Bill and not one of obligation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said we might have to consider instituting a national and local publicity campaign. I certainly would not wish, from the centre, to order local authorities to carry out a campaign. That would be against the whole principle of reorganisation and of giving local authorities discretion to run their own affairs and to make public their own affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I return to what I was about to say about the matters raised by the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has raised an important point. He is saying that he is not prepared to give directions to local authorities. The Minister must at least try to put his case consistently. He cannot direct authorities not to provide free milk and other things and then come to this Committee and talk about giving freedom to local authorities because he wants to dodge the issue of saying that they should make their services known.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder which Government were prepared to give local authorities the most discretion in managing their own affairs. I should like hon. Members opposite to think back to what their Government did to prevent local authorities from using discretion in their own areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pontypridd dealt with the coming Crowther Report. We are expecting the Crowther Report next year, but the present Government and Redcliffe-Maud agreed that provinces which were recommended by Maud and may be recommended by the Crowther Report are too large for the operation of local government services. They may be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
right as advisory bodies, or as taking some powers from central Government, but not to operate local government services. I do not think that our proposed reorganisation of local government depends upon or conflicts with the Crowther Report. We are expected to proceed quickly with the reform of local government and not to delay it indefinitely for some further report to be published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely one of the points made by the Secretary of State for the Environment was that land use planning is a regional function. It is now being specifically allocated to a local authority in the Bill. Clearly, if the Secretary of State for the Environment is right, that is a futile exercise, because it is giving it to a body which is too small to exercise it properly. If it is to be given to a provincial regional body, then surely the Crowther Report directly impinges on the work we are now doing. Therefore, would it not be wise to wait for its recommendations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to dodge this issue, but it will come up on a later Amendment, and I think we should discuss it in detail then. At the moment I merely say that I do not think that the Crowther Report can possibly conflict with what we are doing in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) raised a point which the Committee will wish to consider carefully when we deal with functions, namely, the difficulty of drawing the dividing line between social services and housing. In all functions, we have had difficulty in drawing the right line between functions or parts of functions in local government. We have altered what was set out in the White Paper to what is set out in the Bill. We shall be discussing functions undoubtedly in this Committee. However, I am quite convinced that putting functions into two different bodies of local government does not necessarily create friction or duplication. With proper organisation, they can be carried out efficiently, economically and democratically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) spoke about balancing the economic side and the organisation side with the democratic side of local government. I think we have balanced them by the system which we
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
have put forward in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman spoke as if the Government were not reducing the number of local authorities and not making them more efficient by streamlining. Of course, in the numbers which we now contemplate we have balanced the economic side of local government with the democratic side. The hon. Gentleman spoke about his constituents in Birmingham having no say in education or welfare. He is mistaken, because there would be a metropolitan district responsible for both those services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I have touched on such of the points that have been raised in the debate today which were not raised at the previous Sitting. In the debate today, although new points have been raised, to a great extent they covered much the same ground as before. I hope that the Committee will now come to a decision on the Amendment so that we may proceed to some of the important Amendments on the Amendment Paper. I am not trying to shut up the Committee. I could not do that, Sir Stephen; that is your responsibility. But I think it is agreed on both sides of the Committee that local authorities should not be kept waiting for the reform proposed in the Bill any longer than is necessary. When we have had a good debate we should try to make up our minds as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Swain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This does not appear to be a debate. All the speeches are being made from one side of the Committee. The Minister has my sympathy. He has his boys and girls sitting behind him, but unfortunately he is the only person put up by the Government to defend what this side of the Committee contends to be an indefensible case. This is a remarkable situation.

This weekend my mail included 70 circulars, which I divided between Labour-controlled and Conservative-controlled authorities. Forty-seven of them came to me as a member of this Committee from Conservative-controlled authorities, asking me to support Amendments which would be tabled by Conservative Members of Parliament, so as to protect the interests of the areas represented by the hon. Members opposite. It is apparent to me that those constituencies are not being represented in this Committee. A considerable number of Amendments have been tabled in the names of Conservative

I belong to a county constituency which was opposed to the Redcliffe-Maud Report because it declared itself in favour of unitary authorities. One side of my constituency is coal mining and heavy industry and the other side is farming and beautiful parkland. The biggest branch of the National Farms' Union in our county is in my constituency. So we have a very complex programme. We have to satisfy the needs of the industrial urban areas and at the same time satisfy the needs of the agricultural community. To give an illustration in figures, in one part of my constituency there are 17 houses to the acre; in another part there are 17 acres to one house. This shows how difficult it is to represent the interests of people in an area in one composite undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first place we were against unitary authorities—and I assisted in leading a campaign to demonstrate this—except where certain conditions were denned by Maud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely one of the bases of a unitary authority is to try to blend town and country together so that what is, in fact, a cold war at the present moment does not continue. Would that situation not be remedied if a unitary authority controlled my hon. Friend's area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is a lawyer, and lawyers have a bad habit of interrupting witnesses into trying to assist them. If my right hon. Friend had been patient and had waited until the end of my argument he might have drawn nearer to my point of view in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to describe the difficulties encountered in a county area when we seriously examined the Report of the Redcliffe-Maud Commission. We held a
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
long series of meetings to discuss its recommendations. Ultimately some people in the constituency argued in favour of unitary authorities, and others against. With experience of parish, rural, urban and county councils, I could fully understand the stand taken by many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the points put forward at the time—and this has been raised this morning—concerned the employment of the right type of people to serve on councils in unitary authorities. Being a political animal, I have always maintained that no Conservative would be the right type of person to represent anybody on a local authority. The difference between us is not in our intellectual capacity but in our political honesty and integrity. Therefore, to select the right type of people rests upon the political view they hold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dealing specifically with Derbyshire, I should like to refer to the points of view put forward by the Minister. Right hon. and hon. Members will be familiar with the powers vested in county councils. They cover highways and education, and in every area in Derbyshire the county council has sub-offices for these two items. So the argument that nobody can go to the offices of the present county council falls to the ground immediately. In my own area the Derbyshire County Council has offices dealing with highways and other things, including planning, where the county council has powers to delegate to sub-committees in local authorities the rights of planning. In the County of Derby, as elsewhere, there is an area planning office with sub-committees served by specialists co-opted on to them to deal with specific points of planning in the localities that they represent. This shows that we have in the present system a model of a unitary authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all appreciate that urban districts operate within limited powers according to local government statute. Therefore, they are only the second-sphere authority to the county; so inevitably the urban district has to have direct contact at all times with the A.P.O. on planning and with the local surveyor or engineer on highways, street lighting and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister cannot put forward a better argument in defence of unitary authorities his case unfortunately falls to the ground because exactly the same system could operate within a unitary authority as is operated by county councils
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
at present, which have higher powers in local authorities than urban, rural or parish councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a large constituency. One half of the parish councils are 100 per cent. Labour and the other half are 100 per cent. so-called Independent. On election days these Independents have a blue card in the car running about for the Conservative candidate, so they declare they are independent. Nevertheless democracy has its say. In the last local elections in my constituency in the Clay Cross urban district, which is 100 per cent. Labour controlled, they were opposed for every seat that they were defending, and there was a 73 per cent. poll. That is how democracy should be made to work by the people who intend it to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the system of democracy in local elections which falls down. It is the people operating within the system who fall down. No system can force a person to go to the voting station if he does not wish to go. Therefore, if they are encouraged, steered and directed and, above all, given honest opinions we shall get a high percentage of polls; so that democracy can work even within a two-tier system. I am sure that it could work equally within a unitary system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sheffield City Council and I are at loggerheads—the place where I have been for my holidays for the last 20 years—over certain boundary changes. But that City Council is a very proud authority and is one of the best Labour-controlled councils in Great Britain. I defy anybody to contradict that. It has made terrific strides and great progress, but it is a county borough. In 1967 it took over a large part of the County of Derby on an order made by my right hon. Friend who was Minister at the time. At the last May election each of these areas that were taken over by Sheffield at that time—the parish of Eckington and Beighton—were in the rural district council of Chesterfield and at the same time part and parcel of the Derbyshire County Council. We always had very high polls in those districts, and, since they went over to Sheffield, the poll has not dropped in any respect. Again, the system can operate if it is made to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wrote a paper for presentation at the 1947 urban district councils conference at Folkestone advocating a serious and immediate change in the structure of
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
local government. However, unlike the Government's proposals, I recommended that the fiscal structure should be the first priority, and that the physical structure would fit in when we knew how we were to finance it. Unfortunately, successive Governments have not seen fit, until now, to reorganise local government. It is now our duty to our constituents to decide, in Committee and in the House, which type of local authority and which system of reconstruction of local government we should adopt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones) proved beyond doubt that this Bill should have been in two parts—one section dealing with Wales and one with England. When we discuss the Welsh section I shall hesitate to intervene in a foreign affairs debate. However, we in this Committee have to deal with this extremely complex problem. Wales believes specifically in a two-tier system—quite rightly so, in my opinion, since it has always maintained that what is good enough for England is not good enough for Wales; and I believe it, since I have always said that if there had been no Derbyshire lodgers there would never have been any Welshmen. It is also said that the only people in Ireland are Welshmen who could not swim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that an argument can be made, at this moment of time as opposed to the situation four or five years ago, for the setting up of unitary authorities. I am a convert to unitary authorities. Those of my constituents who are members of local authorities are not converts at present. However, they feel that conversion to unitary authorities with the benefits arising therefrom will be far better adopted in principle than the current hotchpotch of a Bill. Thus I hope the Minister will pray in aid some of his hon. Friends—the silent majority as they have quite rightly been called; there are no people in Madame Tussauds more deaf and dumb than hon. Gentlemen opposite—so that some reasonable suggestions or contributions to the debate will be forthcoming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. The hon. Gentleman always listens to our speeches and makes measured replies, and we are grateful to him for that. I shall try to bring one or two new points forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regard as an extremely serious issue the kind of local government reform which we are to adopt. I interrupted the Minister during his speech, when he was putting forward the arguments in favour of the two-tier system. Every hon. Member on this Committee is in favour of local government reform. We know that it is desperately needed. Throughout the country in every local government office there are men and women who have dedicated their lives to the service of local government. They are sick and tired of the arguments which have taken place. They want to see an Act on the Statute Book in order to know the kind of administration within which they will work in the future. We must get it right. We cannot continually chop and change every five years in order to adopt new suggestions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was in the sixth form at grammar school, I had an English mistress who, at meetings of the debating society used to accuse me of seeing all sides. She used to say, "Armstrong, you must remember that on the big issues you cannot clear an abyss in two jumps." I commend that to the Minister, because I regard the present proposals as a compromise. He has tried to please everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent a constituency which has three urban district councils and two rural district councils. In that constituency there are men and women who have dedicated themselves to the service of local government. I do not think they would agree with the speech which I am making this morning. I can understand that. They have served in urban and rural district councils, and they regard that type of administration as being the salt of the earth. There are many prejudices against the big boroughs and cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish now to refer to something which was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston-upon-Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson). I spent my formative years in
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
a closely-knit mining village in West Durham, with an urban district council. When I started teaching I entered the Borough of Sunderland. I later worked for the county, and became a member of the Borough Council and Chairman of the Education Committee. I am now convinced, whether we have 60 authorities, or 90 authorities, or 120 authorities or more, that the unitary principle is the basis for real local government reform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend turn his thoughts to the question of size? Like himself, I am against a multiplicity of small, perhaps overstaffed and certainly inefficient, small units. However, the Bill does not suggest that that should be so. The Bill proposes two types of councils, both much larger, which would meet his main criterion of efficiency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend will be patient I shall come to that argument: Meanwhile, I would say only that my hon. Friend has lived far too long in London. He is Northumbrian and he talked this morning as though Northumberland were the same today as when he left it. I can assure him that even in Northumberland we have television. There are actually television sets in the North of England. We have electricity. Nothing concerns and annoys me more than the constant repetition of the difference between the North and the South, and the town and the country. We hear such nonsense on that topic. It is no wonder that we cannot get on with people from overseas. Some Londoners who travel North of Potter's Bar think they are in foreign parts where a completely different type of animal is to be found. That is not true. When talking to my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) I do not feel during our discussions that because he is a Londoner he will have a completely different view from mine. This false distinction makes a nonsense of trying to establish a local government system that will serve both town and country together. It is not true that a person in West Durham is a different kind of local government elector and needs a different system from anywhere else in the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sitting here seething internally under this personal attack. If only the hon. Gentleman were to listen carefully—which he normally does! He is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
making this a total confusion. No one—and certainly not I—would ever argue 
	<i>vis-à-vis</i> north and south. The hon. Gentleman knows me well enough to know this. He can talk about football, north against south, or any other social pursuit, but as regards local government I was attempting to suggest—no more—that there is a certain virtue in quality in living in an open, natural space, which is not built up like our large urban conurbations. That was the point I was making—not north 
	<i>v.</i> south. I am as much a northerner as he is, a.nd I go back home. I was back home a few weeks ago where the National Coal Board is bulldozing my own village, including the house where I was born, for 5 million tons of coal. I have as much affinity with the North as he has; so do not let him colour me by associating me too much with this "wen" in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have misunderstood what my hon. Friend said, I am sorry. But I understood that he was saying that the fishermen and the farmer—the man who lived close to the land—was a different type of individual from the person who lived in the town. If he did not say that, I am sorry that I misunderstood him, but if he reads the Report of what he said today he will find that he was implying that people who live near to the land are physically and morally superior and certainly different from those who live in the town areas—which I deny entirely. I do not accept that distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to remind the Minister of what my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Dennis Howell) said. We were talking about effective local government. In the Minister's speech to the Committee he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The principle is not primarily one of efficiency, or tradition, or loyalties, or the support of the existing establishment … it is to try to produce local government units which will be—and will be recognised as being—capable of good and humane government."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 25th November, 1971; 
	<i>Standing Committee D, c.</i> 39.]</p></blockquote>
I suggest to the Minister that that means that we have to achieve a balance between what we call democracy and efficiency. We cannot disregard either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have in my constituency what I think will be the smallest urban district council in the country. I certainly know of none smaller. The population is 2,810. When we talk of the proper use of resources, and so on, the difficulties in this urban district
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
can be imagined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that township we have all the advantages of participation and of democratic procedure. The people come to see me. A Member of Parliament deals with matters that are, in fact, matters for the attention of the urban district council. I gather that this is the experience in both town and country—no division here. Every Member of Parliament certainly spends half of his time dealing with matters which are more the concern of local government than central Government, and we ought to ask ourselves why this happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coupled with that is another issue that we all understand and to which we have to find the answer. Why is it that when there is a Labour central Government there is a swing to Tory local government administration, and vice versa? We know very well that next May, however distinguished local councillors and aldermen may be, there will be a swing to Labour authorities largely because of the activities of central Government. Therefore, when we consider the unitary and two-tier principle we must remind ourselves that we want to attract the right kind of people—and I will not venture into saying who the right kind of people are, but they are people who are willing to give their time and efforts to local administration. The relationship between central and local government is all important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may not carry the whole Committee with me, but I believe that one of the reasons why there is so much apathy today in local government elections is the difficulty in attracting the right kind of person. This is the case whichever Government is in power; I am not trying to make a party political point. In both town and country it is believed that the local authority has not much power anyway, that everything is decided at Westminster and it depends on the Prime Minister and the Cabinet and the kind of Government at Westminster. This deters people from voting and it deters the right kind of people from coming forward into local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue is this: my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) was talking about the 70 per cent. poll. To be quite honest, the only occasion we get a 70 per cent. poll in local government is when the electors jointly feel that they have a terrific grievance against the people in power. It is not a

positive vote of 70 per cent. but a vote against. Indeed, our electoral process disturbs me a great deal. Far from getting a positive vote at any election—local and national—we get a vote against a sense of grievance. We therefore have to consider this balance between democracy and efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People have a lively interest in preserving or improving local services which affect the household—transport, the provision of schools, libraries, playgrounds, refuse collection and the rest. But most people are not political animals, and I am glad about that. I would not like everybody in the country to be like us. It would be a remarkable country. But there are people who are not interested. They are more interested in their own affairs—in gardening and their hobbies and pastimes—and they have every right so to be. The silent majority are not criminals; they are not even anti-social because they do not want to write to their local newspapers every week and attend political meetings and so on. They are not strange creatures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that although we have an interest in transport, schools and so on, it is not necessarily related to a sense of community identification. When I was chairman of the education committee in Sunderland I found that one of the most aggravating things for my constituents and the electors in Sunderland was the fact that if they lived at Ryhope, which was just over the town boundary, invariably they received better grants because the grants were under the discretion of the local authority. They had rather better grants in the county area than in the town area. In the town area we had a very good local newspaper which went into about 95 per cent. of the homes in the town, and we were reminded every day by correspondents that our chief job was to keep the rates down. They do not suffer the same pressure in a county area where they do not have a local newspaper blaring at them night after night. This is certainly one of the considerations we had in the town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that most people want effective government. I have always been in favour
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
of many more local government discretions being made mandatory and being done by central Government. I will mention one which illustrates the point. I have always thought that, whether a youngster lived in remote Durham or in London or in a new town, the maintenance grant for children in secondary schools ought to be exactly the same. It ought to be a charge on the central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes I get a telephone call from somebody who lives in a little hamlet in my constituency complaining about a certain service that he is not getting. He says, "I pay the same rates as people in Newcastle and Durham. Therefore, I am entitled to the same service." Reading the Redcliffe-Maud Report, there is no doubt that after receiving all the evidence, after considering the views of people up and down the country, the Commission came down absolutely in favour of unitary government—not because it was the most democratic, although I would argue that it is just as democratic as elsewhere, or because it fulfilled some of the standards that the Minister was talking about, but because it was effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have watched the evolution of local government and seen the men and women who have given such great service, and we have a duty to get away from prejudices and pressures—and I know how heavy the pressures must be on the Minister—but we have to get above that in order to provide an effective system which meets the challenge, not only of today, but of the years ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Minister in his reply will tell me that he is not envisaging small authorities like my small urban council; they will be bigger authorities. If we talk about participation, this could, in fact, bring paralysis. Sometimes I look round my area and think of the things I advocated 30 years ago and they still have not been brought into operation. We have public inquiry after public inquiry, and sometimes I think we would have had urban renewal by now if we had not had to have so many public inquiries. I am all for the individual having the right to protest, but we must find a balance. With the best will in the world, if one is to do what is best for the majority, sometimes one must offend a lot of people. One cannot please everybody. My complaint about the two-tier system is that I suspect it has become
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
Government policy in an attempt to please everybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need, above all, to improve the quality of the decision-making process. This means better use of scarce resources of money and skilled manpower. If anybody does his homework on these matters, it is the Minister for Local Government and Development. When he was in opposition as a Whip he used to keep me late at night, but I did not mind because he always knew what he was talking about. Even in the early hours of the morning he had done his homework thoroughly and I know he will have studied the Maud Report meticulously. Does he not agree, after studying the Maud Report—which was well researched, with evidence taken from all quarters—that we must carefully consider how we shall use the very scarce resources not only of money but of skilled manpower?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the amount of skilled manpower that we shall need for the new social services, in the extension of community work, in the protection of the environment, and so on, how on earth will we find the manpower if we split it up among so many different authorities? My experience of county borough work suggests that the building of the proper planning team and getting together the manpower capable of doing the job needs an authoriiy where the elected members and those who serve them recognise clearly the powers they have and where the power lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must protect individual rights—I am all for that. We protect them by providing an effective check on every type of public service and giving the individual ready and easy access to the source of power. Whatever is said about local councils, when a constituent has a grievance he goes to where he thinks the power lies. Nine times out of ten he does not go to the local authority because he feels he is wasting his time, as he will be told that it is not the local authority's business and that he should go and see somebody else. In the end he goes to see the Member of Parliament at his "surgery". That is the situation we must put right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this job cannot be done merely by taking a little step. An abyss cannot be cleared in two jumps; it has to be cleared in one. The people I represent have been brought up in urban and rural areas, and they are a little worried about
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
the unitary system. But I would say, after seeing all the evidence and from my own experience, that effective local government can be achieved only through the unitary system. The Minister will have to use far more arguments than he has done in the past to convince me that the solution he is now proposing will be anything but a makeshift compromise and in the end unsatisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One thing puzzled me during the speech of my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Mr. Armstrong), which was a thoughtful speech, namely his repeated statement that one cannot clear an abyss in two jumps. I am confused about this matter and I must see him at one o'clock because I need an explanation. Everything else I understood. I think that the Minister should take care to read my hon. Friend's speech tomorrow, because although the Minister the other day, in answering me, was kind enough to remind the Committee that we should put our points briefly because we have a lot to get through, the fact is that this Bill is so complicated, dealing with the reorganisation of local government, that brevity for the moment must be put aside in order to do as the hon. Member for Durham, North-West has tried to do—to seek, by making a useful contribution, to tap and to probe the thinking and the attitude of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these early stages we must look at the principle, at the theme, at the thinking and see if we can get some response from the Minister. I notice that on the same day the Minister said that there was a substantial principle involved in the Government's proposals. He went on to say what the principle was not concerned with, in terms of priorities, and ended by saying that the principle was concerned with broad and humane government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later, my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) intervened, and I felt he made one of the most positive observations of the debate. I am pleased that the hon. Member has come in, because an honourable mention is always worth while, especially when made by the hon. Member for The Hartlepools. I quote from column 40:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman says. My approach is not on the question of tidiness but on actual participation and the use of services and the understanding of them."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
I was astounded to hear the Minister respond:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We can probably weave all that into our structure …"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Standing Committee D,</i> 25th November, 1971; 
	<i>c.</i> 40.]</p></blockquote>
A lot of weaving has taken place, but we want to be more certain of having participation and involvement in the structure. There is no question of the Committee's being satisfied by a possibility or probability of weaving in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can recall saying, both of Maud and of these proposals, possibly because of the difficulties I saw in each, "a plague on both their houses". I went on to say that Maud had been involved with a protracted examination of the problems of local government, and that after 181 sittings, and having considered the evidence of more than 2,000 witnesses, there was a good basis for discussion and examination of the final proposals for local government. The Minister, in his summing-up at our last Sitting, drew some unusual conclusions arising from Maud, as though we on this side had forgotten that the then Labour Government never had a Bill before the House, but a White Paper. The Minister's assertion that Maud was more disadvantageous than his own proposals falls to the ground. His Government had a White Paper in February of this year, and, as the Minister says, many changes have taken place since; 60 or more in the map in front of us as compared with the map produced then under Circular 8/71. The corollary of that is that he should not have charged this side of the Committee with an assertion that Maud was final, complete, a 
	<i>fait accompli,</i> and that the then Labour Government would have acted in exactly the same way as his own Government have acted. He should have left room for changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument now is in the area of the changes. As I said at the last Sitting, there has been insufficient discussion to get the changes we want, and insufficient time for local authorities to be able to examine in detail the implications of the proposals. The Government have been warned by local authority after local authority, up and down the country, by hon. Members on this side, in Committee and on Second Reading, that the Bill is a hotch-potch and a result of haste. The matter is of basic importance, and a matter of principle, and hon. Members opposite and the Minister must bear with us while we dwell on the principle at some length in order that we
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
might achieve the desired brevity at a later stage. We must, as I said earlier, tap the attitudes of the Government, seek out whether they intend to be in any way resilient, or whether they are prepared to modify their proposals or to remove themselves from the posture of rigidity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have three basic points. First, I assert that the Bill has been hastily prepared without the time necessary to prepare the provisions included in it, details of which should be contained in any Bill of this importance. It is proposed that wider powers be given to the Secretary of State, but we have not dwelt sufficiently upon the reliance which has been given to the exercise of these powers, which means that the Minister will be able to preside over a wide field of unresolved details—a situation to be resolved by regulations and orders outside the Bill. The haste in preparing the Bill in the first place has deprived us of an examination of the details, and there is a wide range of other matters involved in the Bill which will be dealt with outside of it by the application of regulations and orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has done it already. If I understood him aright on Second Reading, he has set up a Commission to discuss district boundaries with local authorities and districts. He did this at the end of the Second Reading debate, without any lawful authority from the House so to do. What constitutional authority has that Commission, until set up by the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) has raised an important point. I hope the Minister will take the opportunity of answering my hon. Friend's specific point, and of answering my point. Even at this stage we are concerned at the Government's intentions, and the extent to which the Government will apply regulations and orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second main theme is that the Bill seeks unnecessarily to alter not only the local government pattern of England and Wales, but also the actual geographical pattern of England itself. Presumably the ancient geographical counties are to be removed from the map, and people are to be expected to form and to accept entirely new geographical and sentimental affiliations which will be foreign to them,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
and unacceptable I have already suggested that so far as the authorities in Annex 1 to the Maud Report are concerned, and the provisions in Part 2 of the Schedule to the Bill under Tees-side, there are no traditional affiliations between the people in the North Riding and those north of the River Tees. It is clear that this is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only this morning I received a letter from the chairman of a council in the North Riding pointing out that he had seen my Amendment attempting to eradicate that situation from the Bill, and that chairman, on behalf of his council, writes that within the boundary devised by the Minister and his Government there is no traditional link between his parish and others in the North Riding with those bodies on Tees-side and north of the River Tees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third basic theme is that the Bill is discriminatory, flagrantly seeking to discriminate between certain towns and cities—by proposing to give them certain systems of local government—and other towns and cities which are similar in size, population and character. This discrimination is not likely to be acceptable, either in the short or the long terms, to those towns and cities given an inferior system of local government. The reference is to the difference between the powers and the functions of the metropolitan and non-metropolitan districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must take up these three matters. Whatever a Government tries to do, either in the direction of Maud, or in the direction of these proposals, it would be a fatal error to deny the importance of and the priorities involved in dealing with the character of people, their geographical position, the nature of their occupations, travel to work, characteristics, rural background, urban background, and traditional county areas. A reasonable system of local government could be brought about by longer discussions, because the Minister has behind him, as the Labour Government had behind them, a premium, in that there is a general desire throughout the country for the reorganisation of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we speak of reorganising local government, and accepting the need for 
	<div class='ob'></div> <!-- ob -->, we must bear in mind that at the end of the day it is the people who matter. Hon. Members have raised questions about the right kind of people to serve
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
on local government—"good men and women". Who is to decide who are the "right kind of people", and who is to decide who are "good men and women"? We are forgetting a fundamental basic principle, involving the notion of democracy as we understand it, the right of any man, or woman, to stand and represent the people in his or her community. It is the communities, by their vote, who will decide at the end of the day who is right for them and who is not right for them. It is pompous, and perhaps dangerously academic, for members of the Committee, or members of the House, to presume that they can get away with terms such as "the right kind of people" and "good men and women", and dodge at the same time how the test is to be applied. That we should not accept at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second danger which we must avoid when reorganising local government is failing to take into account people's habits and interests. It is a truth that the larger the authority in terms of local government, the more difficult to get the electorate to participate. In my own part of the world voting records, which are available, show that for the five years from 1961-1966 the average turn-out of electors for borough elections was of the order of 50.7 per cent., whereas in county elections during the same period there were no contests in 1964, and in 1961 a poll of 29.75 per cent. was achieved. We must be careful that when we talk in terms of size in local government we do not create, either intentionally or unintentionally, a unit of local government which is controlled by a kind of elite, or a kind of managerial society. We must not lose sight of the fact that freedom and liberty in this country depend on the ballot box, and that wherever the ballot box has been weakened, democracy has flown out of the window.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The largest unit of Government in this country is central Government. Where the interests of the nation are involved, and the precise interest of each individual with the right to vote, higher percentage turn-outs can be claimed. Local government involves more mundane questions, administration, education, social services, street cleaning and lighting, and the provision of housing; with so many multifarious considerations, the elector in the larger unit cannot have the same direct or personal interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a compromise between the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
proposals before us and the principle of the unitary authority. However, there is no compromise if the Government remain rigid. The only posture that can logically be taken from this side of the Committee is to support the principles of Maud, because the principles of Maud are the basis of some modification and examination of local government. I hope the Minister will respond far more favourably than he has done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A closing point. The Minister referred to Clause 140 and he made the claim that here was a means of providing more information for services. I again assert that Clause 140 is purely permissive, and that it does not place any obligation on local government to make known its services in the manner described by Clause 140. More than that, the Minister has said today that he is not prepared to direct local authorities to provide information on these services, and yet in the very field where there is a need for an obligation on authorities to provide services, the Minister is reticent, although his own Government in other respects direct local authorities—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman. I thought the Minister a little ill-advised to refer to that Clause in the first instance. We shall discuss it when we come to it, but we should not have a debate on it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are quite right, Sir Stephen. He was rather unfortunately advised—if he was advised at all—to raise the matter. But, having raised it, I briefly retort that it is illogical to place upon the Committee an attitude and a state of thinking which does not comply with the record of his own Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Minister must indicate at some point today—if not before one o'clock, when we convene again—so that we can get down to the brevity required on other details, whether the Government are prepared to be a little more resilient and receptive than they have been up to this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Lamond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter), I have been surprised and a little dismayed at the silence of the back-bench Members on the opposite side of the Committee. I hope, however, that the conspiracy of silence will be broken when we come to discuss
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
the boundaries of the proposed local authorities. Like every other member of the Committee, I have been deluged with letters, booklets and circulars of all kinds from local authorities who feel somewhat dismayed at the proposals in the Bill. I would suppose that hon. Gentlemen opposite who are more in touch with these local authorities than I am would find the time and the interest—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Hon. Members opposite are silent when they have an opportunity to speak. Could they not also be silent when other hon. Members are making speeches?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is perfectly entitled to draw my attention to any undue disorder in the Committee. I must say I had not noticed anything. If I notice any undue disorder, I shall certainly call the Committee to order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Stephen. There was a little more disorder than I had noticed earlier. However, I did not put it down to any disinterest in my own speech, but rather to the approach of one o'clock, which naturally tends to lead Members to gather up their papers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not feel qualified to carry the burden of trying to make the representations which all of those people who have written to me wish me to make. Hon. Members opposite should bear their fair share of the work in the Committee. No system of local government that we can devise will be perfect, and if hon. Members opposite are to take the point of view that the Bill represents perfection in local government, they should have second thoughts on serving on the Committee. We are here to examine the Bill, to listen to the points that any hon. Member cares to make on any local authority, and to consider whether or not there is a good case. Among those who have written to us, some may have a very good case which has been overlooked, perhaps by both sides, in drawing up the various proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had some experience in local authority work, in what one might call a unitary authority—a fairly large authority—administering services for a population approaching 200,000 people, and responsible for most services, including police, with some services on the basis of a larger unit—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
