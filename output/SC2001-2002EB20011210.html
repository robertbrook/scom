	<i>[Relevant Documents: Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Reports of the European Scrutiny Committee, HC 152-vi, vii and viii (2001–02).]</i></p>

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Crewe and Nantwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Griffiths. The motion states that the Committee "takes note" of the document under scrutiny, but I understand from external sources that the Government's attitude is that we should accept it. Are there different interpretations of the phrase in the motion? It simply implies that the House of Commons study the implications—or is there a mistake in the motion's wording?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have in front of me a copy of the wording, which states that the Committee "takes note" of the document and says nothing about accepting it. That is the motion, and that is the procedure that we will follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wells)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order made by the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), Mr. Griffiths. Paragraph 1.15 of the eighth report by the European Scrutiny Committee states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We consider these issues to be of sufficient gravity to be debated on the Floor of the House and so recommend."</p></blockquote>
That suggests that not only is a "takes note" motion inadequate, but the Government have defied the Committee's recommendation and are not granting such a debate. The Amsterdam and Nice treaties provide that national Governments must give greater priority to national Parliaments in considering European business. Is it in order for the Government to defy that requirement and the European Scrutiny Committee's recommendation by not assenting to a full debate on the Floor of the House about such an important issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obviously not party to any proposals for a debate on the Floor of the House, but I imagine that that would be settled through the usual channels. I have not heard of any specific request for such a debate, and the order is before us in Committee. I appreciate that the European Scrutiny Committee recommended that the debate be held on the Floor of the House, but I do not know whether a concerted effort was made through the usual channels to ensure that it was held in this Committee. The issue was not
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
raised at last week's aborted sitting, so I am minded to continue with the proceedings and the form of business of that sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Bob Ainsworth) for the letter that he sent after last week's sitting, and I am grateful for the letter from Clare Checksfield. We are entirely happy with their explanation, and I hope that that deals with the matter that brought last week's proceedings to an end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On today's proceedings, I have a copy of a note from the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting last week. It is in French, which happily I can read, so I do not have a major problem. However, can the Minister tell us whether the document exists in English, and if so, whether hon. Members can have a copy of it? Whether the document is in French or in English, would it not be sensible for the Minister to summarise briefly the decisions taken by the Council last week? Things have moved on since we met a week ago, and it may help us to start by knowing where we are, because we may not have the relevant documents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Surrey Heath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Griffiths. I echo the comments of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) about matters having moved on, and I associate the official Opposition with his acceptance of the explanations about last week's proceedings. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) that, in the light of developments at last week's Council, the debate should take place on the Floor of the House. Our proceedings have already been aborted once, and I hope that the Minister will explain why the matter has not been transferred to the House for debate, as the European Scrutiny Committee recommended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maples 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to strike a discordant note, but I am not happy with the explanation about what happened last week. It is extraordinary that a Minister should come before a Committee on such an incredibly important piece of European legislation, which will take long-standing rights away from United Kingdom citizens, and not have the correct document in front of him. I do not know whose fault it was. The explanation indicates that some poor civil servant was made to carry the can for the mistake, but the Minister should have been sufficiently on top of his job to know which was the proper document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is important, because the Justice and Home Affairs Council intended to sign the matter off over the weekend. Luckily for the Government, the Italian Government balked, and the decision has now been postponed until next weekend. If everything had gone according to plan, our debate would have been superfluous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like clarification on what the Italian Government decided. If they are going to veto the document, we might as well pack up, go home and not waste our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
time. We are probably wasting our time anyway, because the Government do not take note of our discussions about such "takes note" motions. However, clarification is essential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have got things off our chest now. We received an explanation about how everything was not perfect in the rush to prepare the papers for the Committee. We are all human, and we must accept that such things will happen occasionally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me explain how I intend to proceed, in case some Members present are not happy with that. At our previous sitting, a motion to adjourn was agreed because the Committee did not have the same papers as the Minister. Members thought that they had the wrong papers and the Minister had the right ones; for once, it was the other way round. We should start proceedings afresh with this sitting. We have two and a half hours. After the Minister makes his statement, there will be questions up to half-past 5. No doubt, given the points of order and the issues that have already been raised, there will be an opportunity for the Minister to say something about the wider issues. The questions raised in the points of order could also be put after the Minister's statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A tradition in the House is that civil servants who cannot answer back are not named in proceedings. I do not know the procedure for removing names from 
	<i>Hansard,</i> but, if it is possible, the person concerned should not be named. Such errors are the responsibility of Ministers—their backs are broad enough to take the kind of attack that they receive from fellow politicians—and I hope that we will not make a habit of naming specific civil servants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we can remove the reference from the proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.39 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Bob Ainsworth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will understand, from the context of the debate, why I am not completely pleased to appear in front of it again. An error was made; it was entirely my responsibility, as has been said, and I have apologised for it. Neither the Committee nor any of the Clerks who serve the Committee were at fault. There is not much more that I can do if hon. Members find that explanation unacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maples</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not give way. I am making my opening remarks, after which there will be a question and answer session, when the hon. Gentleman can say what he likes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members are content, I shall not repeat my opening remarks at last week's sitting, but simply update the Committee on the stage that the European arrest warrant negotiations have reached, before taking questions. Before doing so, in view of what happened last week, let us check that we are discussing document COPEN 65, of 31 October. That is the most recently deposited document, but a more recent
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
version of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant was considered last week at the Justice and Home Affairs Council and was further updated. No completely English text is available yet on the latest situation, but as hon. Members are aware, there has been movement and some changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will find, for example, that the reservations that they expressed about the definition of judicial authorities and the conditions in which a European arrest warrant will be executed in the case of a conviction in absentia are answered in the new text. We shall examine that during the question session and the debate thereafter. The Government's position—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maples</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Griffiths. Are we now being told that there is a subsequent text to the one that was agreed last week? We are considering a document to which the Minister now tells us further changes were made over the weekend, and we do not have that version. The Home Office is treating the Committee in an absolutely appalling way. How can we debate this matter properly before the Laeken summit if we do not have the latest version of the paper?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Griffiths. We are attempting to scrutinise on-going negotiations. Inevitably, at the time when we consider the papers, we can consider only the latest version that we have. We hope that we will be fully informed about the latest stage of negotiations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Griffiths. The House of Commons considers the wording that is placed before it. Whatever examination of European laws takes place outside this Parliament is only tangential. The Minister has specifically said this afternoon that there is a subsequent version of the papers that we are considering. We have also been told that they are available in French, but not in English. As you know, Mr. Griffiths, a rule of the House says that we may not use the French language, apart from certain defined Norman French terms, which are available to members of the Chairmen's Panel and to all others. Are we now being told that the answers to specific and vital questions about phrases such as "judicial responsibility" are not to be found in the English text before us, but in a French text that is not available to the Committee? If so, I do not see how we can continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Griffiths.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I say something before we lose more time on points of order? The Committee has been convened on the basis of the motion on the Order Paper. As I understand it, there were discussions at the weekend that might materially change the document before us, but at this point in time, a new document does not exist. There is a note of the meeting in which some changes are recorded, to which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has referred. The Minister was trying to be helpful by giving us an idea of some of the issues that came up at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
the meeting, but it is not possible to go beyond the terms of the motion and have the broader discussion that the Minister is introducing in his statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members wish, they may continue discussion after the sitting through the usual channels. At the moment, we are considering the document on which the Minister is supplying further information. Another document does not exist and, given how European Union negotiations work, may not have existed even after next weekend. We must work on what we have and any other information that the Minister has, which is not part of an official EU document at this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Maples first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maples</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last week, you ruled differently on a similar issue, Mr. Griffiths. When the Minister did not have the correct papers, you ruled that the Committee should adjourn. We are now told that a new version of the text exists, not that amendments were discussed during the weekend. Therefore, we are debating a version of the text that will not go to Europe next weekend. A new version, which even the Minister does not have, apparently exists and will go before the Justice and Home Affairs Council. It is inappropriate that we debate a document overtaken by events. We should discuss the latest version of the document, which will go before the JHA Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us get one thing clear: as I understand it, there is no new document. The Minister did not mention one; he said that, following this sitting, some changes would be made that are not yet fully defined. I may be corrected, but there is no new document to discuss. The one before us is the only one. Some proposals in it have not yet been finalised as a new document. At this stage, we can take note of the document before us. Members can put their feelings about the negotiating process on the record, and can go through the usual channels if they require further action. We are considering a proposal—with possible amendments that the Minister will tell us about—and we should get on with it so that the Committee can debate the matter further. If necessary, Members can pursue it after the Committee's proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have sought earnestly to be helpful, Mr. Griffiths. However, the House always works on the latest document available: proposed legislation is considered as amended. As the Minister informed us, the last ministerial Council in Brussels came to some conclusions, and it is those—the amendments to the text dated 31 October—which will form the basis of next weekend's discussions at ministerial Council level. We must have the latest document, but we do not. For that reason I, propose that the Committee adjourn until it is available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Griffiths. With respect, you referred to discussions and negotiations, but reference has been made to a text. I have been in the Minister's position of negotiating for this country, and written amendments are immediately available—one thing the European Council can do is push out paper. A written version is available of what was discussed, agreed and amended at the Justice and Home Affairs Council at the end of last week. That text exists but we do not have it. We are, therefore, proceeding on the basis of an out-of-date text. I submit that we adjourn until an up-to-date version is available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The French document that I obtained is the provisional minute of the JHA Council meeting. It contains a list of participants and an agenda. According to the minute, the item that we are discussing was first on the agenda. I have a one-page minute of the decision to which 14 member states agreed, but one state did not. Three points were minuted as relevant. I have not seen the document, amended or original, although I do not dispute the fact that one may exist. There is certainly a minute in French of what happened last week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Griffiths, I repeat what I said before that outburst of points of order: there was further updating at the JHA Council meeting, but no new English text exists on the latest situation. [HON. MEMBERS: "What about the French one?"] As was pointed out, it is out of order with the House's rules to table documents in foreign languages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are losing the purpose of the sitting. Let us remember that we are meeting to consider documents that were put before the European Scrutiny Committee. I sought an adjournment of proceedings last week not because we did not have the correct documents, but because the Minister did not have them. As the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Maples) may remember, he asked a question about article 2(3), and it turned out that that paragraph was not in the Minister's document. I felt that we could not proceed, and a motion to adjourn was agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, every Member has the document that was considered by the Scrutiny Committee. We know that further discussions have taken place in the European Union, but we know, and must accept, that the document to which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey referred is a minute of the meeting, not a new or amended document. It was a minute of a meeting from which a new document may at some stage be produced. It is our job to examine the document that we have. As I said, if substantial changes occur by next week and hon. Members want to take the matter further through questions, debate and the usual channels, that is a matter for the House as a whole. In this Committee, we should examine this document, take up any point that the Minister raises in his statement for the elucidation and help of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Committee, and continue with our work. If there are problems, they must be dealt with elsewhere and afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Under the Standing Orders of the Committee—I think that it is No. 35—I do not think it appropriate to accept the dilatory motion.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Griffiths. As Opposition spokesman, I associate myself with the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and my hon. Friends the Members for Stratford-on-Avon and for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson). We find ourselves in an unusual position, which arises from the understandable adjournment of last week's Committee. There have been subsequent developments, and the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has said that, although he referred to only a minute of last weekend's meeting in French and we do not have a translation, the minute may refer to a document. His French minute is not clear one way or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our problem is that if the Committee proceeds today and a new document comes into existence, as the Minister said may happen, there is no provision for the matter to come back before Committee. This "takes note" motion is a one-off opportunity, which is why I strongly support my hon. Friends in their suggestion that the right moment for such a motion would be when a further document comes into existence. At least we would know the final document that will be considered by the heads of state at the Council of Ministers. Only then will the House of Commons be able to do its full job as recommended by the European Scrutiny Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even last week's aborted sitting was useful, because Members had the opportunity to raise questions, for which the Minister was trying to provide answers in his statement, about what might arise from the further discussions in the European Union. The hon. Gentleman's point of order was really an attempt to ask the Government how they will deal with the matter later owing to developments on the European scene. I cannot predict what the Government will do, but at some point they may come back to the European Scrutiny Committee and this Committee with a final version of the document. Today, we are considering the version that was final until the weekend. The Minister is trying to be helpful by telling us something about that meeting. There is not yet a new document and so I suggest that hon. Members use the rest of the time to ask probing questions to see whether they can find out more about what arose last week and to give the Government a good idea of what they would like to see in the final version of the document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am more than happy to try to go down the route suggested if that is what the Committee wishes. I can come to the Committee only on the basis of the document that we were asked to put under scrutiny, not on a subsequent document that has not yet been translated. I am aware of discussions that have taken place, as are other hon. Members. I am simply making hon. Members aware that some of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
concerns that they flagged up will be satisfied in a new text when it is available. It would be a waste of time to stick strictly to COPEN 65 as everyone knows that we are dealing with a moving situation. We ought to try to use the scrutiny provisions that are provided by the House as best we can so that hon. Members can know the British Government's position and how far our negotiations have progressed. I am happy to try to facilitate that, but I can put only the basics in place on top of the latest English document that I have received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point made by one Opposition Member that if the meeting had not been blocked at the weekend this Committee would have been a total waste of time is not true. Our position before last weekend was that we would put in a scrutiny reserve because we had not managed to speak properly in the Committee. The Government's position, subject to a UK scrutiny reserve on the whole text pending clearance by Parliament, remains that we support the European arrest warrant, based on the abolition of dual criminality for all extraditable offences—those with a maximum sentence of at least 12 months—with the exception only for conduct that is carried out in the UK and is not an offence here, and possibly for abortion and euthanasia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will be aware from reports in the press that the European arrest warrant did not obtain agreement at the JHA Council last week. The latest position on this is as follows. Italy wanted the European arrest warrant to be limited to terrorism, by which it meant that the scope should encompass only the first six offences on the list. Despite strong pressure from the Belgian presidency, the Italian Government could not be persuaded to accept the European arrest warrant in broadly the form on the table. The Belgian Prime Minister, Guy Verhofstadt, is visiting Rome tomorrow and I have no doubt that the European arrest warrant will be further discussed then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although third-pillar JHA measures have to be agreed with unanimity, there is a provision in the treaty on the European Union for a measure to go ahead among the majority of states, provided that that is agreed unanimously. I have every hope that a deal will be agreed to enable the European arrest warrant to be accepted, either at or before the meeting of the Heads of Government at Laeken on Friday. The Govt will press hard for that outcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>rose</i>—</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We now have until 5.30 to ask questions. There have been a large number of points of order, so although doing so would eat into the debating time, I shall use my discretion to allow questions to run beyond then. I therefore remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and asked one at a time. Last time, we had reached the second round when the problem occurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister read for us the English translation of "judicial authority" from which the Government are working?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not read a translation from French. I do not know what point my hon. Friend wishes to raise. If she wishes to raise the issue of the authority by which an arrest warrant will be implemented either in an issuing state—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to know what it means. What does judicial authority mean to Her Majesty's Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tried to give my hon. Friend that assurance last week. The only people who will be allowed to issue or execute an arrest warrant will be a judicial authority as recognised normally within either the issuing or the executing state.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I ask again, what is the definition of "judicial authority"? An answer in any language that I can vaguely understand will do, and I speak five.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The definition of a "judicial authority" is exactly that. In this country, it is the Bow street magistrates court. In other countries, there are various different authorities such as magistrates and judges who normally issue extradition warrants. Those are the people who will execute a European arrest warrant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maples</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister about the point that caused the Committee to adjourn last week, which is the meaning of article 2(3). My understanding is that paragraph (2) details offences for which dual criminality is not required. Paragraph (3) seems to imply that dual criminality would be required in those cases, and article 4(1) cites cases in which the extraditing country can refuse to extradite. The words at the end of paragraph article 2(3) troubled me, and they were not in his text. If it ended at:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the law of the executing State"</p></blockquote>
it would be perfectly clear, but it continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"where the acts were committed fully or partly on the territory of the executing State."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister explain what those words are intended to add or detract from the general wording of paragraph (3)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, the text to which we are working is dated 31 October. Discussions have taken place since then. Changes have been made—there were already some changes last week, hence the confusion. He touched on an important point. The framework decision is still being negotiated. We are pressing for discretionary grounds for the refusal of a European arrest warrant where the offence is committed wholly or in part in the territory of the executing state, or where it occurs outside the territory of the requesting state and where the executing state does not claim extraterritorial jurisdiction over the conduct in question. That would effectively eliminate the words in COPEN 65 that so concerned the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>David Cairns 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister a question that relates to my query from last week about those few conditions
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
whereby the executing state may refuse to comply with the arrest warrant, because of moral reasons in the broadest sense of the term. Article 2(4) refers to acts relating to
	<br><blockquote><p>"abortion, euthanasia, morality, sexuality, or freedom of expression and association."</p></blockquote>
As I understand my hon. Friend's opening statement, that list has been reduced to abortion and euthanasia. Is that correct, and if so, what was the thinking that led to the removal of morality, sexuality and freedom of expression and association?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: During negotiations, member states took the position that they wanted the discretion to continue to apply dual criminality. We do not believe that there will be a problem in the case of abortion and euthanasia. However, the British Government's position is that we shall reflect on concerns that have been expressed in Parliament and try to ensure that that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a framework document. There is no requirement on the British Government to abolish dual criminality for cases of abortion or euthanasia. If we seek to abolish dual criminality in those cases, we will need to make certain when we enact the document, which we shall do in primary legislation in the House of Commons, that we justify that to the House. Before we introduce primary legislation, we shall reflect on the concerns that have been raised. Nothing in the framework document makes us abolish dual criminality in those cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that under article 39 of the European Union treaty, the Council must consult the European Parliament before adopting measures governed by article 34, and it has consulted that Parliament on this proposal. It does not have a co-decision power but a consultative function. On 9 September—I think that that is right—the European Parliament made a recommendation following a Committee deliberation that called on the Council
	<br><blockquote><p>"to adopt a framework decision establishing measures governing and guaranteeing the implementation of a 'European search and arrest warrant' with a view to combating terrorism in the context of action against crime, whether organised or not, trafficking in human beings and crimes against children, illegal trafficking in drugs and arms, and corruption and fraud, taking due account, in the event of more than one offence having been committed, of the gravity of each offence."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister say why, at this stage, the proposal is, as we understand it, significantly wider than the European Parliament's recommendation and whether it could be limited to that sort of range of crimes? Some areas of controversy, such as that raised a moment ago by the hon. Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (David Cairns) and the ones raised last week on environmental crime and high-tech crime—those have very wide definitions—might be able to be dealt with if the arrest warrant were limited to that family of terrorism-related crimes and the ones recommended by the European Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that decision, and the hon. Gentleman must be aware that two issues bear on the question that he asks. Those issues have been discussed in connection with other legislation that is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
going through the House. It is difficult to separate out issues such as terrorism, because terrorist organisations are often involved in other crime. That may be one reason why, in some aspects, the proposal is broad. The British Government are prepared—this is a long-standing position—to abolish dual criminality for a very wide range of offences. The extension beyond that originally discussed has not been and is not a problem from our point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for updating us on the progress made on article 2(3). In his clarification, he said that it had been provisionally agreed that in the case of a crime committed outside the territory of the issuing country, the order for the arrest warrant could be refused unless the issuing country claimed extraterritorial rights. Will the Minister advise the Committee on when, whether by custom or regulation, such extraterritorial rights might be claimed? Would the crimes be particularly serious, and is it for the issuing country to decide?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall advise the Committee. I have already tried to advise the Committee on the issue that was raised by the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon, which I believe will be dealt with in any ensuing text, that no executing state will be required to deliver a person under a European extradition warrant for crimes committed in that state or in a separate country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the need to abolish dual criminality, there was broad agreement from the other 14 states—with the exception of Italy, with which negotiations broke down altogether—to raise the threshold from one year to three years. A European arrest warrant would still apply to offences above a 12-month threshold, but a state would be required to abolish dual criminality unless the offence carried a sentence of at least three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The draft is clear: a British citizen can be extradited to face trial for offences that are not crimes in this country if they are in listed in article 2(2). Article 22 builds on that and allows the issuing state to prosecute, sentence or detain an individual for offences other than the offence for which the original warrant was issued. There appears to be no limit, so the issuing country could extradite a British citizen and change the alleged crime, which is very serious. Was that discussed, and are the British Government required to limit that? There could be no end to the offences that British citizens could face once they had been extradited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. There is a requirement that British citizens could be extradited to face charges that are not crimes in this country. However, the reverse of that is that German citizens would not be allowed to break British law. They could not come to Great Britain, break the law and be exempt from an extradition warrant to face the law in this country. Unless the right hon. Gentleman wants to apply a dual standard, he must accept that one is the corollary of the other. If we want criminals from European states to face justice for crimes committed in this country against UK law, we
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
must be prepared to accept that the same will happen to British citizens who break the law in other European states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know the right hon. Gentleman's view on that, or whether he thinks that some dual standard should be applied or that it is all right for a German or Frenchman to come to Great Britain and break the law. Where dual criminality is abolished and we accept mutual recognition, specialty is abolished with it. A person would be sent back to another European state to face criminal charges—but only if dual criminality were abolished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister certain that anyone tried in absentia would not be returned to another state without a cast iron guarantee of a proper retrial, or is this another of the rather vague definitions that we are expected to take in good faith?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been some discussion about COPEN 65 since it was issued. It has been agreed that future texts will guarantee a retrial if a person is absent from an original trial, and contain safeguards for the rights of the defence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, exactly what is entailed in the list of potential offences in article 2(2)? On fraud and the financial interests of the European Community, is the Minister aware that every year the Court of Auditors fails to approve the budget of the European Union? Will the provisions be used to extradite officials? Secondly, is not xenophobia a passive condition? It is not a transitive condition, but something from which people suffer. How is a fear of strangers a criminal offence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's first point, fraud is a serious offence and the authorities will be able to issue a European arrest warrant for fraud. I see no problem with that. On xenophobia, he should be aware that crimes associated with race hate in this country would fall under that heading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister consider that it is correct for line 2 of article 2(1) to refer to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a custodial sentence or a detention order of a maximum of at least twelve months"?</p></blockquote>
In view of the Minister's earlier comments, should that not read a minimum of 12 months?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should have been a minimum of 12 months. As a result of further negotiations, the requirement to abolish dual criminality is now three years, but the point at which a European arrest warrant becomes available is still a minimum of a 12-month sentence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Cameron 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Witney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister three quick questions. Whatever happens with the arrest warrant and the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Bill, which we will debate on the Floor of the House later this week, is there a guarantee that the arrest warrant will be incorporated into UK law not via the accelerated third pillar procedures in clause 109
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
of the Bill, but separately through a future extradition Bill? I believe that we have that guarantee, but I would be grateful for confirmation. Secondly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is one question, and hon. Members should ask one at a time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is our intention to introduce an extradition Bill that will incorporate not only the issues of the European arrest warrant, but our relations with countries that are not in the EU. As hon. Members will know, we have an antiquated system of extradition. Heavily contested cases take years, and justice can be denied to victims. We need to modernise our procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>John Cryer 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To return to the question of xenophobia, which is cited in article 2, the Minister referred to race hate crimes on the statute book in this country. However, in answer to a question asked by Lord Pearson of Rannoch on 29 November, Lord Rooker said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The term "racism and xenophobia" as listed in Article 2 of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant is a generic description. It is a decision for the issuing state as to how it frames the offence under its national law when it makes a request under a European arrest warrant."—[
	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 29 November 2001; Vol. 629, c. 60W.]</p></blockquote>
That indicates that the legislation will vary from country to country, because it will be affected by existing law. If a member of the European Union decided that xenophobia—in most people's books it is not racism but something different—included particularly virulent criticism of the European Union, a judge could sign an arrest warrant and somebody could be arrested the following day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In theory, that is true, but my hon. Friend must accept that our European partners cannot issue a European arrest warrant unless the crime is punishable by a minimum sentence of 12 months in their country. Yes, other countries have crimes under the category of xenophobia that this country does not. However, the basic principle is whether and to what extent we are prepared to trust our European neighbours, all of which are signatories to the European convention on human rights, and to allow justice to be secured—in the other country, if not in this one—if a crime is committed in another European country. The return for that is that the same thing will apply to the citizens of other countries who come here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are still members of the EU that will not extradite their nationals to this country. People increasingly move between countries, and travel is becoming easier as well as more common. It is not acceptable that someone can escape justice for crimes committed in this country by simply moving abroad. However, if we are to require extradition in the one direction, we must be prepared to give it in the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Pursuing that point, we on the Opposition Benches believe strongly that the first duty of any British Government is to protect the rights of
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
their citizens who are innocent. My question is further to the Minister's comments in our previous abortive debate:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are trying to get away from that antiquated approach because it leads constantly to arguments, delays and repeat judicial reviews of cases—and years before anyone can be extradited."—[
	<i>Official Report, European Standing Committee B,</i> 3 December 2001; c. 9.]</p></blockquote>
People who are absolutely innocent may be accused by some foreign judicial authority, such as a magistrate on the island of Sicily who is under the control of the Mafia. We are not prepared to trust such a judicial authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is good that Italy has so far vetoed the proposal. However, if the Minister says that such issues normally require unanimity but that it will not require unanimity if all the other members agree to go ahead, a word means what we want it to mean, and we are in an Alice in Wonderland world. Will the Minister accept that there are serious concerns about accepting so-called judicial authorities? He should understand by now the huge concern in this country, highlighted by the current case of the UK plane-spotters in prison in Greece.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is an absolute first order that Governments try to protect their citizens. A great amount of travel takes place in the European Union, including into this country. One has only to travel on the motorway or the underground to see European citizens who move among us every day. I do not understand how the hon. Gentleman could imagine that allowing those citizens to remain beyond our justice system is in the interests of protecting our citizens. We cannot expect countries to return people who have committed crimes against British citizens to face justice in this country if we are not prepared to reciprocate. The hon. Gentleman refers to "some foreign" judicial authority, but we are talking about EU members, all of which are signed up to the European convention on human rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise if I was not clear about unanimity. Although unanimity is required on third-pillar matters, the hon. Gentleman should know that if one state opts out and is happy for everyone else to go ahead, it can agree to that. That has happened before and it might in this case, if the Italian Government are happy for the other 14 states to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have several concerns, and I am not a lawyer, so I listen with interest to those who are. My hon. Friend makes much of the process of easing the extradition of people who have later committed crimes in other European countries. That may not be too difficult in cases of joint criminality. However, if that is not the case, I am concerned about extradition. My hon. Friend has not been absolutely clear about cases such as abortion and euthanasia.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to satisfy my hon. Friend. Abortion and euthanasia issues are not raised by the framework document. Under the terms of the document, we can continue to apply dual criminality in those areas. We can address that through primary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
legislation, and under the framework document we can decide whether to maintain dual criminality. It is clearly agreed in the text that dual criminality does not have to be abolished in those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked whether it is fair to move people around and create a justice system outside dual criminality areas. I have dealt with extradition cases since I became a Home Office Minister. Dual criminality is used constantly to question, delay and prevent extradition. Proving an exact correlation between a crime committed in this country and its translation into German or French law often provides a field day for lawyers and the judiciary. Some cases take years. If we trust our neighbours, all of which have signed up to the ECHR, we must accept their legal systems, and accordingly the abolition of dual criminality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Minister's attention to article 15, which states that there shall be one appeal against a decision to extradite. The Minister knows that in our system appeals run from a divisional court, to the High Court, the Court of Appeal and, in complicated cases, the House of Lords. Will the accused be able to pick only one appeal? That would demolish an important judicial safeguard, particularly if it were allied to article 17, which says that the entire process must be compressed into 30 days. A complicated asylum seeker case would have to go through all the necessary appeals within 30 days. Will the Minister say whether articles 15 and 17 remain in the draft and have not been changed, and will he clarify the Government's attitude towards them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our position is that in England the Bow Street magistrates court should continue to be the issuing judicial authority, and that there should be one appeal against its decision. The order now provides for 90 days to deal with such cases, and endless repetitious appeals and judicial reviews are part of the problem that we face with the current system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of my hon. Friend's earlier reply, will he make it clear that, if the framework decision on a European arrest warrant is accepted and all the other member states subsequently agree to expand the crimes on the list to include acts such as euthanasia and abortion, this country would still retain the right to refuse to apply that secondary list? If, as he appeared to tell us earlier, the Government's attitude is that they do not want to maintain such reserves, will that mean that the European Court of Justice could override the House of Commons?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no requirement for the abolition of dual criminality in the European framework decision in respect of abortion or euthanasia. Whether we abolish dual criminality for such acts is a matter for Parliament. We have reflected on views that have been expressed to us. We do not believe that it will be an issue, but if we are convinced that we must protect against it, we will be free to do so. We will not be required to abolish dual criminality in those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that if the framework decision is agreed at the Laeken summit, it must be passed into law by the end of 2002. The Minister said in writing to the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) and me that the Government's intention is that extradition matters will be governed by primary legislation which will be introduced next year. Will the UK Parliament be free to amend the proposal in the directive so that if, for example, the environmental or high-tech crime provisions were thought to be too wide, they could be narrowed or, if we wanted, we could exclude xenophobia? If Parliament amended the provisions, what would be the result?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we sign up to the framework document, the UK Parliament will not be free to introduce legislation that does not comply or, therefore, remove crimes from the list for the abolition of dual criminality. As I said, since the document that is before the Committee was issued, a three-year minimum sentence for the requirement to abolish dual criminality has also been agreed. We will be required to extradite for crimes on the list that carry at least a three-year sentence in the issuing state. In bringing this legislation into being in the UK Parliament, we will not be allowed to break the terms of the framework. I told my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich that it is clear from the discussions that have taken place since 31 October that there will be no such requirement on abortion and euthanasia. We will be totally free in those areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for his clarifications. He is persuading me that the measures proposed would help to speed up the prosecution of serious criminals. Will he confirm that there have been more cases in recent years of people seeking to evade British justice by not being deported back to Britain to face the courts than the other way around? We stand to gain more than we would lose by this in terms of bringing suspects to justice in Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is quite the case. They are in roughly equal numbers. Somewhere in my folder I have the numbers, which I could give to my hon. Friend. I shall try to dig them out before we get to the debate. Over the past 10 years there has been a relatively small increase in extradition. Broadly, we apply for similar numbers as are applied for against us. Britain is not an easy country from which to extradite; the cases can be spun out for years and many fail as a result. I am certain that many applications are not even made because of the difficulties that arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The draft directive was promoted by the Government on the basis that it was a response to terrorism. Does the Minister think that it has the right priorities in those circumstances? For example, does he believe that the illicit trafficking in cultural goods, swindling or the forgery of administrative documents merit extradition? Has he thought of the implications of the terrorist provisions for the United States of America? Does not the European convention on human rights preclude EU member states from extraditing to the US terrorist suspects whom the

	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
Americans believe are guilty of heinous offences such as those committed on 11 September? Is that the right sense of priorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. This was not conceived in response to 11 September. It was around a long time before that. We issued a consultation document on extradition, to which all hon. Members could respond. Yes, it acquired a degree of urgency as a result of the events of 11 September. We propose to bring forward primary legislation to modernise all our extradition arrangements. I know that this offends the hon. Gentleman deeply, but the modernisation of our arrangements with our EU partners will have to be within the framework of this document if it is agreed. We plan to bring forward legislation relating to the US and all our other extradition partners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cameron</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the plane-spotting case, which has obviously been in the press a great deal, is it not possible in this directive to build in some maximum period between arrest, incarceration and subsequent charge? That has been the problem with the Greek case, and nothing in the document appears to reflect that. At the last meeting, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"when the trial is to be held in Europe, we should not be looking under every stone to find out how it may allegedly be inadequate."—[
	<i>Official Report, European Standing Committee B,</i> 3 December 2001; c. 3.]</p></blockquote>
In the light of the Greek case, should we not be "looking under every stone"? Is the Minister suggesting that if another 12 plane-spotters go to Greece and do what the original 12 plane-spotters did, and are not arrested there but come back to the UK, they would be extradited on the authority of the Greek police—in collaboration with the correct judicial authority in the UK—without him wanting to look under every stone? Is that not the problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Remand is not always dealt with expeditiously in this country either. Many British citizens, as well as people who have been extradited from abroad, are kept on remand for a considerable time, sometimes at the request of the defence. The hon. Gentleman may say that people are kept on remand for a long time in other member states, but that also happens in the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Article 2 lists several offences for which the dual criminality rule is to be abolished. In other words, the individual can be extradited even for an act that is not a crime in this country. Those offences include environmental crime, high-tech crime, and swindling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Swindling is not an offence under British law. A "swindler" is a term of abuse, but it does not have precision or legal meaning. If a requesting state demands extradition, who is to decide whether the offence comes under the general term "swindling"? Which judicial authority will decide whether the individual can be taken against his or her will to face charges in a foreign state for which there is no corresponding offence in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister began his statement at 4.39 pm and questions ended officially at 5.39 pm. I have allowed them to continue under Standing Order No. 119 as there appear to be a few more, and I shall take those before we begin the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be for the issuing authority to frame the European arrest warrant. In this country, crimes committed under the Theft Act could be covered by the generic term "swindling", but the crime would have to carry a sentence of at least 12 months in the issuing state. If that state framed a warrant in that way, it could apply for extradition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put a hypothetical case to the Minister. If some of my constituents went to Spain and came back, the Spanish authorities wanted to extradite them, a warrant was issued from a Spanish court for their extradition and they were picked up in this country, what safeguards would they know they had from then on, and where would they find them? What legal advice, legal aid and translation and interpretation of every stage would they have? When would they know when they were to be charged, brought before a court or dealt with in another way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They would be taken in front of Bow Street magistrates court and would be advised of their rights to a defence before that happened. They could make a case for their not being returned, although the reasons for which extradition could be refused would be limited. All the safeguards would be in place in respect of rights to consent or otherwise in the return and would be made known to the person on arrest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would happen when they got back to Spain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, the question is to what, if any, extent we intend to trust our partners' judicial systems. Should the French authority decide whether a French person who is returned to this country to face judicial activity needs to be protected in that by the French? To what degree should we insist that that takes place in return? We do not believe that we need to oversee the operations of the judicial authorities of our European partners, which have signed the ECHR.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may recall that last week I raised privately with him the definition of territoriality in relation to the internet. Let us suppose that I am a British neo-Nazi attempting to promote a Nazi revival in Germany and I draft a website in German aimed at the German market. Would I be committing an offence on German territory even if I did not physically visit that country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The law is developing in that regard, so what would happen in such a situation is not completely clear. However, I can say that the requirement on extra-territoriality means that someone would have to go to Germany and break the law there to be extraditable. If the crime were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
committed in the United Kingdom, there would not be a requirement to extradite in the circumstances outlined by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cameron</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister about the one-appeal rule, which I think will create the strange anomaly of British citizens having fewer rights in respect of appeals than non-EU nationals in, for example, a deportation case. In the Adan 
	<i>v.</i> Aitseguer case, the UK was trying to deport Algerian nationals to Germany, because they were illegal immigrants. The case went all the way to the House of Lords, which ruled that because the Germans interpreted the ECHR more narrowly than the UK, those people should not be deported. The courts ruled that we have a better—if people want to say that—interpretation of the ECHR than Germany, because the case reached the House of Lords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the one-appeal rule, however, any of our constituents will have only one appeal, and the judgment will not be able to be made that the interpretation of the ECHR in Greece, Spain or anywhere else in Europe is not as rigorous as in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us turn the example around. If a German commits a crime in this country, he will have all the rights of the British judicial system to appeal up to the top court in the land against the decision that was taken at his trial. We need to examine whether he should be allowed to exercise all those rights in Germany before he comes here and then exercise them again where he is here. If someone comes to this country and commits a crime, he should face justice here, and the reverse also applies. The question is not of people having fewer rights than others, but of where they exercise those rights. In the case that I have suggested, the rights would be exercised in the UK, where the crime was committed, and not in Germany, from where the person came.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 13425/01,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Draft Council Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant and the Surrender Procedures between the Member States; and supports the Government's active participation in the debate on the draft Framework Decision and the Government's intention to ensure that extradition within the European Union takes place on the basis of the principles of mutual recognition.— 
	<i>[Mr. Bob Ainsworth.]</i></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>5.49 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition disagree with the Government's stance. The Minister has received little support and faced tough questions from Labour Members. He sought to imply what the rest of us think, and he must realise that he does not have much support from any party in the Committee. Despite the
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
fact that one of his hon. Friends said that he was starting to be persuaded, several of them obviously share our reservations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reservations expressed about the EU arrest warrant proposal are by no means restricted to Conservative Members. In the other place, a range of Lords have savagely criticised the proposal and pointed out many of its flaws. It is noticeable that the debate in the other place commenced at the instigation of Lord Scott of Foscote, who was a favourite judge of the Labour party at the time of the arms to Iraq affair. It seems to have changed its view of his analysis of legal issues. Lord Scott said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I find the European arrest warrant proposal much more worrying. Its purpose is to replace the current extradition procedures between member states with a much speedier summary procedure … we have to remember that everyone in this country, including those regarded as fugitives from justice in other states, are entitled to the protection of our laws while they are in this country and entitled to be protected by reference to the standards that we believe are appropriate. In principle, we should not send people to be tried abroad unless we can be satisfied that they will receive a fair trial and unless there is a proper case for them to answer in the foreign country that seeks to try them.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Our present extradition procedures have three important built-in safeguards. One is the so-called double criminality rule. We do not extradite people to face trial on charges that we do not recognise as offences. We would not extradite someone to face charges of homosexuality that would not be criminal in this country or to face blasphemy charges. Many examples can be found.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Secondly, there is requirement that before a person is to be extradited, it must be shown that there is a proper case for him to answer. That is colloquially called the sufficiency test—there must be a sufficient case. We would not extradite if, by our standards, there was no proper case to be answered.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Thirdly, extradition under current procedures is, in the last resort, subject to a political decision to be taken by the responsible Minister—the Home Secretary—as to whether the individual should be sent to the country that has requested him for trial. That, too, constitutes a safeguard. I do not believe that the Minister would give his consent to the extradition of someone to a country which did not guarantee by our standards that this person would receive a fair trial."—[
	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 19 November 2001; Vol. 628, c. 949.]</p></blockquote>
The three safeguards summarised by Lord Scott encapsulate our concerns. Many other legal commentators and Lords also echoed those concerns, as did the distinguished legal editor of 
	<i>The Daily Telegraph,</i> Joshua Rozenberg, formerly of the BBC. In the light of the current publicity about the British plane-spotters who are under detention in Greece, it is outrageous for Her Majesty's Government to be signing up to the proposal. They should be the first to veto it; they should not wait for the Italian Government to veto it and then try to find a way round the veto. A British Government should be concerned first and foremost and always with the risk to innocent British citizens. Instead, the Government are prepared to sacrifice them so that the process will be faster and more efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is precisely what is wrong with the Government's attitude. They do not believe in safeguards or the importance of the traditions of English law, built up over centuries by our forebears. They are concerned with modernisation, speed and efficiency. I remind the Minister that it is far better that the extradition procedures are delayed for 100 people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
who may be considered guilty in other countries than that one entirely innocent British citizen should be wrongly sent abroad at the instigation of a corrupt judicial authority abroad. Unfortunately, there are corrupt and politically motivated judicial authorities in our EU partner countries. We have given some examples of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree with the long-standing principle that a British subject who is accused of a crime while visiting another country can lawfully be tried there? Is he drawing a distinction between what happens if the British subject is still in the other country and what happens if he has crossed the border and is back in Britain? Is the hon. Gentleman saying that in one case it is perfectly all right for him to be tried but in the other we should be prepared to impose a delay of, perhaps, years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not saying that. Surely, the hon. Gentleman understands that we as Members of Parliament have a duty to protect our constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it has never happened to any of his constituents, but constituents of mine faced improperly motivated judicial proceedings in another country. I took up the case of a professional footballer several years ago who played for a team in my constituency. It was thought that he had been arrested by police officers in another EU country—one of those countries that would be operating the EU arrest warrant if it is agreed to—simply because of the colour of his skin. He was kept in detention for a considerable period of time. Again, it was thought that the judicial authorities shared the colour prejudice of the police officers who arrested him. He was entirely innocent, and we managed to get all the charges dropped with the help of the then Foreign and Home Secretaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our duty to ensure that entirely innocent British citizens are protected, whether they are abroad or at home. The debate in another place made it clear that trumped-up charges with a possible penalty of 12 months' imprisonment or more could be proceeded with, a warrant could be issued and a British police officer could turn up on the doorstep of one of our constituents and take them into custody. They could be shipped off to face detention abroad, perhaps for months or years, on the basis of completely inappropriate charges. Parliament should not allow that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several Lords in another place expressed serious concerns about the way in which investigations are carried out in other countries. Lord Scott of Foscote said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the investigative process in a number of European countries is carried out under the aegis of a judicial officer, the investigating magistrate, the 
	<i>juge d'instruction.</i> That is not a procedure we have in this country. It is not at all clear at what stage in his investigation the investigating magistrate will be able to issue an arrest warrant to bring before him from this country or any other member state an individual where he is not yet satisfied there should be a trial but requires more information from the individual in question."</p></blockquote>
The position is worrying indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
Similar points were made by my noble Friend Lord Mayhew of Twysden, by the distinguished lawyer Lord Lester of Herne Hill, on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, who made some additional points about his concern that the ECHR is not a sufficient safeguard when faced with the EU arrest warrant, and particularly by my noble Friend Lord Lamont of Lerwick. Lord Lamont said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The seriousness of the situation potentially was illustrated in a remark in a recent newspaper article written by the director of Liberty"—</p></blockquote>
John Wadham, who said—
	<br><blockquote><p>"'What…[this warrant] could mean in practice is that a British Police Officer will arrive at your door with, for instance, an Italian Police Officer in tow to arrest you. They will take you via an impotent British Court to Italy where you will be dumped in a prison to await trial, perhaps for something somebody thinks you did when on holiday."'</p></blockquote>
Lord Lamont continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That is possibly a slight exaggeration, although I have a close friend who, on an Italian beach, spotted a young boy trying to pinch his wallet. He gave hot pursuit to the child and found himself arrested by an Italian policeman for threatening a child. It took several years and a lot of money before he managed to get himself out of that situation. Of course, it will be pointed out that such situations may arise under any legal system, and I accept that. However, that makes one pause before removing the requirement of 
	<i>prima facie</i> evidence or consideration of the likelihood of a fair trial before extradition."</p></blockquote>
Those concerns are not trivial. They were expressed by one of our most important independent human rights organisations, Liberty, which many Labour Members support. Lord Lamont went on to quote another Labour lawyer, Mr. John Mortimer QC,
	<br><blockquote><p>"a pillar of the Labour establishment—who, commenting on attempts to harmonise legal provision in Europe, wrote an article in the 
	<i>Daily Mail</i> last year. He said:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'There is a real danger that our precious rights and liberties may be lost in a vague and haphazard attempt to impose a single system of law on Europe … Would you care to be arrested on the say-so of a Greek or Spanish judge and be packed off, with no case having been made against you, to face a trial under a foreign system in another country?'</p></blockquote>
He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>'You can be kept for a long time in a Spanish or Italian prison in the hope that suspense may force a confession, or that some sort of evidence might turn up.'"—[
	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 19 November 2001; Vol. 828, c. 952–63.]</p></blockquote>
That is what is happening now, and that is why we think that it would be inappropriate to remove all the safeguards, particularly with the vague list of offences in article 2(2), such as swindling or xenophobia. They are far too vague to be specific offences under English law. As was pointed out in our previous, aborted sitting, that is simply not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other Lords spoke in the debate and expressed their concerns, including Baroness Park of Monmouth, Baroness Stern, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, who has already been referred to, Lord Goodhart for the Liberal Democrats and Lord Kingsland, the shadow Lord Chancellor. None of their concerns was addressed satisfactorily by Lord Rooker when he concluded the debate for the Government, nor have those concerns been addressed by the Minister today. The Minister is elevating his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
desire to push ahead into a virtue. He is committing the Government to try to find a way round the Italian veto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members believe that the Government should have ruled out the European arrest warrant. It is absolutely unacceptable and we shall continue to fight tooth and nail against it. It has nothing to do with necessary anti-terrorism provisions; its consequences are entirely unacceptable. We hope that even at this 11th hour, the Government will listen to some of their own Back Benchers, to what we have said and what so many Lords in another place have said, see sense and realise that if they sign up to the proposal they will sacrifice one of the most important safeguards of our judicial system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall address the general scrutiny issues that arose in various points of order. This sort of question will be arise frequently as we attempt to scrutinise on-going debates. We must accept that if we want the House to have influence on discussions, we are not only able but required to comment on works in progress. That will always be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the substance of the debate, for as long as legal systems have existed, the law of foreign countries has been accepted as the valid law when we visit those countries. The classic phrase, "When in Rome do as the Romans do," springs to mind. I am surprised to hear the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) appear to undermine that principle and say that he is so suspicious of the authorities in some European Union countries that it is the duty of the Government to extricate their citizens, even when they are believed to have committed an offence in those countries. Would he accept that in reverse? Would he accept the Greek Government's interfering in the British legal process if we attempted to prosecute under our law someone who was on holiday or otherwise visiting Britain? On that principle it would be impossible to prosecute international crime at all, and we would rapidly descend into chaos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept in practice, despite the hon. Gentleman's reservations, that legal authorities are entitled to prosecute people who visit their country, we then need to consider special cases, such as when an alleged offence comes to light only after the suspect has left the country. We are familiar with instances of child abduction in custody cases, when one of the parents seizes the child and leaves for another country before a British court has decided which of them should have custody. We know that considerable heartbreak arises when years of litigation follow before the issue can be resolved, at which point the person who kidnapped the child may even be rewarded. The court may decide that after the passage of several years, despite the gravity of the offence, it is not in the child's interests that justice be done by restoring him or her to the other parent. I do not believe that the hon. Members who put the case for a lengthy judicial process have taken such cases into consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
It is important that the amendment to paragraph 2(3) that the Minister referred to is maintained. As the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon said last week, the current version would be flawed if a British court could require the production of a German suspect without that suspect having ever set foot in Britain or had anything to do with this country. If a relatively minor offence was involved that carried a one or two-year sentence, that would lead to serious difficulties, especially when the European Union expands to 25 countries. We could not guarantee that abuses might not occur in such cases. Will the Minister reassure the Committee that the British Government will press to maintain the latest version, as it ensures that when no dramatic offence has occurred that requires extraterritoriality, and the sentence may be less than three years, the issuing country cannot insist on its tradition if the crime was not committed on its territory?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one question of detail. Article 2(1) refers to the 12 months, which we have established should be a minimum rather than a maximum sentence. The Minister tells us that we now require a three-year limit to waive the requirement for dual criminality under article 2(3). Under article 2(1), when a sentence has been passed, the minimum period is not 12 months but four months. Does the latest version of the text of the agreement towards which we are working mention three years under article 2(3) in such cases, when sentence has already been passed, or does it refer to one year? Is the period triple that in article 2(1), or is it three years in both cases whether for charge or sentence?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to go back to the question that I raised about the internet—although I am aware that some Members feel it to be a somewhat nerdish point, we will find that it becomes increasingly important in such international legal debates. Let us take the case of holocaust denial, which, for historical reasons that we all understand, is a serious offence in Germany. I believe that it can carry a custodial sentence of at least three years, and although I may be wrong, let us assume that to be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three distinct types of case. I mentioned one during questions to the Minister, in which a British subject goes to Germany and asserts that in his view, the Jews were well treated under the Nazis and the holocaust is an invention. We are aware of at least one case in which a prominent British historian made assertions that could have assisted those who wanted to deny the extent of the holocaust. In the second type of case, the assertion would be made only in Britain, and in the third type it would be made on the internet with the clear intention of reaching people in Germany, because it would be written in German and the website advertised in Germany. In that case, the Germans would have a reasonable case for asserting the extraterritoriality exemption and saying that the person was, in effect, committing a crime in Germany.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the fact that some hon. Members find the subject difficult, but we could put the example in reverse. Imagine that someone has set up a website abroad to stir up hatred in, for instance, the Muslim

community in Britain, and that it is specifically aimed at Britain and urges civil unrest. We would then be entitled to claim extraterritoriality, even if that person had never set foot in Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett) and I come from different legal systems, so we are conscious of the fact that we must accept that people move readily and rapidly between one legal system and another. There are three systems within the United Kingdom, and many more within the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As colleagues will expect me to say, we as a party do not traditionally have a problem with European co-operation, and that includes the criminal justice system. My judgment is like that of my colleagues who have been involved with the subject in the European Parliament, including Graham Watson, a Member of the European Parliament who chairs the relevant Committee. They were among those who recommended to the Parliament that we move towards a common European arrest warrant to deal with terrorist-related crime. That was the genesis of the recommendation that I read out earlier in a question to the Minister; I will not repeat it now. It was one of a set of recommendations to the Council made by the European Parliament in September, and sought to establish a European search and arrest warrant to deal with terrorism. If the Minister had come to the Committee with that as the proposal to be put by the Government to the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Europe and then to the Heads of Government meeting, there would be much less disagreement in the Committee—I do not speak with any authority of the views of Labour or Conservative Members, but conversations that I have had elsewhere suggest that that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our position is that the process has been taken in the wrong order. I understand that there must be many attempts to get a draft right, and I accept that there have been three previous scrutiny exercises concerning drafts that have come before Parliament. That is a good thing. However, it is clear that on the previous occasion agreement had not been reached between the Committees concerned and the Government. The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich, said that there had been no acceptance that the matter had become so uncontroversial that it ought not to have wider parliamentary debate. Indeed, the recommendation was that it should be considered on the Floor of the House, which would signify its importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument was that we should have had the extradition consultation first. The Government, to their credit, carried that out. However, we should then have considered the extradition legislation. Then, in the light of the debates in both Houses of Parliament, and the Scottish Parliament, we could have known what Parliament wanted the Government to agree with other EU member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
I wish that we had gone down that road. I accept that there may have been a case for an exception to the usual process because of the events of 11 September, but that should have been limited to certain ring-fenced matters, and should have been time-limited. There are discussions going on elsewhere relating to debates in the House of Lords on the European third-pillar issues this evening. We could reasonably have accepted a fast-track process for European third-pillar matters for three or six months while Parliament considered the matter, after which time the power would lapse. That in itself would have been controversial, but not nearly as controversial as the proposal before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Library supplied an answer to an inquiry in September—I have not repeated the request since—about how many people had been affected by the extradition system. Of a total of 49 people in the UK in custody awaiting extradition on 10 September, 19 were awaiting extradition to EU member states, of whom six were awaiting extradition to Italy, four to France, three to Germany, two to the Netherlands, two to Belgium, one to Spain and one to Greece. That is significant, because there were considerable numbers of people in this country with processes under way against them, and there will be similar numbers in other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, I know from constituency experience how controversial the issue can become. It does not come up often in my constituency surgery or postbag, but when it does, it is difficult to secure justice through the system. My most recent experience involved a Sierra Leonean constituent of mine who was arrested in Belgium for an alleged immigration offence, when she had actually been on a visit to support a friend at a family event. There were real difficulties in securing justice for her. She was a UK permanent resident but not an EU citizen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears from my unprofessional, but I hope adequate, understanding of the compromise proposal on the table following the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers last week, that it includes the introduction of a retrospectivity clause, which is always controversial, however much one understands the reasons for it. Because the motion goes wider than the European Parliament proposal, and because of that compromise proposal, my hon. Friends and I cannot give our support to the motion. We are not against the principle behind it, and I know that the Minister will understand our position. We are glad that the Government are working towards a satisfactory conclusion, but we would be very unhappy if, at the Heads of Government meeting at the end of this week, they reached a conclusion that went broader than the terrorism proposals made in September.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because this is only a take-note opportunity, our recommendation and our wish is that the Government should continue to seek agreement on the more limited terrorist-related matters this weekend and that, irrespective of whether the Italian Government keep to their position, the other matters should be left until the we have dealt with the legislation that Ministers intend

	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister and other hon. Members will recall that I expressed some unease last week about the procedure being adopted for making what seemed a radical change in British and European law. My sense of unease has not gone; indeed, it is stronger. A Sub-Committee of the European Scrutiny Committee, which deals with European legislation, seems to be making a decision in principle about a major matter of law. The Bill will come later, should the matter be agreed today, but that seems an inappropriate body to make such a decision. Scrutinising legislation does not mean deciding a major point of law in principle, but my fear is that that is what is happening. I may be wrong, and I hope that the Minister will reassure me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reassure the Minister that I am not against the idea of making extradition proceedings smoother and more efficient. I do not want countries to be able to protect people who are alleged to have committed criminal offences, or to prevent a proper trial in the appropriate country. I am in favour of that, but I am worried that such a draconian change to British and European law is necessary to achieve it. That, at least, should be debated on the Floor of the House and not by Committees. I too have a copy of the debate in another place, and I browsed through some of their lordships comments. I am not a lawyer and I am not comfortable speaking on matters of law, but I want to the matter to be debated more fully than we can debate it here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned my worries about dual criminality. Rather than allowing a general abolition of dual criminality, with some exceptions, it would be better to eliminate it from specific areas in so as to be able to prosecute some offences, such as terrorism, properly. Another area is specialty: someone who is extradited from one country to another on a charge of, for instance, theft, can be accused on arrival of causing grievous bodily harm, or whatever, instead. That is slightly worrying, especially if the charge is entirely unrelated. The document does not seem to specify that it has to be a related crime. Raising a crime from manslaughter to murder is within reason, but to change a small holding charge to something different would be worrying, especially in certain countries within the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that point, some countries in the EU, which I shall not name—[HON. MEMBERS: "GO on."] No, I will not. I have good friends there, and they would not be pleased about my casting aspersions on their system of law, their law officers and their police forces. A senior police officer has told me that for the past two or three years, when he passes information through Europol it will be secure in some countries but not others. In fact, I was told that in one particular place, the first thing that the police do is hand the information to the criminals concerned. That is worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
Reference has been made to the possibility of legal structures in some parts of the EU being influenced by a fraternity of people with criminal tendencies, and there is a tradition of that in some parts of Europe. One can imagine someone from such a country doing something in Britain to upset that fraternity, which could then get a court to extradite him on a trivial charge, get him back where it wanted him and then exercise a degree of control—I shall go into no more detail than that. That is worrying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend refers to a trivial charge, but is he aware of the one and three-year limits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go into detail. We should not exaggerate too much, but a local criminal fraternity with a clever lawyer and the police force in its pocket could indulge in practices about which we were unhappy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is often said that difficult cases make bad law. However, draconian changes to the law should be tested through theoretical examples. The theoretical case that I am suggesting may not even be that difficult, but such possibilities must be raised in a proper debate and taken into account when any change is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way forward might be for the senior police officer to say, "Let's have the arrangement only with countries whose judiciaries and police forces we can trust." However, we will not be able to trust the legal systems in all countries. We will be happy when the police force and judiciary in every country are as splendid as ours—although mistakes have occasionally been made even in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other possibilities worry me. Governments must occasionally stand for re-election, and rather unpleasant political parties have put themselves forward in some EU countries. In many ways, Austria is a splendid country, but an unpleasant party shared power there at one time. One can see laws being introduced that might appeal to those with right-wing Conservative views, but not to me or to many of my constituents. Such parties could introduce authoritarian laws concerning matters that we do not think are important, but they do. We might then have to extradite people to countries of which we did not approve. We are careful about where we extradite people to: we do not extradite them to countries that do not have democratic Governments, or which have brutal treatments for offences such as adultery. We make sure that we do not let people go back to countries where they might suffer a terrible fate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even within the EU, however, there are concerns. I have concerns and I want to be reassured. It is not appropriate for the Committee to make such a decision. I shall vote for the motion, but only because it uses the words "take note". I take note of the document with interest, but I shall want a lot of reassurance from the Minister and the Government before I am happy for us to support such a dramatic change in the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I studied history a long time ago, I often wondered how Members of Parliament must have felt before the civil war in the 17th century. How must our counterparts have felt in Germany in the early 1930s, in eastern Europe in the brief interlude before the Communists took power after the second world war, or in the colonies during the American revolution? Things are happening in Parliament in these days that our constituents would find profoundly offensive if they had the time and will to think about them deeply enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals in the draft framework decision are a blow to the fundamental liberties that we have enjoyed under British law for centuries. The maintenance of our liberties and freedom is a tradition that has suffused, inspired and guided all our previous work. But now, the deliberate obliteration of all that by European Union diktat seems to have the acquiescence of Her Majesty's Government—or perhaps even more than that, because the motion includes the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"supports the Government's active participation".</p></blockquote>
The Committee should be discussing the exact proposed framework directive, but we are not, because it is an evolving procedure and we are merely being asked to support Her Majesty's Government's participation in the debate. As the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) said, we are invited only to take note. There is nothing unusual about that. In all our deliberations in European Standing Committee B, we are only ever invited to take note. If we were not to take note, Her Majesty's Government would move the motion on the Floor of the House and it would be nodded through without further debate. That is utterly preposterous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final line of the motion refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the basis of the principles of mutual recognition."</p></blockquote>
That goes to the heart of the issue. The abolition of the principle of dual criminality makes the proposals utterly obnoxious. Why should our citizens, who have enjoyed liberties second to none, be held culpable by other legal jurisdictions that are, in many cases, inferior to ours?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman be a little more precise? Which countries' jurisdictions does he believe are inferior to our own?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that the plane-spotters in Greece are thinking just that at this very moment. I do not need to say more. Many of us have received letters from constituents who have fallen foul of local laws in European Union countries, and have not emerged happier for the experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>David Cairns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument that British citizens should be exempt from the consequences of any act that may be deemed illegal by the foreign territory where it is committed, or that they should be tried only once they have returned to this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not. If a British citizen is arrested in a European Union country for committing an act that is an offence in that country, he or she must stand trial for it in that country. But if the British citizen returns to the UK, and the alleged offence is not considered to be a criminal act in the UK, then extradition should not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Government justify the whole procedure to which the motion relates on the basis of the reaction to the terrorist atrocities in the United States on 11 September—but most of the draft proposals deal with other things. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells so eloquently said, article 22 is a catch-all provision, because it is all too likely that a rogue judge could be induced to issue an arrest warrant for British citizens in southern Italy, for example, and that if a prosecution were not secured, the charge could be changed. The charge might start out as fraud, but if that did not work, it could be changed to corruption or swindling. What about so-called football hooligans who get overexcited and are accused of racism and xenophobia? Xenophobia is a passive condition. Incitement to racial hatred is an offence, of course, but not liking strangers very much is not an offence under British law, and we should not be subject to these obnoxious provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having accepted—unlike his colleague the hon. Member for Surrey Heath—that European courts have jurisdiction in their own countries, is the hon. Gentleman now saying that this is a question not of liberty but of geography, and that what matters is where the suspect happens to be at the time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never said that foreign countries did not have jurisdiction in their own territory. They do, under their own laws. A British citizen who goes abroad and allegedly commits an offence abroad should be tried abroad. I am saying that if the alleged offence is not an offence under British law, the accused should not find himself subject to extradition proceedings when he returns to the UK. There is nothing complicated about that. The question of safeguards is fundamental. To me, 30 days seems an inordinately short time for the execution of a warrant and extradition proceedings. There are good reasons why the due processes could take much longer—a multitude of evidence might be required, or witnesses might need to be brought to substantiate a defendant's claims. The time limit is high-handed and unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, in cases in which multiple jurisdictions are seeking to extradite an individual and there is a contradiction or a dispute about which jurisdiction the individual should be extradited to, Eurojust seems to have the last word. Eurojust seems to me to be a contradiction in terms. I shall be glad if the Minister can let me know what it is and what it does. Do our citizens know that? I doubt it very much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document should have been debated in a proper fashion on the Floor of the House. I shall not vote to take note of it—but I doubt whether the Government will take note of my not taking note.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>David Cairns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the motion and the action being taken in moving towards the common European arrest warrant. I also understand the frustration of the Minister, who must deal with the current situation. We have not discussed that; we are here to scrutinise proposed changes to it. He is right to draw our attention to the anomalies and difficulties in the present situation and the frustrations and evasions of justice that it allows. I am concerned about the terms in which much of the argument has been couched. We have cast rather a lot of stones from our glass house today, and the notion that, almost uniquely— although we may just allow a few other countries into our club—we have a perfect system of law completely above and beyond any influence other than the purest interpretation of due process, is nauseating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could my hon. Friend not even vaguely entertain the idea that objections to removing safeguards for British citizens grow not out of the artificial objections that he has just given, but from the basic desire to protect British citizens?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>David Cairns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could admit that. If the hon. Lady—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am your friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>David Cairns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend—I am sorry I did not call her that—makes that case I shall certainly listen closely. She has not yet spoken, and I am responding to other speeches that I have heard, which have not made that case, but have argued that we have a better system of law than everybody else, so we should not be extraditing anyone to anywhere. That is what I have heard. If I am wrong, I am sure that my hon. Friend will correct that when she speaks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other countries might look at our record of gross miscarriages of justice in recent years and have very strong doubts about extraditing anyone to this country. Examples such as the Birmingham six, the Guildford four and many others might be debated, perhaps with more validity, in other countries whose Parliaments are currently subjecting the issue to scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our system, or rather systems, of justice—as the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey pointed out, we have more than one criminal justice system—are at least on a par with those of Europe. I make no claim that we operate on an elevated level and cannot trust foreigners to dispense justice. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath asked a question using the example of a corrupt Sicilian magistrate under the control of the mafia. I appreciate that that was an example, but it was particularly ill chosen. Is he aware that it was because of the courage of those very magistrates that the back of the mafia was broken in Sicily? Those brave magistrates paid for their commitment to justice and the rule of law with their lives. That they should be disparaged in this Committee is disgraceful, and I hope that other hon. Members will not join in disparaging them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to set the record straight. I was simply citing an example to show that if, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will concede has happened in the past, a magistrate were under the control of the mafia, any request for extradition issued by such a corrupt magistrate would be open to the gravest suspicion. I share in his tribute to those who bravely stood out against the mafia. Any politician in this country would. Nevertheless, one can envisage—because it is documented as having happened, and not only in Sicily—that organised crime could take control of parts of a judicial system. That is the danger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>David Cairns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman has clarified his remarks by paying tribute to the magistrates in question, but I still think that considering all the areas of Europe that he could have chosen, he picked a poor example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been mentioned that we are being invited to make concessions, whether those are good, as I believe they are, or bad, as other hon. Members will contend. None the less, we have not adequately acknowledged the fact that our European Union partners are being asked to make concessions at least as great. The Minister mentioned that some countries, unlike the UK, do not let their nationals be extradited. The fact that they are now prepared to do that is an enormous step. We should pay tribute to that; those countries are our partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, after all, considering extraditing people so that they can stand trial. We are not conceding a warrant to allow British citizens to be taken abroad and thrown in dungeons, with the keys thrown away, without due process of law. If, as he said in response to my intervention, the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood accepts that other countries have a perfect right to bring people to trial in their territory for offences committed there, it seems to me that he should accept their right to apply for extradition of those who have evaded justice while in that territory, and our right to co-operate, if we accept the legality and robustness of their legal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case of the plane-spotters in Greece has been mentioned. From what I have read of the case I strongly believe, as I expect do all members of the Committee, that those concerned are innocent. As an aviation enthusiast, although not a plane-spotter, I am sure that they were engaged in a harmless and peaceful activity. None the less, we must look at the matter to some extent from the Greeks' point of view. If people turned up in our country, if there were no tradition of plane-spotting here, and began taking photographs of our military aircraft, noting their taking off and landing and their registrations and types, there would be at least a prima facie case to be investigated. I hope that when the case is investigated the people concerned will be released, as we all believe that they are innocent. However, I do not accept the idea that there is no prima facie case, and that people are simply being banged up on the say-so of some dodgy Greek.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

For the avoidance of doubt, I reiterate that I believe in the innocence of those people, but I think that there is a prima facie case for investigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Lest anyone think that I am going to be a cheerleader, I now come to my reservations. As I said to the Minister, I have reservations about the ambiguity of the terms according to which we will allow the executing country to decline to pursue the warrant, as outlined in article 2(4). There seem to be shifting sands. First it was said that the principle would not be applied, then that it might not be applied, then that it might not be applied in four or five cases, and now that it might not be applied under article 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have liberal laws on abortion, less so on euthanasia, and progressively more so on sexuality. I make no comment on whether they are good or bad. However, people feel very nervous when such measures are not accompanied with some kind of safeguard. That is the one aspect about which I have reservations. I look forward to discussing the matter in much greater detail on the Floor of the House when the primary legislation is debated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Hon. Members have talked about extraditing people for petty crime. The discussion got so stupid that the hon. Gentleman said that not liking a foreigner very much might be considered a crime. I am not aware of any EU country where not liking a foreigner very much is punishable by 12 months in prison. Moreover, as I have said, the period is not 30 days but 90 days. We are not under an EU diktat—this is a third-pillar proposal that requires unanimity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said that the genesis of the measure was in the European Parliament in September. He is not here now, so I say to his hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West that the Government's position is clear, and has been for a long time. Opposition Members have repeatedly claimed that the measure originates from 11 September. It does not—it originates from the temporary agreement in which it was decided to try to create an area of justice and safety across the EU. How on earth do we do that unless we have a framework of law that backs it up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Cameron</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hold on a minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) asked about the four-month period in relation to sentences. That remains. This is for cases in which someone has effectively escaped or absconded after sentencing. The European arrest warrant will apply only in cases where four months of a custodial sentence remain to be served. It will not apply in relation to any crime with a sentence of less than 12 months. Dual criminality will not be required to be abolished for crimes with sentences of less than three years—but for people who have absconded or escaped from prison, four months will be the minimum requirement. We cannot and will not extradite people for the purposes of investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position on abortion and euthanasia provisions is very clear. They are not a requirement in relation to the abolition of dual criminality in the framework document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I give way to my hon. Friend, she asked me for a definition of a judicial authority. Having listened to the comments of Opposition Members, I imagine that they must be advising their friends and relatives not to travel abroad. I would not want to go to any of the countries that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath describes, where he says that we are likely to be locked up on trumped up charges by corrupt and politically motivated judiciaries. Where are those countries? Does the hon. Gentleman go back to his constituency and advise his constituents not to travel abroad?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel guilty now, because during the short time in which I have had the privilege of holding my current position I have been responsible for signing extradition warrants to send people back to these dreadful places. I have sent people back to the examining magistrate in Liege, to the magistrate at the public prosecutor's office in Amsterdam, to the court
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
of Brescia, to the county tribunal of Bobigny, to Judge Weber of Saarbrucken, and to magistrate Judge Maria Teresa Palacios Criado of central trial court No. 3 in Madrid. That is in southern Europe; what on earth have I done? God knows what happened to the person concerned, or whether they are even still alive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cameron</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way during his knockabout finish. If, as he says, the genesis for the provision is something other than 11 September, will he guarantee—he failed to do so earlier—that it will be passed on the Floor of the House through primary legislation on extradition, rather than through accelerated procedures under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill? That guarantee is necessary because this is a very important issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had given the hon. Gentleman that guarantee. We intend to introduce primary legislation to modernise our extradition procedures in respect not only of the European Union but of other states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that my hon. Friend the Minister does not have a definition of the sort that I asked for. Will he say whether the European Court of Justice could overrule any decisions that we take on the first and second lists, should the House decide not to accept any part of the Bill because it conflicts with our normal tenets of democracy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give a definition because, as I thought I made clear to my hon. Friend, the judicial authority is that accepted by the issuing state currently applying for extradition. The people whose names I read out are the judicial authorities. We are already extraditing people, yet anyone would think that this was a new measure, and we did not already send people back to face justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We live in a modern age and people are travelling more and more. We see people from other countries on our streets every day, and we travel to their countries as well. Perhaps there are some hon. Members in the Committee who want to turn the clock back and bring such travel to an end, but I doubt whether our people do. However, with increased travel and freedom comes—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Why is the hon. Gentleman tapping his desk?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant the hon. Lady; I am sorry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have three choices in this modern age. First, we can stay where we are and continue to insist on an antiquated and burdensome extradition system that, in effect, allows those who commit crimes in our country, and British people who commit crimes in European partner countries, which are signed up to the ECHR, to escape justice. The question is not one of costs but of whether we want justice. The second
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
alternative is to invent and sign up to an all-embracing European justice system—sweeping away an existing system that we have got used to, and which we feel guarantees our rights—and expect other member states to do the same. The third and only remaining alternative is to go down the road of mutual recognition, with safeguards where absolutely necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a fourth way. By all means improve and build on the present system of extradition, but why does the Minister persistently put the convenience and expediency of the requirements of modern government ahead of centuries of judicial protection, which the Labour party used to be proud of and support? Justice is for the small and the weak, yet the Minister is demolishing the entire system simply to give the Governments of Europe a quicker way of achieving their own desires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put the interests of effective justice in a modern age ahead of the considerations to which the right hon. Gentleman refers. I do not feel that every foreigner is corrupt, politically motivated and intends to deal with—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
