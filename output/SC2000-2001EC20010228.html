	<section>

	<div class='title'>Informing and Consulting Employees</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Competitiveness (Mr. Alan Johnson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I will bring the Committee up to date on the consideration of the proposed directive in Brussels. The draft directive was first proposed by the Commission in November 1998, and my Department submitted an explanatory memorandum on it in January 1999, but it was not discussed substantively in the Council until the beginning of the French presidency in July 2000. Following a brief discussion at the Employment and Social Policy Council on 17 October, the presidency produced a revised version of the Commission's proposal. I submitted an explanatory memorandum on that text on 21 November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission accepted the presidency text as a basis for further work, but reserved its position on the deletion of the sanctions provision in article 7.3. At the Employment and Social Policy Council on 28 November, the presidency attempted to secure a qualified majority in support of the proposal, but could not. The text has undergone minor revision since then, but is essentially the same as that which formed the subject of the explanatory memorandum of 21 November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Council at Nice concluded that the Council should continue its examination of the draft directive. The Swedish presidency has said that it intends to work on the dossier with a view to reaching a political agreement on it, but no substantive progress was made at the working group meeting in January. The directive is not on the agenda of the Employment and Social Policy Council meeting of 6 March. The presidency has indicated that it will pursue the matter at the Councils in May or June.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give a brief overview of the directive's content. As currently drafted, it aims to establish a general framework of minimum requirements for employees' rights to information and consultation in undertakings within the European Community. An undertaking is a private or public undertaking that carries out an economic activity, whether or not it operates for gain. The directive applies to undertakings with 50 or more employees, but member states may choose to apply it to establishments with 20 or more employees. An establishment is a subdivision of an undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive requires the employer to inform and consult employees' representatives on the range of matters laid down in paragraph 1 of article 3. Paragraphs 3a and 3b of article 3 set out the modalities of that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
Article 4 provides for member states to allow management and labour to define freely, through negotiated agreement, the practical arrangements for informing and consulting employees. Such agreements may contain provisions different from those laid down in article 3, but must respect the principles of article 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5 provides that information may be withheld by the management in certain circumstances, or may be disclosed on the condition that the employees' representatives hold it in confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 8 states that the directive does not prejudice the European works councils directive, but that it is applicable to the information and consultation procedures set out in the directives on collective redundancies and transfers of undertakings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scrutiny Committee report raised various questions, which I will be pleased to answer. I will first provide some details on the Government's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that it is desirable to inform and consult employees. It produces a better informed, better motivated and more adaptable workforce, which can increase company competitiveness. However, the Government are not convinced that a constructive dialogue between management and employees is best achieved through statutory requirements and the sanctions and penalties that would flow from a directive. We want a dialogue based on trust and partnership, not legal obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Union could pursue policies designed to foster partnership. Article 137, the treaty base for the draft directive, provides that the Council may adopt measures that will encourage co-operation between member states through initiatives to improve knowledge and develop exchanges of information, and through best practices. That would be in keeping with the process agreed at Lisbon, and the partnership approach that we have been developing in the UK. It would contribute to the goal agreed at Lisbon: to make the EU the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not persuaded that further regulation on the issue at the EU level is necessary. The EU has already adopted the European works council directive. In that case, there was a good argument for Community level action because the aim was to bring about information and consultation on a transnational basis. For the same reason, we have recently accepted the directive on the European company, which contains provision for employee involvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the proposed directive has no transnational elements. It would achieve nothing that could not be done by member states acting alone. The absence of a directive does not conflict with the requirements of the treaty and does not otherwise significantly damage member states' interests. The existing systems in member states for informing employees do not conflict with the treaty's requirement. Action at Community level would not bring clear benefits compared with action by member states. Those are the guidelines for assessing whether a proposed action conforms to the principle of subsidiarity. They are contained in the protocol on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, which was incorporated in the treaty of Amsterdam. That protocol is intended to supplement article 5 of the treaty establishing the European Community, which provides that the Community shall act in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our view, the directive does not conform to the requirements of article 5. The Government are not persuaded of the need for a directive that is difficult to reconcile with subsidiarity and that would cut across existing practices in member states for no benefit. I will be pleased to respond to the Committee's questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 am for questions to the Minister. I remind the Committee that questions must be asked one at a time; there should be ample opportunity for all hon. Members to ask several questions. Attlee-type brevity will be appreciated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was delighted to hear the Minister's statement. The Opposition fully agree with the Government's approach. What must now be under scrutiny is how successful the Government will be at establishing British interests in the EU. How successful has he been so far, and how confident is he of being so in future, in securing a blocking minority against the directive? What is the latest news on German and Danish support for the Government's position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the Council meeting on 28 November, there was no qualified majority. Only one substantive discussion has taken place since—the working group meeting in January. The position of the countries that the hon. Gentleman mentioned was stated clearly at that meeting and has not changed. There was no qualified majority in November or January and we expect there to be none in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition may be satisfied with the Government's position, but I am not sure that Labour Members will be. The Minister says that information is best provided through a partnership built on trust. However, if no one sets down in statute the minimum requirements for information to be given to employees, what are the chances of building partnerships in companies where employers have little respect for their employees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would turn that question around. Part of our argument is that the directive breaches subsidiarity. There is a case for us to examine our domestic legislation. On 18 January, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced that we would look at the collective redundancies agreement. We were pleased to sign up to the European works councils agreement to which most of the recent high-profile cases should have been subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's view, and my strongly held personal view—I have had some experience of such issues—is that genuine partnership and co-operation cannot be engendered through a mechanistic, legal directive route. In fact, that approach would directly
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
militate against creating the climate that we want to establish. There is some history of that, for example Whitleyism, the Bullock report and the industrial democracy experiment that was conducted as recently as the late 1970s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As there would be legal provisions to be decided by the European Court of Justice, it is possible that the very companies mentioned by my hon. Friend would be asking, "What is the minimum that we can get away with to comply with whatever directive?" rather than, "How do we change the culture of our organisation from confrontation to genuine partnership?" The issue should be addressed in our domestic legislation. I have strong views on it, as do the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More importantly, the directive does not in any way enhance the domestic situation; in many countries it cuts across it, with no benefit in terms of employee relations, which is why we are not alone in objecting to the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Darvill 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How far do other member states share the UK's conviction that the proposal breaches the principle of subsidiary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Each of the other member states, without exception, wants to preserve its own system of employment relations. The debate occurs in member states that have different systems, such as a voluntary approach. There is not the same degree of controversy in member states where the proposals coincide with what is already in force. In some member states the social partners make decisions on all such issues without any recourse to legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of subsidiarity arises insofar as every country is determined to preserve its own arrangements. We recognise that there must be a degree of flexibility with regard to subsidiarity; the protocol that supplements article 6 of the treaty contains guidelines, rather than firm rules. If this is not a case for subsidiarity, what is? There are several measures to which it is said that subsidiarity would not apply because it is flexible. All directives are flexible. On the basis of those arguments, it is difficult to see where subsidiarity would apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other member states are determined to protect their systems; our position is built around subsidiarity. I cannot argue for the other member states. However, as there is not a qualified majority for this, I assume that the other countries that are part of what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) described as a blocking minority feel the same way to varying degrees—whether they are considering subsidiarity or the extent to which the directive cuts across local arrangements, which is effectively the same argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Vincent Cable 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall that we went over much of this ground in a well attended debate in Westminster Hall a couple of weeks ago. While I accept that the principle of subsidiarity is valid and important, how would the Minister apply it to industries—of which the motor industry is the most obvious example—that are organised and managed on a European basis, and in which the existing European directives do not appear to have been effective in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
making companies apply elementary principles of consultation to their work forces? What happens to subsidiarity in that case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. The European works councils directive, to which we happily signed up, contains a clause that clearly states that, in circumstances such as those that have occurred, for example, at General Motors in Luton, at Ford, or at BMW-Rover, there should be consultation and an exchange of information about proposals with the work force through a European works council. There is a cross-European dimension to that. There is a strong argument for putting arrangements in place where workers in each member state cannot influence decisions or access information or consultation because decisions that affect them are made not in their own country, but elsewhere in Europe. A key question was posed by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in his announcement on 18 January: were European works councils used in these situations, and if not, why not? Existing voluntary agreements cannot be superseded by European works councils, and that is a proper area for investigation. The Government have consistently argued that even if the information and consultation directive had been in place in this country at the time when BMW's decision was taken in Munich, it would have been proper to use the EWC directive rather than this one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ivan Henderson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain what more the directive offers compared with the European works councils directive? Before I was elected to Parliament, I was involved in negotiating a European works council for a trade union, and I saw some of its useful points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister suggested that what really matters is the attitude of employers, rather than legislation, consultation or information. Historically, there has been a lack of negotiation and consultation between companies and their employees in this country. The previous Government encouraged that, and it has got to change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. There are many and varied reasons for that history. The United Kingdom is in a different situation from that of the rest of Europe because of the tradition of its industrial relations: both the trade union movement and employers have tended not to want interference from the state and have not wanted to adopt the models of industrial relations prevalent in continental Europe. Although it is important to acknowledge that background, the latest workplace employee relations survey—which is the most comprehensive of its kind and is being copied in Australia and Canada because it produces such good information—reveals that many companies of all sizes have procedures for consultation and information. The partnership fund has operated over the past four years. It was only a toe in the water—a mere £5 million was dedicated to it, but it has been a great success—to find out whether both sides of industry would respond in the way that the Government want. The baking industry, which covers
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
a broad range of businesses, has had a bad employment relations record, but many companies associated with baking have applied for partnership fund awards—as has London Underground, which also, dare I say, has suffered from bad industrial relations—and they have discovered that both sides of industry genuinely desire to improve their relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that there is a problem in this country on both sides of industry, and that it will be difficult to change the confrontational culture of the past, but that can be achieved by voluntary means. The introduction of the prescriptive methods and minimum standards that are set out in the information and consultation directive would militate against that, not least because the successful implementation of policies such as the minimum wage and the agenda contained in "Fairness at Work" requires both sides of industry to co-operate. The TUC and the Confederation of British Industry have very different views about the matter, and that suggests that, deep down, we would face considerable problems in trying to implement this kind of directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Anne McIntosh 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for missing the opening statement. Will the Minister explain why, given the explanatory memorandum statement, there has not yet been formal consultation on the document?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Committee agrees, I will think about that question and reply later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Publicly quoted companies have to give their shareholders information about profit warnings and threats to the future of the company. Does the Minister see any parallels between the minimum standards for that information and what the directive requires employers to give employees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. My hon. Friend is right. The Companies Act 1985 sets out disclosure requirements in company law. However, that is a world away from the minimum standards that would have to be enforced to give employees a new legal right to information and consultation in certain circumstances and to require member states to guarantee the exercise of those rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister knows, the Opposition want to support the Government in securing the defeat of the directive in Europe. Therefore, will he comment on the report in 
	<i>The Times</i> on 16 February, which said that Germany had agreed to support the British Government's position until the general election, but afterwards would swing its support behind the directive? Will he confirm that that report is false and that nobody in the Department of Trade and Industry—neither Minister nor civil servant—has made or discussed that suggestion with any German Minister or civil servant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speculation in 
	<i>The Times</i> and other newspapers is simply that—speculation. We have set out clearly, and do so again today, our position on the directive. On discussions between civil servants and Ministers, the position expressed by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Germans at a working group in January was exactly the same as that expressed in November at the Council of Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Hesford 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wirral, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned the TUC's position on the directive. Can he expand on that? What representations has the TUC made to the Government, and does it support the Government's stance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The representation from the TUC is that it supports the information and consultation directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister has had time to think about my first question. I want also to ask about the costs of implementing the proposed directive. Those costs are substantial, as is shown in the explanatory memorandum on pages 10 and 11. As well as the recurring cost, there will be a substantial set-up cost too. Has the Minister had the opportunity to ask his counterparts in Europe why the costs are so high?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have reflected on the hon. Lady's first point. We have had no formal consultation on the directive because, when the "Fairness at Work" White Paper was published, we also set out our views on the issue of information and consultation, which had already emerged from Europe. Our views were well known before the directive was published and, as such, it would have been wrong to conduct a sham consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady mentioned costs. We have not discussed them because we believe that the directive breaches subsidiarity. It would be wrong for us to give the Council of Ministers the impression that our opposition to the directive is a matter of cost or that we could overcome our difficulties through negotiation, because we are fundamentally opposed in principle to the directive. Costs will be a factor in some people's minds, but not in ours. It is not a cost issue; it is about subsidiarity and whether the directive would improve employment relations in Britain. We do not think that it would.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the same point, I have studied the regulatory impact assessment and I was surprised by the level of costs. Does the Minister agree that the likely cost of the directive will be much less for companies that have good practice in employment relations than for those that have poor practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend completely. Unions are free to negotiate with employers for such provisions on information and consultation, as part of their regular bargaining arrangements. Many companies have such provisions and they would incur a lesser cost following the introduction of the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the Opposition's wish to find out how successful the Government will be at resisting the directive, can my hon. Friend tell us when qualified majority voting was extended to this policy area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify a matter for the Committee rather than myself, as I tend to agree with the Government's position on the directive?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee wrote a round robin letter to the Minister's predecessor, which was copied to other members of the Committee. He wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we are disappointed that you have not commented on our suggestion that some legislation of this kind may be needed at Community level to balance the consequences of competitive pressures."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister respond to that now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a spurious argument and we do not agree that such legislation would balance competitive pressures. Furthermore, we do not believe that anything that could be done at European level could not be done at a member state level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For obvious reasons, countries with a long history of using such a model are sanguine about the directive. However, countries that do not have such a model, such as the UK, could have their competitiveness damaged by the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Lisbon process should be not just words, but something tangible. Under that process, we look at improvements in terms of best practice, bench marking and peer pressure, rather than through the regulatory sausage machine. Such measures, as I mentioned in my opening statement, would be far more effective in that area and in protecting competitiveness than a directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question is about the culture in this country. If we take a timid approach to the matter, there may be initial short-term benefits in some areas. However, in the longer term, our nation would lose out on the benefits of greater employee consultation. Should we impose a minimum standard of consultation that is higher than the current minimum standard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was almost in full agreement with my hon. Friend until his last comment. I wish to make it absolutely plain that we support information and consultation. We oppose the means rather than the end in this matter. We believe that there is a positive case to support the exchange of information and consultation, and for workers to be genuinely consulted at a time when the consultation means something, such as when they are in a position to suggest alternative proposals. That would benefit both business and competitiveness. Mechanisms, structures and minimum standards will not produce such a climate. As we have found before, they produce mechanisms and structures. The Government support information and consultation, but oppose the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw the Minister's attention to the working note of the Council of Europe from the general secretariat of the Council to the social questions working party, and particularly article 5?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely support the Government's position of resisting the imposition of the directive on our country. However, should the Minister not be able to do that, it would be incumbent on the Government to provide for the protection of confidentiality, particularly damaging confidential information that could be released by employees to third parties. Has the Minister considered the sanctions and penalties that could be imposed if there was a breach of such a confidentiality undertaking by employees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said in my opening statement—I do not think that the hon. Lady was present—the sanctions part of the directive is of concern even to those countries that generally support the directive. We are not party to the discussions on detail, because we oppose the directive in principle, but many countries have concerns about that aspect. It was flagged up at a meeting last year—I believe that it was in November—and is the most sensitive part of the directive for many of the countries that support the general framework of information and consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are there any aspects of the proposal that the Government do not oppose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the principle of information and consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are member states concerned that employees might inadvertently or even wilfully pass confidential material to a third party, in the spirit of openness under the proposed directive? Or are member states worried about the sanctions if such confidentiality is breached? Surely, there must be some provision to ensure that confidential information remains confidential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, but the sanctions are about breaches by workers, not companies. Concern was expressed about that in the European Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not discussed details. Our involvement in such discussions would have sent a false message to the rest of the European Union. Like other countries, we think that it is an issue of principle. We have not discussed the detailed points, including the sanctions, in the same detail as some of the other member states of Europe have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister think that we should have a contingency plan in case he loses the support of Germany and Denmark? Should he not have scrutinised the proposals in more detail and done his best to secure the best outcome for Britain? Would not that be a better approach?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not agree. That is a dangerous game to play when negotiating, and I have been involved in many negotiations in my time. We are in a happy position where the Opposition completely agree with the Government. I am sure that that will be the case with many other issues as we approach the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
general election. The hon. Gentleman and his colleagues would be the first to criticise us if a report from Brussels said that civil servants or Ministers were negotiating at such a detailed level. The confidentiality provisions suggested are similar to those in article 5 of the European works councils directive, so there is a sanctions precedent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ivan Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the event that the Government do not adopt the directive, how could we ensure that companies in this country consulted their employees on the major issues that affect their work, conditions and future employment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two ways. First, the partnership fund, which is encouraging a change in culture, should not be minimised in any way. That programme is an extraordinary success, and we can take it forward into a second term, subject to the electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, regulations already cover redundancies and health and safety. My hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) referred to the Companies Act 1985. An existing tranche of legislation insists on consultation in various circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we have a combination of culture change and the review announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on 18 January. We intend to analyse the argument that it is easier to dismiss workers in the UK than anywhere else in Europe. I am not sure that that is true. We also intend to look at whether the European works councils directive, which is relevant to many of the high-profile cases that we have had, is operating properly. Those strands will enable us to take the matter forward domestically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that we have not yet come to the negotiation of detail and I have a more general question. We have a Swedish presidency and the European Scrutiny Committee recently spent two full days meeting Ministers who are responsible for social policy, among other matters. The Swedish presidency has an ambitious programme and will be followed by the Belgian presidency which, at a conference in Brussels on 13 February, set out its agenda on issues such as social exclusion and retirement schemes. How confident is the Minister that he will be able to resist this proposal and other, more ambitious proposals under the Swedish presidency and the Belgian presidency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, there was no qualified majority on this proposal and nothing has changed since November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All European states signed up to the Lisbon recommendations to make Europe the best place for a knowledge-driven economy. If we consider every proposal and measure in terms of how many jobs it will create—we are committed to reducing unemployment dramatically in the European Union in the next 10 years—and introduce benchmarking, best practice and so on instead of regulation, we should arrive at a position where the measures that the hon. Lady
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
suggested would not impose too great a threat. There is a place for regulation, but it must be in the context of better ways of progressing with the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A new social agenda was agreed under the French presidency and we signed up to that. The Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities, my right hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Ms Jowell), and I had an input to that, which shows the difference between engaging with Europe and putting our arguments, and sitting on the sidelines. That new social agenda commits the Swedish and Belgian presidencies and the following presidency to an agenda of benchmarking and best practice and not particularly regulation. There is a place for regulation, but, too often, we have used regulation when better methods were available to achieve the desired result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there are no more questions, I call the Minister to move the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of the unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum from the Department of Trade and Industry dated 21st November 2000 relating to a draft Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community; and supports the Government's position that it is not persuaded of the need for a directive on information and consultation in undertakings operating only at national level, which is difficult to reconcile with subsidiarity and would cut across existing practices in member states to no benefit.—
	<i>[Mr. Johnson.]</i></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>11.8 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here we are in the Committee in the unusual position of discussing an issue on which the Government and the Opposition agree, although I cannot speak for Labour Back Benchers. The motion states that the Committee takes note of various documents and the Opposition are happy to do that. It then states that the Committee
	<br><blockquote><p>"supports the Government's position that it is not persuaded of the need for a directive on information and consultation in undertakings operating only at national level, which is difficult to reconcile with subsidiarity and would cut across existing practices in member states to no benefit."</p></blockquote>
The Opposition fully and wholeheartedly support the motion, but we are not persuaded of the need for the directive, so we can support the motion with our conscience intact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a set of laws would be unhelpful and over-prescriptive. The Government stated in paragraph 11 of the regulatory impact assessment on the directive that
	<br><blockquote><p>"employee involvement can take many forms and should reflect the circumstances and requirements of individual organisations … A single framework across Europe cannot accommodate the great diversity of industrial relations practices".</p></blockquote>
That is absolutely right. Conservative Members support progressive employers who keep their employees informed because that is the best way to run a business and it has beneficial effects. However, whether one needs laws prescribed from Europe or Whitehall to force it on employers and organisations is
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
another matter. Such matters are better dealt with by voluntary agreements between employers and employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost to business of implementing such a directive would be staggering, as my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh) intimated. According to the Government's figures, it would involve recurring annual costs of between £209 million and £261 million and one-off set-up costs of between £84 million and £88 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hesford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would the hon. Gentleman estimate to be the cost to an employee who is turfed out on to the street by a company that has restructured without informing its employees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be shabby practice, and there have been recent examples in the car industry—although there are hints in the press that the leaking of information to the media before it was formally given to employees was largely the result of bad practice in the Department of Trade and Industry. It is wrong for such matters to be badly handled. However, the more prescriptive one is, and the more laws one piles on, the less likely it is that the economy will flourish and that people will find it easier to get new jobs after losing them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ivan Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman thinks that it should be up to companies voluntarily to adopt procedures for informing and consulting their employees. What would he do if they did not adopt any such procedures? Would he allow employees to be treated as they were during the 18 years in which his party ruled the country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: During those 18 years, Britain was turned from an economic basket case into a highly successful international economy. That was achieved partly by ensuring that we had much better industrial relations than those that we inherited from the previous Labour Government. Under the previous Conservative Government, a record low number of days were lost owing to industrial action. That was a tremendous success. One of the great problems in the 1970s was that too much trade union power damaged industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the Minister's response to my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York about the cost of implementing the directive. He said that costs were not a factor in his mind, as if they were irrelevant. That does not surprise me, because the Government have been piling huge costs on to business. The estimated cost of implementing the directive—£209 million to £261 million a year—is twice the cost of implementing and running the working families tax credit, which, according to the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, is causing enormous problems for the very people it was designed to help. Employers are refusing to take on people who qualify for the benefit because of the administrative burden that it constitutes, and sacking or reducing the hours of employees who take it up. That was predicted by members of the Standing Committee considering the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Bill that introduced the working families tax credit. It is a foreseen consequence of imposing such draconian measures on businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hesford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that if the NACAB report is at all accurate, or indicative of a widespread practice, Conservative Members support employers who are undertaking those disgraceful practices to get round the rights of workers who want to access the working families tax credit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, we do not support them, but it was reasonably foreseeable that it would happen in the harsh economic world that we live in. We would return the working families tax credit to a benefit that is paid by cheque or standing order into people's bank accounts and sent to them at their homes, so that they do not have the humiliation and difficulty of having benefits paid through the payroll at work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members are drifting on to the working families tax credit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your stricture, Sir David. I was merely responding to questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of the working families tax credit—£100 million—is small compared to the cost of the directive, which has been estimated at between £209 million and £261 million. That is yet another burden on business, which has accumulated over the past four years to some £5 billion a year and has pushed Britain down from fourth to ninth place in the competitiveness league.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the whole debate concerns the balance between regulation and encouragement, but there are major benefits associated with consultation that employers who adopt best practice use to their advantage. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that those benefits offset the burdens by improving productivity and enabling expansion in the market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. There is a difference between adopting best practice because one realises that that is the best way to run a business—I am thinking of a company such as the John Lewis partnership—and having to read a summary of a law to understand whether one will fall foul of it if one fails to apply best practice. Even businesses with, say, 49 employees will have to read the law to understand that it applies only to businesses with more than 50 employees. That will create a huge burden that will drown small and medium-size businesses. A real crisis is developing, and the last thing that this country needs is yet another law—a £200 million a year law—imposed on business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way again because this is a crucial point. His argument is based on cost, but it is clear that there are major advantages associated with employee consultation. Employers who adopt best practice and consult—whether through a regulatory system or otherwise—have an advantage, and the cost burden that he describes is not an issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the hon. Gentleman's view and to a large extent it is mine, but it might not be that of a particular employer. We live in a free society and work in a free market economy—at least I hope we do. If an employer believes that consulting and informing is the best thing to do in economic terms, he will do so; otherwise, he will not. My concern is the passing of laws. Whether or not consulting and informing constitutes good business practice, it is counter-productive to legislate to force employers to adopt a practice that the hon. Gentleman or some bureaucrat in Europe believes is best way to run a business. It will create a bundle of paperwork that every business in the country will have to read and digest. Such initiatives are creating a crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to this directive, the CBI said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A one-size-fits-all policy for every business employing more than 50 people"—</p></blockquote>
that is what the hon. Gentleman is seeking to impose—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is exactly the type of Brussels initiative that will hinder UK growth, investment and job creation. Companies need the freedom to communicate with staff in ways that reflect national and local customs and practice."</p></blockquote>
I agree entirely with that view. The hon. Gentleman must understand that we live in a diverse society and we do not want restrictive laws that prescribe the way in which businesses should be run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am making these points because the Government are at the heart of Europe and are highly influential in those corridors of power. In order to have such influence, we have given up a vast amount of sovereignty since the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues took office, so we should be entirely confident that the measure will be defeated in the Council of Ministers. The matter is subject to qualified majority voting, so the Government need to muster at least 26 votes to prevent the directive's proponents from achieving the 62 votes needed to pass it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument, does he think that the previous Government were wrong to allow QMV to be extended to this matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know. I am not about to traipse through the history of the European Union. I became a Member of Parliament in 1997 and I shall deal with the matters that confront us today. What I will say is that when the previous Government believed that something was right, we stood up for it. We achieved success because we stood firm—for example, on the question of the rebate. This Government should have taken a much firmer line on various issues. Had the hon. Gentleman read the recent book by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), he would know that when one stands firm one can achieve great success in Europe, even under QMV.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will stand firm on the issue. My understanding is that last year Germany, Denmark and Ireland all opposed the directive, but that support is beginning to wane. Indeed, the Library brief on the matter, which hon. Members will have seen, states:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Elisabeth Gigou, President-in-Office at the Extraordinary Employment and Social Affairs Council meeting on 20 December 2000 which agreed the European Company Statute, is reported to believe that the Germans and Danes are now more positively inclined towards the proposals."</p></blockquote>
I suspect that the Government have realised that support in Brussels is waning, so they are preparing for a climb-down, which is why the Secretary of State has announced a review of UK arrangements affecting collective redundancies. Will that review be a way of fudging a climb-down on the directive? Will the legislation that emerges from the review implement the terms of the directive, but be dressed up as implementing the conclusions of the review? Is this all about hoodwinking Parliament?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are placed in an odd position. If the directive is eventually passed by the Council of Ministers, Parliament will be asked—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hesford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have misunderstood the hon. Gentleman, but I thought that he agreed with the Government's position. If he supports the motion, how can he suggest that the directive will be slid in later? I cannot see how those two ideas can co-exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is really straightforward. The motion states that the Government oppose the directive and we agree with the wording of the motion. However, I suspect—and this is a suspicion that I should like the Minister to dispel—that despite the words used in the motion, behind the scenes the Government have realised that they will not win the battle in Europe. In order to get the legislation through Parliament, they are fudging the issue by reviewing domestic legislation on collective redundancies. We should be placed in an odd position if that were the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the directive is passed by the Council of Ministers because the Germans and Danes have changed their view, Parliament will be asked to introduce legislation opposed by both the Government and the Opposition. Therefore, I hope that Parliament will express its honest belief when it debates the regulations. For example, I hope that the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, the right hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) will vote according to the views that he expressed to the Select Committee on European Scrutiny on 7 July 1999. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have made it absolutely clear in the election and since that the proposals for information and consultation which may come out of the Commission are unacceptable and that we believe in subsidiarity in these areas and we continue to do so."</p></blockquote>
That was the Government's view then and, judging from the motion, it appears to be their view today. I hope that we shall not see the proposals put before Parliament, but if that occurs I trust that it will vote them out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.23 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsidiarity is an important principle. When I wander over the road on a Sunday evening for a quiet pint in the Chiltern Tavern, I hear the customers discussing nothing else. Therefore, I can understand why the Government have taken this
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
position as a result of defending that principle. If the issue should be dealt with by member states, we should let them deal with it. Let us resist the European directive on the matter. However, we cannot have our cake and eat it. If it is better dealt with by member states, then member states must address it. If we do not accept the directive, we must clearly state that we intend to address it in our own legislation as it covers important issues that employees have a right to be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard an eloquent, but strange address from the Opposition. They seem to agree with the Government's position, which has not changed, but they are still trying to contrive objections to it. If the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton were a newspaper editor, he would be running headlines about dogs that did not bite people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found the hon. Gentleman's speech especially strange because it was the Conservative Government who agreed to extend qualified majority voting to the matter. I do not blame them. I think that qualified majority voting is required for the resolution of many such decisions across the European Union, and that it is proper to resolve this issue in that way, but the Opposition cannot have their cake and eat it. They agreed to extend qualified majority voting to such issues, and they must accept the consequence: sometimes the United Kingdom might be in the minority and lose the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested, but disappointed, to hear nothing about the needs and rights of employees in the comments and questions of the hon. Gentleman and other Opposition Members. They did not ask a single question about employees, nor make one statement about employees' need to be involved. The Opposition gave not one hint that they were remotely concerned about employees' rights and needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being slightly disingenuous. In response to one of his hon. Friends, I stated my belief that keeping employees fully informed is the best way to run a business. However, I object to using the law to force that on companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that point later in my speech, when I attempt to demonstrate exactly why the law needs to be involved. However, the hon. Gentleman says that the only time during the Opposition's questions when interest was shown in the needs of employees was when he was prompted by a remark raised by one of my hon. Friends. That is lamentable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will explain why I think that we need minimum standards. I agree totally with my hon. Friend the Minister that it is best when companies build partnerships between employer and employees. Such partnerships must be based on trust, and should be always developing. Each side must be able to offer constructive advice and criticism, and take those on board in good part, to make progress. I agree with that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We nevertheless need minimum standards set in law. It is companies that do not recognise the need for such partnerships whose employees need statutory
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
protection. Employees are most in need of information when a company is in trouble. Even if a partnership has been built up, and there has been continuing discussion, people start to hide things when difficulties arise, and the partnership is threatened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a small engineering company in my constituency got into financial difficulty, its employees came to me because their employer was refusing to give them information. I had to ask the employer to tell me what was going on so that I could tell the employees. The employer eventually sold the company, and it soon became clear that the new owner had no interest in the employees or the company. He had bought it to take its equipment away to prop up other companies that he owned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new owner's long-term aim was the disposal of the company's employees and the closure of the business—but could the employees get that, or any other, information out of him? Were they ever told what was going on or given advice with which to plan their lives? Some of them became frustrated and drifted away from the company. Even if the new employer had wanted to save the company or sell it as a going concern, the breakdown of the partnership and the lack of information created a situation where, from day to day, the company became less of a viable concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we heard earlier, the Opposition believe that companies' procedures for dealing with consultation and information should be voluntary. When I was a trade union official during the years of the previous Government, I had to deal with employees whose redundancy notices were delivered by taxi. There had been no prior consultation or negotiation. We need minimum standards so that people will not be treated as they were under the previous Government, who encouraged such conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is 100 per cent. correct. Minimum standards must be written into law to deal with such circumstances and to guarantee the right of employees to know what is happening. The cost of compliance was discussed, and a figure of £200 million was given as the cost of implementing minimum standards across the country. However, the majority of decent companies already comply with the minimum standard. That £200 million is not an additional cost of compliance but the total cost. The additional cost would be incurred by companies that were not already following best practice and spending money on this. It would be very small, a tiny fraction of £200 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Minimum standards would give tremendous benefits to employees. My hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Henderson) gave the example of a company that bussed redundancy notices to its staff, and I cited an example from my constituency. If those companies were publicly quoted, the shareholders would have been given information that was denied to the employees. Creditors would probably have been
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
given that information—the company owners, acting within the law, would have told their creditors what was happening—but the employees were denied it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As long as employees' wages are paid on time, they are denied information that is given to shareholders and creditors and discussed among the directors. They are denied information about the company on which their livelihoods depend. That is why I believe that we need to have standards written in law. I am prepared to accept the Minister's view that the principle of subsidiarity applies and, therefore, that this is a matter for UK law. However, we must enact it within UK law, and I encourage the Minister to make such a statement today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman continues, I wish to address briefly the point that he raised about the regulatory impact assessment. He is right that 36 per cent. of all work places have some form of consultation process, but the RIA makes the point that it is difficult to know how many of those undertakings will be able to adapt existing arrangements and how many would need to introduce entirely new structures to comply with the detailed requirements of the directive. The problem is caused not by the practice of consulting employees but by prescribing detailed regulations. The law creates the cost, not the practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman leads me to my final point. Because the Government believe in the principle of subsidiarity, they have not negotiated directly. I understand their tactical reason for not negotiating. However, they might suddenly realise that they are going to lose the battle in Europe. They might suddenly realise that other member states were moving towards accepting the directive and that they had to start negotiating to get the best possible deal for the UK. They would then have to go into that sort of detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we should ask for a directive that deals with information being given to employees, rather than with consultation. Were that to happen, I suspect that the cost of complying with the directive would be minimal, as it would only be bad companies, or those getting into difficulties, that would be expected to do something that they were not already doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right. It might be very difficult to establish how many existing companies would comply with the detail of the directive. However, we will not know the detail unless we take part in negotiating on it. Nevertheless, I totally support my hon. Friend the Minister in his contention that subsidiarity is an important principle in this case and that the matter should be dealt with by member states. I also support the resolution, but I would do so with a much easier mind if my hon. Friend were to say not only that he accepted the principle that information should, by law, be given to employees at all times but that the Government would return very soon to the matter, with a view to applying it in the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.36 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to be able to support the Government's position in a spirit of co-operation and consensus-something that, as the Minister will appreciate, causes alarm bells to ring among Conservative Members. If anyone is to be accused of not taking an interest in employees, it must be the Liberal Democrats, whose Benches have been vacated for some while.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not only are the Liberal Democrat Benches empty now, but I can say, as a member of European Standing Committees since the start of this Parliament, that they have at least turned up today. They do not usually do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is interesting but not relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Mcintosh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Minister's attention to the latest edition of 
	<i>Small Business News.</i> It reports a conference that clearly demonstrated that business is already engulfed in red tape. For that reason alone, this proposal should be resisted. I would also argue, and I am sure that the Minister will find it an attractive proposition, that there are other issues of greater concern to employees. A good example is the mobility of pensions—not just those of people working for multinational companies—and I hope that the Minister will forgive my using my personal experience to illustrate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, a number of years after returning to the UK, I received a note from the national insurance office in Newcastle upon Tyne, informing me that it has no record of my whereabouts from about 1978 to 1989. From the correspondence, which I have shared with the Minister and with his colleague, the Secretary of State for Social Security, I can conclude only that the contributions that I made, both to national insurance and to my pension, notably in Belgium for a number of years between those dates, will simply be lost. I am sure that I am not alone in this. During that time, I was both an employee and self-employed. I have always encouraged people to spend at least part of their working life, if not part of their time at university or in training, in another EU country. However, if they are likely to experience this kind of loss they will, regrettably, think twice about doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation in the market place should, as the Minister has said, be kept to the minimum. It is difficult for the state to justify interfering in business, except to set broad parameters for what is, primarily, a personal relationship between the employer and the employee. Each Member of Parliament now operates as a small business, so we can appreciate the problems that such businesses face. We must discharge our responsibilities towards our employees very carefully. For example, if we wish to close down part of an office or move it in or out of the constituency, or to London, we have to consider at what stage to consult them in order to avoid setting off alarm bells. In a competitive situation—more competitive than adversarial politics—getting it wrong could have damaging consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
The Minister will remember that Baroness Thatcher, as Prime Minister and leader of her party, successfully negotiated against excessive interference from the Commission and other member states. She had a number of supporters and admirers among member states—I am sure that the Minister will agree that the handbag technique was successful. She took the flack, while other member states took the benefit. Under my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), the last Conservative Government achieved a flexible labour market. The country achieved an historic level of direct investment. I accept that that has continued due to the golden legacy that we bequeathed to this Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to subsidiarity and I do not understand why the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) has a problem with the concept. Even he, whom I understood to be broadly pro-European from our time on the Transport Committee, must understand that certain issues are best dealt with nationally. This country has agreed that other issues, set out in treaties, can be dealt with at European level but I do not believe that social policy should be one of them. The Minister is absolutely right. I am sure that he has not experienced a sudden conversion on the road to Damascus to make him enthusiastically endorse the principle of subsidiarity, but his endorsement is welcome none the less. I take heart from the fact that there is no qualified majority on the Council of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed legislation is intrusive. We have already discussed the cost of it; I want to return to the issue of confidentiality. If an employee inadvertently or wilfully breached confidentiality, severe financial consequences could follow for the company. The Minister reported that member states are alarmed that sanctions could be imposed to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, but there has to be a penalty to protect a company's negotiating position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the war, there was an expression, "Loose talk costs lives". In company speak, loose talk can cause a loss of confidence in the company and cost jobs. During my time as a Member of the European Parliament for North Essex, later North Essex and South Suffolk, I recall a highly successful public relations company operating in Colchester. It was a medium-sized employer that was competitive and vibrant and was about to be taken over—to the delight and satisfaction of its employers, but not its employees—by a bigger west end firm. The lady who owned the company inadvertently named a number of her most prestigious clients who were then approached by the west end firm and poached. As a direct consequence, the Colchester company went into receivership and a number of jobs that should have been drafted into the London firm were lost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ivan Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady mentioned her time as an MEP for North Essex. As one of her constituents, I remember that period well. Was she aware that during that time, my company voluntarily negotiated a European works council because it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
recognised the benefit of sharing information? That company was Swedish and had trade unionists on the board of directors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh:</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> It was a privilege to represent the hon. Gentleman, and I remember the negotiations that he mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's intervention made the point forcibly, and perhaps more eloquently than I did, that it is fine for a company to choose to enter into a voluntary negotiation. I applaud such agreements because they demonstrate good employment relations in this country. However, it would be regrettable for a company to be forced by law to meet the excessive costs because, as the Minister will accept, the Government will not be giving any handouts. Such costs could mean that the company might lose market share, suffer financial losses or even close.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hesford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the difference between a voluntary agreement being negotiated within one company and the same agreement being imposed as a statutory minimum standard on others? The hon. Lady said that it is good practice to negotiate voluntarily. What would be the difference in the efficacy of business practice, if legislation imposed such negotiation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, that is the fundamental and—one hesitates to use the word—ideological difference between the approaches of the Government and the official Opposition, and it is almost unique for two parties coming from two philosophical backgrounds to agree on such a motion. As was eloquently argued by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, we fervently believe that we must just agree to differ.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will revert to my story and to the moral that the Minister will have seen in it. In that example, regrettably it was the employer who listed her most prestigious clients and lost her business as a result. However, it would be more tragic, even if it were done inadvertently, if employees found themselves in that position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I want to finish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned that the proposal will apply to countries in the European Economic Area and, as I understand, to applicant countries. We have not consulted our businesses directly, but can the Minister report whether discussions have taken place with EEA members and applicant countries on the proposal's implications? The proposal must greatly concern them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am alarmed by the pervasiveness of the social agenda in Europe. I am not just concerned about the present Swedish presidency of the EU—Sweden's social model succeeded, but in a country with a much smaller population than Britain—but about the more ambitious Belgian presidency to come, which wants to focus on work, social exclusion and retirement schemes. I congratulate the Minister on his approach
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
and I hope that he will continue to resist such proposals, which are too prescriptive, inflexible and regulatory. I oppose the directive and support the motion before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.49 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Government's point about subsidiarity. There is a clear need for each country to work through the proposals at its own level. However, I am somewhat disappointed by the general approach of the Government because there would be some advantage in setting minimum standards. My way forward would be to codify the broad raft of laws that already provide for employee disclosure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton inferred from my questions that I supported a one-size-fits-all policy for companies. That is not the case because we need flexibility. I was trying to raise the question of cost. The Opposition's argument concerning the matter does not bear examination. The Government's position is that cost is not the crucial issue: what matters is the way in which each company moves towards a culture of greater employee disclosure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reform is needed. The argument that the law should not apply in this area implies that the laws that deal with redundancy, business transfers, health and safety, pensions and training—all of which already impose legal and regulatory burdens on employers—would have to be revoked. I presume that the Opposition are not arguing for that. Indeed, I assume that some of those laws were passed by the Opposition when they were in government, and rightly so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considerable disclosure is already required of employers, and that obligation already imposes costs on them. That is my point on the cost angle: most of the employers who would be affected by the legislation already have to bear those cost burdens. The draft directive proposes to extend them to the area of disclosure. Although that would add some additional costs, the regulatory impact assessment does not deal with the detail, and its estimate is too high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak from my experience as a former employee of the Port of London Authority and a trade union branch secretary. I worked for the PLA at a time when it was undergoing massive change: the closure of the docks, increased containerisation and the need to change restrictive practices. There was a great deal of industrial unrest and employee difficulties. More than 13,000 people, both white collar and manual workers, lost their jobs. It was a challenge for trade unionists, workers and employers to cope with the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I worked for the PLA from 1963 through to the end of the period of change. During the early stages, industrial relations were generally poor, although there were isolated instances of good relations. There was a diverse range of employers, and the plans that were devised to meet the challenges were not adequately communicated to the employees. Much of the disruption and its negative economic effects on London and on the wider port and transport industry were due to that lack of disclosure. Workers and employers did not get together to discuss the future
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
challenges, such as the impact that the changes in transportation would have on jobs and the ways in which restrictive trade practices might be altered to deal with modern conditions. Even if there had been minimal disclosure, that disruption would not have been nearly as bad as it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were, undoubtedly, bad practices on both sides, but a more progressive approach would have produced benefits. Employers and employees woke up far too late, in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, and a consultative arrangement was put in place across the many sectors of industry. Management and trade unions, and employees who were not represented by trade unions, participated round the table. Information was provided and, in some cases, both sides got together to develop a way forward. I have seen both bad and good practice, and the benefits of the latter. Experience has always convinced me that we should move in that direction. We have not argued about that today, because the Opposition have said that they support best practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is whether there is sufficient best practice throughout the UK, and what can be done to increase it. I welcome the Government's helpful initiative on partnership working and the fund that has been set up. However, there may be a need for a minimum standard, which is why some of my questions led in that direction. I would like to see such a standard set in this country, rather than a Europe-wide imposition. We could codify the existing laws of disclosure to provide for a standard best practice that could cope with the different conditions that apply to small and large businesses. For example, the costs that larger businesses can bear should not be imposed on very small businesses. That is a possible way forward, and we could make progress in that direction in the years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation is a theme that runs through many of our debates. The Opposition often refer to the increased financial burden imposed by the Government during the past four years. Much of it has stemmed from the introduction of the minimum wage and other employee benefits, and the Opposition seem to accept those—they are, at least not arguing that the minimum wage legislation should be revoked. There has been some impact from regulation, but it is not as great as the Opposition claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I understood her correctly, the hon. Member for Vale of York argued for additional regulations relating to pensions to benefit employees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am arguing for a mechanism to require multinational companies to respect pensions. That could be done intergovernmentally. My husband works for an American company and could be asked to work in Germany. He might then face the problem that his pension could be claimed only in Germany.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's point is good, and the matter requires investigation. However, such a mechanism would require legislation, a regulatory framework or a directive, as does the protection of any
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
proper interest—that is my point. Whatever party we speak for, we are seeking to improve things, and that often requires regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a Minister and I addressed a conference of business people in this Room, we received a rough ride about regulation, as one would expect. Strangely, however, while we were mingling with the guests after the meeting, the first business man who approached me said that he would like us to vary rate relief provision—provide an exemption, in other words—to benefit his company. Although he had just argued against regulations, the first thing that he wanted—to protect his own interests, rightly—was more regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to have a more healthy debate about regulation. The question of cost must be balanced against the need for regulation to protect businesses, employees and consumers. We need to develop our laws to provide such protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Vale of York argued about the regulation of industry. Earlier, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, speaking from the Conservative Front Bench, described the worker-shareholder arrangements at John Lewis as an example of best practice. Does my hon. Friend agree that we have slipped into a parallel universe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point, as usual. We are moving that way. It is good to have a debate in which we can discuss such things, and speak from our own experiences, which may influence the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed, because the debate has not moved on as it should have done. The impact of regulations should be addressed because we must ensure that businesses and employees are properly protected and a balance must be struck. If we do not create and encourage an atmosphere in which good employee consultation develops, the country will suffer. The economic benefits of arising from staff retention and training are such that we should not ignore them. We must move in that direction and I am happy to accept the Government's points about subsidiarity, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet said, we need a programme to encourage forward movement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.1 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has raised a number of issues, and I shall try to cover them. We are in a bizarre parallel universe with complete accord between the two Front Benches, but I shall destroy that by returning to normal service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fundamental difference between our approach and that of the Opposition. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton would not disagree with that. The Government believe that we should have civilised standards in the workplace, and, since we came to office, we have introduced a large tranche of changes, including the minimum wage, the right to be accompanied at disciplinary hearings and union recognition. Approximately 24
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
provisions have been introduced; they were long overdue and I have always believed deeply in all of them, although some of my colleagues did not believe in the minimum wage back in the 1970s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one should argue that our stance on information and consultation reflects in any way the Opposition's approach to the matter, but we have tried to achieve a consensus on all the measures that we have introduced. We want to ensure that no right-of-centre mainstream political party in this country, or elsewhere in Europe, would dare to remove those fundamental rights once they are established. Having introduced so much in such a short period, we must recognise the effect on business of taking our agenda further. I do not go along with the mantra that regulation is a burden on business if it covers social progress, but we must ensure consensus, by and large, on the measures that we introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the minimum wage and other employment rights issues, we have achieved consensus, and, although I am a bit foggy about the Conservatives' policy on the minimum wage, I doubt that even they would dare to remove it. The Conservative party has been through a policy-making process known as the Portillo process, and I am not sure whether it would protect the minimum wage in all companies with no sectoral or regional variations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Government did not believe in the fundamental rights that we have introduced. They may have believed in good, decent employers being kind to their staff, but they removed wages councils and attacked free, independent trade unionism, which is the best safeguard of workers' rights. I must make that point because it is relevant to burdens on business. The previous Government introduced a regulation under which every company had to remind its work force that union subs did not have to be paid by check-off. The company had to write to each individual whenever union subscriptions were increased. Every three years, the company had to pay the cost of the union effectively re-recruiting its members. That placed a terrible burden on business, and the measure was spiteful, petty and designed to undermine free and independent trade unionism. Thankfully, we have repealed it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ivan Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the case has been proved in respect of the European works councils. The Conservatives used political dogma and fostered anti-employee relations. Industries that were against the measure signed up to it, regardless of whether there was a voluntary or regulatory burden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point that I was about to mention. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to the position of the Conservatives, who opted out of the social chapter. In fact, the European works councils directive was a good example of a mistake by the previous Government. The directive was negotiated, and companies that operated in other parts of Europe as well as in this country were affected by it. Because the UK Government had opted out, such companies
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
had no input and the directive proved a fait accompli. That is a classic example of the faults of the previous Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further example of such faults is the working time directive, which the previous Government were able to influence because it concerned health and safety. They approached the European Court of Justice, claiming that the directive should relate to the social chapter, but they were humiliated. All that the party of the family achieved was the right to a day off that could be any day of the week, rather than just a Sunday. In every other sense they were completely and abjectly humiliated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the trade union reforms of the previous Conservative Administration, only some of which the Government have repealed. If they disliked the package, which included a ban on the right to secondary picketing, why did they not repeal it in its entirety?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the moment, no one would dare interfere with James Prior's reforms of the closed shop and secondary picketing, the requirement to ballot before strike action, and the requirement to ballot the executive council. Those reforms were necessary and I have argued that many trade unions should have pursued them voluntarily—indeed, many did. However, there is a world of difference between those reforms and the seven employment Acts that followed. They were progressively spiteful, and in the end even employers were embarrassed to implement them. They were an attack on free and independent trade unionism, and the Conservative party should be ashamed of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore clear that a different approach can be taken. Indeed, the question of whether to pursue this initiative must be seen in the context of the approach that we in this Committee take to this issue. It is particularly relevant at the moment and people are genuinely concerned about it, but that has not always been the case. In terms of the White Paper "Fairness at Work" and the question of the employment relations package that a Labour Government would implement, information and consultation did not even register on the Richter scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, in the past 10 years the only occasion on which this issue has been debated at a Trades Union Congress was in 1993, when one Mr. A. A. Johnson, a young trade union general secretary from the Union of Communication Workers moved a document on employee participation and industrial democracy. I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Looking at the history of industrial democracy in Britain, it is hard to escape the conclusion that disinterest is nothing new. Since the Guild Socialists"—</p></blockquote>
I apologise for using that word—
	<br><blockquote><p>"pursued the idea at the turn of the century, industrial democracy has been a recurrent theme, but at every stage where workers in Western Europe moved a step closer to genuine social partnership, trades unions merely stepped aside."</p></blockquote>
The people who came to support me in the debate—although no one ever opposes a motion to the TUC—reflected views that existed right up to the present day, or at least until very recently. One delegate said:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Here we come to another popular but I think dangerous argument which is that by being the best organised group in the work force and running states in the elections, trades unions can occupy leading positions within works councils and works councils will therefore act as mutated form of a trades union."</p></blockquote>
She concluded that
	<br><blockquote><p>"works councils are designed only as a forum for exchanging information and for consultation."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friends will have heard the argument that civil rights at work are obtained only through a union card and that anything that threatens union power will diminish workers' rights. The delegate concluded that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the very same works councils that the TUC has argued for and helped come into being will be used against us to weaken and marginalise the role of trades unions in the work place."</p></blockquote>
The matter must be addressed, but we should not let anyone pretend that it has been a burning issue in the labour movement, the TUC or the trade unions in years past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton suggested that the review that was announced on 18 January was a fudge and a climb down. We have argued that the directive breaches subsidiarity. We should review the working of the existing legislation that contains provisions for information and consultation—including the redundancy Acts and the European works councils directive—before we decide how to move forward. It is not a fudge or a climb down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering the concerns that have been expressed about what happened at General Motors in Luton and at Ford. It was disgraceful to inform the work force over the radio about decisions that would affect their working lives. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton told me that we should have contingency plans. On one hand he tells us that we should have contingency plans, but on the other he accuses us of fudge and climb down. I assure hon. Members that wherever the debate on the directive takes us, we will keep the European Scrutiny Committee informed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Vale of York mentioned confidentiality and enlargement. We understand the sensitivities that surround confidential issues and disclosures. The directive contains provisions to protect against damaging disclosures. We believe that the provisions that we put into the European works councils directive are the proper way to deal with breaches of statutory duty. Other European states are concerned that they should be able to use their own legislation to address the problem, not a catch-all provision from the Commission.

On enlargement, we do not know what consultation the European Economic Area and the applicant countries have undertaken in their own countries, but they would sign up to all the directives that apply in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
European Union, including this one. The Commission is working with them to help them to prepare to accept their obligations on joining the EU.

I am glad that my hon. Friends the Members for South Thanet and for Upminster (Mr. Darvill) understand our point about subsidiarity and realise that although we oppose the directive, we are in favour of information and consultation. I hope that they agree that we must take the matter forward in such a way as to ensure consensus. That would not be achieved by implementing the kind of structure that we have seen before as a result of the Bullock report and the industrial democracy experiment. Indeed, that would positively damage what we are trying to do in changing the climate of employment relations.

My hon. Friend the Member for Upminster asked whether there is sufficient best practice. There is a lot of it about, but it has never been sufficiently passed around—as we discovered in respect of the work and parents Green Paper. We talked to companies of all sizes and found some splendid ideas about how people can work more flexibly, but they had never been exchanged with anyone else. It is important to exchange such information.

We believe that the European Union should leave member states free to foster domestic arrangements in keeping with their national traditions. The directive would not achieve anything that could not be achieved by member states acting alone. It would require the establishment of formal structures and new patterns of employee representation. UK companies tend to manage employment relations through less formalistic procedures and structures than is common on the continent. The directive does not address the real issues and is unlikely to fit well into the UK domestic setting.

We have made our position clear to our partners in Brussels, which is why there has been no agreement on the text first proposed by the Commission in November 1998. In opposing the directive, we are not opposing the aim of promoting information and consultation of employees. We take issue with the means, not the end. I urge the Committee to support the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Resolved,</i></p>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of the unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum from the Department of Trade and Industry dated 21st November 2000 relating to a draft Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community; and supports the Government's position that it is not persuaded of the need for a directive on information and consultation in undertakings operating only at national level, which is difficult to reconcile with subsidiarity and would cut across existing practices in member states to no benefit.</p></blockquote>
