	<div class='legislation'>Draft Aeroplane Noise Regulations 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Aeroplane Noise Regulations 1999.</p></blockquote>
May I say what a privilege it is, Mr. Hood, to serve for, I believe, the first time under your chairmanship?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are made under the provisions of the European Communities Act 1972 and bring together, in a single measure, the noise certification requirements of four European Council directives currently implemented in three separate statutory instruments. They will also implement, for the first time, the requirements of a fifth directive and will replace a large part of the Air Navigation (Noise Certification) Order 1990, the whole of the Aeroplane Noise (Limitation on the Operation of Aeroplanes) Regulations 1993 and the Aeroplane Noise (Limitation on the Operation of Aeroplanes) (Amendment) Regulations 1994.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Noise standards are agreed within the International Civil Aviation Organisation, promulgated in volume 1 of annexe 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation 1944—the Chicago convention—and implemented by the individual contracting states in their own territory. Legislation to apply ICAO noise standards in this country has existed since 1970. The international nature of aviation is such that measures to control noise are most effective when they are co-ordinated across national boundaries and we have supported European legislation to apply the standards agreed in ICAO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the early 1980s, the European Union adopted a Council directive that required each member state to ensure that by 31 December 1986 subsonic jets using its airports met at least the chapter 2 standards. This directive was amended, its key dates being 1 January 1987, when a member state's subsonic jets were required to meet at least chapter 2 when using airports in other member states, and 1 January 1988, when jets, wherever registered but using EU airports, were also required to meet the chapter 2 standards. In 1989, a directive required member states to ensure that its carriers did not add to their national registers heavy, subsonic jet aeroplanes which met only the lowest, chapter 2 noise standard. Following agreement reached at the ICAO assembly in 1990 a fourth directive required member states to prohibit the use of older subsonic jets that did not meet the higher chapter 3 standard. Under this directive chapter 2 aeroplanes may be used after 1 April 1995 only if they are under 25 years old or are exempted. After 31 March 2002, only
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
chapter 3 aeroplanes will be able to be used other than in the most exceptional circumstances. The fifth directive, adopted last year, amended directive 92/14. The principal effect was to provide a mechanism for updating the list of specified aeroplanes from the developing nations exempted from the ban.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations unify the requirements of all those directives. There is little in the regulations that is new and nothing that places additional burdens on either the aviation community or the regulatory authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations do not apply to helicopters, supersonic civil aeroplanes and microlight aeroplanes. The ICAO noise standards for helicopters, noise limits on new types of supersonic aeroplanes and the UK's own national noise standards for microlights all remain in place in the Air Navigation (Noise Certification) Order 1990. However, we shall retain the requirement that future supersonic aeroplanes will meet the appropriate ICAO noise limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no easy solutions to the problems of noise from aeroplanes but our noise certification policies have made a real contribution to alleviating the problem over the years. While these regulations involve no direct increases in noise stringency they do consolidate and unify in a single measure the standards covering the vast majority of aeroplanes currently flying in the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.34 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Essex)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the Minister in welcoming you, Mr. Hood, to the Chair and thank her for her exposition of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to "our noise regulations", by which I think she means the British noise regulations. The regulations before us reflect the accumulated wisdom of previous Governments, including that of the previous Conservative Government, who spent 18 years in office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not fall into the trap of agreeing every European regulation or directive on the basis of transnational considerations. There are certainly transnational considerations in these regulations that are provided under international treaties, but it is not necessary to include every international obligation that affects member states in European Community law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no argument in principle with the regulations, which we regard as a consolidating measure, but will the Minister confirm that they propose no new measure and that there is no inadvertent extension of competence? I am sure that she is aware that the European Commission looks lustfully at national discretions for the negotiation of international air transport arrangements. We know that the Commission's long-term aim is to gain control over the negotiation of airport slots—especially across the Atlantic—and we must be vigilant to ensure that it does not create circumstances that make it more difficult for us to resist the encroachment of its competence. I draw her attention to a recent court case on the air carriers' liability regulations, which the Government lost. A United Kingdom court ruled that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
the Commission's regulations on air carrier liability in relation to passengers were beyond the competence of the treaty. The Commission has therefore promulgated, and the Council has agreed, a regulation that is ultra vires the treaties. It will be interesting to see whether the Government respond to that or simply deny that the regulation is null and void.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received complaints from the airline industry about insufficient consultation. The original consultation document was issued in 1997, but the industry has been taken by surprise by the emergence of the regulations in the past week or two. British Airways, whose chief executive is, I believe, a good friend of the Government, did not know until today that the Committee was to debate the regulations. It is not satisfied that it has been able to complete the research that it would usually conduct. What representations has the Minister received from BA or from other interested parties? If she has received none, it would confirm that people did not know that the Committee would debate the regulations. Has the British Air Transport Association been formally consulted, or do the Government rely on earlier consultation documents and the supplement that was released on 26 March, hardly more than a month ago?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only last week the Prime Minister delivered forceful assurances on the way in which regulations would be dealt with. In the foreword to what the Better Regulations Unit's website describes as an "Important Announcement"—I am sure that it is if it is issued by the Prime Minister—he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have therefore decided that no regulatory proposal which has an impact on business, charities and voluntary bodies should be considered by the Government without a thorough assessment of the risks, costs and benefits, a clear analysis of who will be affected and an explanation of why non-regulatory action would be insufficient. This requirement applies whenever Ministers or their officials are seeking to clear a new proposal for primary or secondary legislation or a negotiating line that will result in such legislation."</p></blockquote>
He goes on to say that the impact assessment
	<br><blockquote><p>"should include a clear statement of the objectives of the regulatory proposal and its likely effects. It should demonstrate that the proposal is the most effective means of meeting the state objectives, set out the costs and benefits of the proposal, and identify who will be affected."</p></blockquote>
Most important, he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It should usually be published for consultation at an early stage so that it is open to comments, improvements and corrections by an interested party."</p></blockquote>
The regulations have not been available to the industry for enough time. If they are only a consultation measure, the Committee need not detain the Minister on that point, but I hope that the letter of the Prime Minister's intentions rather than the spirit will be followed. People will have confidence in the Government's determination not to over-regulate only if the letter is observed. The Government have enacted no fewer than 2,700 new measures in under two years but have scrapped only 20, so business is rightly wary of the regulatory burden that the Government are piling on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule on page 15 of the regulations lists aeroplanes from developing nations that are excluded from the noise controls. Among them is Iraq, with
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
which our relations are not terribly good at the moment, and Libya. I am told on pretty good authority that if we saw an Iraqi aircraft coming in this direction we would shoot it down rather than wait to hear how noisy it was. I am at a loss to know why Saudi Arabia should be treated as a developing nation. It is one of the richest countries in the world, so why are we providing exemptions for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.42 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Desmond Swayne 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(New Forest, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding of regulations 8 and 9 is that non-noise certificated jets may no longer be used? Is such a provision in place? If not, how much notice has the industry had of the regulations, and what estimate has the Minister made of their cost to the industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.43 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Brake 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's comments and we support the regulations in principle, but I have a number of questions to which I hope she will respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the points that have been made about consultation. Three airlines have told me that they were not consulted about the regulations, so I would welcome confirmation of who has been involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain the reasoning behind the exemptions for the aeronautical industry and the transportation of large items. It would be argued that power station turbines that had to be carried by air should be exempt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister assure me that there is no possibility of humanitarian flights being misused by a commercial flight carrying a small amount of humanitarian aid and thus qualifying as a humanitarian flight?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How many aircraft qualify under the historical interest category? I understand that there has been no abuse, but unless we are aware of the number we have no means of checking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are exemptions for carriers' operations that are adversely affected to an unreasonable extent. How many carriers have qualified for that exemption? It would also be helpful to know how many carriers have qualified for technical exemptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like assurance that there is no scope for other parties to use the aircraft listed in regulation 13 as a flag of convenience. At least one of the airlines to which I spoke thought that the regulation might be a back-door means that operators other than those from developing countries could use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain the relevance of the regulations, because I understand that many airports, certainly across Europe, are unilaterally adopting noise standards that are more stringent than those proposed in the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.46 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been corresponding with the Minister for two years about aircraft noise. She has always been assiduous and helpful. My heart therefore gave a little leap when I saw that the noise regulations were to be debated this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read the regulations with great care and realised that one of the problems is defining whether they apply to the kind of light aircraft about which the Minister and I have corresponded. The regulations state that they apply
	<br><blockquote><p>"To any civil propeller-driven aeroplane registered in the United Kingdom and falling within one of the categories set out in Volume 1 of Annex 16/1981."</p></blockquote>
That refers to annexe 16 of the Chicago convention, signed on 7 December 1944, as amended. Not surprisingly, the Library does not have a copy of the convention, so it has not been possible to consult volume 1 of annexe 16. Will the Minister confirm whether light recreational aircraft are covered by the regulations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two official airfields in my constituency—I say "official" because a large proportion of my constituency consists of Britain's largest military training area, Salisbury plain, although the military uses innumerable unofficial landing sites, especially for helicopters. The first is Boscombe Down, which is used by fast jets and military variants of civil aircraft, which are astonishingly noisy. In the national interest, my constituents tolerate that for five days a week or for seven days a week when security is tense. I rarely receive a complaint about aircraft using Boscombe Down airfield, which is owned by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other airfield, Old Sarum, the oldest operational airfield in the country, is the principal cause of complaints, although few of my constituents want it to close. Light aircraft use it seven days a week and the flying club that owns it uses it to train pilots, so circuits and bumps are performed every Sunday afternoon, which is understandably irritating to a significant number of my constituents. The local authority has expended much effort and taxpayers' money on trying to find a solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted, therefore, to read that aerodromes would be included in the review, including those used primarily for recreation, but the integrated transport White Paper said hardly anything about airfields used primarily for recreation. I wrote to the Minister to express my disappointment. In her letter of 9 January 1998, she confirmed that
	<br><blockquote><p>"we shall consider the question of noise at aerodromes generally, including those used primarily for recreation."</p></blockquote>
She explained that the Government continue to pursue a dual-track policy
	<br><blockquote><p>"to secure international agreement on the lower noise levels for light aircraft which modern technology makes possible"—</p></blockquote>
such as varying the shape of propellers and modifying engine noise, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"to develop guidance to make pilots, airfield and air traffic managers even more aware of the need to operate in an acceptable manner."</p></blockquote>
So far, so good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the White Paper, "A New Deal for Transport", was published, I wrote to the Minister saying that I was upset about the omission of light aircraft noise. She courteously wrote back and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We certainly would not rule out inclusion of aerodromes used primarily for recreation."</p></blockquote>
That is all very well, but the problem, which affects not only my constituency but others throughout the country, remains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two reasons why the Government should tackle the problem. First, there is now much more recreational flying. Most people like to see light aircraft flying around, but for those who live around airfields the problem is very wearing and is likely to become worse as the number of light aircraft increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, other countries, especially those in the European Union, are insisting on tighter standards. California and some of the lander in Germany are insisting on much quieter aircraft. That can be achieved on all but historic aircraft, for which modifications are prohibitively expensive, but kits costing £1,000, or £2,000 at most, are available for most light aircraft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that we are debating the commercial airports such as London, Luton and Stansted and regional airports such as Manchester, Newcastle and Middlesbrough, for which there is increased demand, but I implore the Minister not to forget the growing nuisance of light aircraft, which is particularly bad in summer when people like to be in their gardens and have their windows open. It is not a grand problem for the Government, but because it has been ignored for too long—including by my Government—I ask her to look into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In her letter to me of 12 February, the Minister mentions
	<br><blockquote><p>"the proposed new legislation on aircraft noise."</p></blockquote>
The regulations are not the new legislation that she had in mind because in opening she said that there is nothing new in them, so what is the new legislation, when will it come into effect and what consultation will there be to improve the quality of life for my constituents and for those of all hon. Members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.53 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall begin by responding to the hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key), with whom my Department has been in correspondence for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every member of the Committee will have received representations from constituents on the issue of noise as a pollutant, in which aircraft will have been a central cause of complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope soon to consult environmental groups, bodies representing aviation interests, Members of Parliament and anyone else with an interest on new proposals for legislation. Our integrated White Paper included proposals allowing my Department to take powers to help airports to enforce mitigation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0554">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
measures—for example, acting against non-compliant operators and enabling local authorities to enforce noise mitigation agreements. However, where airport operators have in place adequate noise abatement measures the new legislation may not be relevant. We are conscious of the difficulties and we shall consult.

The opening remarks of the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) were surprising—I thought that this was going to be the first time that he had welcomed legislation. He made, however, a typical contribution. He inevitably took a Europhobic, almost xenophobic, approach to the regulation. Given the interest that he claims in the subject, I was surprised that he was not aware of the Government's stance on the Commission's proposals to obtain a mandate that it has failed to obtain from member states, which would enable it to enter into bilateral negotiations with third countries, in effect removing the locus of the member state. A report was published by the other place and the Government have responded to it; we have made our position abundantly clear. We do not support, and neither does any other member state, the Commission's proposals.

The hon. Gentleman referred to a case on air carrier liability, which, if it is the one of which I am aware, the Government won. The aviation industry tried to have its case heard in the European Court of Justice, but its request was denied. I understand that it intends to appeal, which the Government will contest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman accused the Government of failing to consult. I was at pains to point out that the regulations have been in legislation for a considerable period. They bring four existing pieces of legislation that have been in existence since 1990, 1993 and 1994 into one measure. The only new regulation is the fifth regulation. Regulation 13(2) restricts sub-leasing of an aeroplane on the developing nations list to persons established in the schedule, which has the minor beneficial side-effect of simplifying procedures under which we issue permits to foreign carriers to the United Kingdom. Regulation 24 recognises the validity of the exemptions granted by the United Kingdom to third country carriers under the 10 per cent. rule. The most significant effect of the new directive is to amend an earlier directive to allow the schedule of exempted aeroplanes from developing nations to be updated. Nothing in the regulations places extra burdens on the Secretary of State, the Civil Aviation Authority, aeroplane operators or any British airline. I am surprised, therefore, about the claims that the hon. Member for North Essex claimed were made to him by British Airways. The regulations have no impact on commercial airlines in this country. They were thoroughly debated and agreed in 1997. We hold regular meetings with aviation interests in this country, so it is highly unlikely that British Airways was unaware of the new regulations; it is more likely that they simply forgot.

The hon. Members for North Essex and for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) mentioned exemptions. I was shocked to hear that the hon. Member for North Essex would endorse a first strike, without warning, on an aeroplane flying into British
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
airspace. I was even more shocked when his colleague, the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride), said from a sedentary position, "hear, hear." I should, perhaps, return to exemptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under directive 92/14, the new regulation that will become part of the regulations that we are discussing today, exemptions for developing nations are subject to the general United Nations framework of UN policy. The hon. Member for North Essex expressed concern about the inclusion of nations such as Saudi Arabia on the exempted list. The source of the list was a list of developing nations drawn up by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) asked about regulations 8 and 9. Non-noise certificated aircraft have been banned in the United Kingdom since the Air Navigation (Noise Certification) Order 1984. There are no new regulations other than those that I have evinced in some detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not very clear about the question asked by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington about turbines. The noise standards have been agreed in international debate under the auspices of ICAO.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brake</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point was that an exemption seems to have been made for the aeronautical industry, whereby it can transport aeronautical parts in noisy aircraft. Why does it have an exemption for large items when other industries do not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware that there are comparatively few movements in such large loads; permission still needs to be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of aircraft flying without meeting the requirements of chapters 2 and 3, an aircraft is certificated at the time of its introduction as a new aeroplane. The average lifetime of an aeroplane is 25 years, so although new regulations are introduced such aircraft are still allowed to fly. However, by 20002 aircraft will have to meet the requirements of chapter 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington; she moved rather quickly on to the next point. Why is an exemption granted to the airline industry but not to other industries? The Committee is entitled to an explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is incorrect. There are exemptions for other industries. Aircraft are exempted but are still allowed to fly. The size of equipment being moved and the size of the aeroplane required to move it are such that there must be an exemption. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the industry should have to forgo development because it should not be allowed to move equipment on aircraft capable of moving such equipment? A cost-benefit analysis would show that it would be impossible for the aviation industry to continue to play a role in the markets of the world if it had to design an aircraft at enormous cost and be allowed to fly it only after a considerable period.

The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington asked about aircraft carrying humanitarian goods. As I have been at pains to point out, there is nothing new in the regulations, other than its provisions on the restriction of sub-leasing, the recognition of the validity of exemptions and the updating of earlier regulations on the schedule of aeroplanes from developing nations. Nothing in the regulations precludes an aircraft from flying; an aircraft with the relevant noise certification would be grounded only if it was deemed to be unsafe. I am sure that no member of the Committee would argue that an unsafe aeroplane should be allowed to fly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have figures on the number of aircraft that are exempted on an historical basis, but I shall supply them to the hon. Member for Carshalton and
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Wallington. I shall also write to him on the number of temporary exemptions. The figure is not fixed and is affected by seasons of the year and things of that nature. I am not aware of any European airport unilaterally attempting to impose noise standards. No European airport could exclude aircraft from within the single market on those grounds. I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman's hopes have foundered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
