	<p>9.55 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beckenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Stakeholder Pension Schemes Regulations 2000 (S. 1. 2000, No. 1403).</p></blockquote>
I welcome you, Mr. Jones, to the Chair for this brief, final debate on stakeholder regulations before they come into effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Desmond Swayne 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(New Forest, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hallelujah!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you may have heard from a Committee member, Mr. Jones, some of us have spent many years considering stakeholder regulations. Hon. Members may be relieved that they will no longer be involved in the legislative process. You may feel that you have drawn the short straw in having to chair today's Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have prayed against all the regulations, because questions still need to be asked about stakeholder pensions. I hope that I do not stray out of order; it may seem that I am drifting away from the regulations, but all the issues are interrelated. The announcements by the Treasury, for instance, are directly relevant to the administration of, and the regulatory regime for, stakeholder pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government proposed stakeholder pensions along with the state second pension as their big idea for pensions. However, that big idea has had such an impact that, according to Mintel, 58 per cent. of the population have never heard of stakeholder pensions. If they are to be a success in the target market, one hopes that that figure will have decreased substantially by next April, when they are introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been dealing with another problem for a long time: the interrelationship between the stakeholder pension, the state second pension—particularly when it goes flat rate—and the minimum income guarantee will put many people off purchasing this new product. It has taken two or three years of legislative time to produce a new product for the pensions market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have no argument with a low-cost, private sector, fully funded pension. The question is whether it will deliver what the Government want. As I said, we have some difficulties. This Government are grappling, as the previous one did, with the structural problem of the interrelationship between the Treasury and the Department of Social Security regarding the regulation of pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The latest announcement by the Treasury, which has an impact on stakeholder regulations, is about the individual pension account. It has become stakeholder-friendly. I assume that the account was announced deliberately to tie in with the end of debates in this Committee and on the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill. That, too, has an impact on stakeholder pensions. It seems that yet another product is being offered in the range of pension provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swayne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend draws attention to the range of products available and mentions the individual pension account. Members of the public will face difficulty in understanding the range of products available under the regulations. That will lead to a crucial need for advice. Am I right in my estimate that advice will be lacking under the regulations? People are somewhat disinclined to pay for professional advice which, traditionally, has come from the industry and been funded by commission. On account of cost restrictions the regulations will militate against payment of commission to fund advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Perhaps he will forgive me if I do not respond immediately but deal with that a little later as I wish to be brief so that others may contribute to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point about complexity, anyone who knows the slightest thing about pensions, including ourselves as we consider our own pension provision, will know that in the target market people are seriously put off by the complexity of pension provision. While I congratulate the Treasury and the Government on simplifying some of the tax rules governing stakeholder pensions, effectively not one new product but two—the Individual Pensions Account and the stakeholder pension—have been brought into an already complex market, and although the way in which they were devised may of itself be simple, their addition to such a market has heightened its complex nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other aspect that inevitably will have an impact on stakeholder pensions is the Government's decision—welcome though it is—on concurrency. We have always argued for total concurrency. The Government have argued that that would be a tax break for the rich. It is interesting that the concurrency level has been set at £30,000 a year. People could just about be paying tax at 40 per cent. if they earn that sum. If the Government genuinely no longer believe that the stakeholder pension is a tax break for the rich, this sits uneasily with the definition of a moderate earner being someone who earns £10,000 a year. By my calculation, someone earning £10,000 a year is earning only £50 a week above the national minimum wage. I doubt whether people on £10,000 a year regard themselves as moderate earners, but people earning up to £30,000—and they are the bulk of the population—will welcome concurrency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A question, albeit technical, arises over what happens when someone drifts above or below the £30,000 limit. A person could be put in the position of having a stakeholder pension illegally if, for instance,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
he earns £28,000 but receives a bonus that takes him over £30,000—for example, a salesman relying on fluctuating earnings around £30,000. Someone at that end of the market might question whether a stakeholder pension is worth while and wonder how to get advice that would enable them to become a legal stakeholder within the 1 per cent. cap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not spend too long on the broad issues, but before I go on to welcome in detail some of the changes in the draft regulations, I must say that the Government have to think through a bit more fully the potential impact of FRED20, a new accounting standard that will crystallise on the balance sheet a company's liability towards its occupational pensioners. That has a bearing on stakeholder pensions. It appears that this will accelerate the decline of defined benefit pension schemes, something that probably all of us would regret. Unless that is changed, its technical impact is likely to make finance directors look carefully at the occupational benefit scheme that they offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another read through shows, as my hon. Friend the M for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) said, that there is also an impact on the cost of advice. If occupational pension schemes are to be closed, people may wish to transfer it to a stakeholder pension. The Financial Services Authority is not keen on transfers, which are difficult to keep within the 1 per cent. cap. The cost to an independent financial adviser of giving someone advice on such matters is between £500 and £1,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me neatly to other problems connected with the cost of advice. I congratulate the Government on introducing the 1 per cent. cap, as it has encouraged the industry to consider developing services, such as e-mail, call centres, the fax system and post offices—if the new post office bank gets off the ground—all of which have the potential to offer simple, easy advice for people who have simple, easy problems. However, people are different and so are their pension requirements. If they do not fit into that simple advice system, it will be difficult to contain the cost of advice within 1 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swayne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not so much that people are different, but that a person's pension requirements will change over time. It would be relatively simple if, throughout their lives, people fitted into the three income bands outlined in the Green Paper, but they will not. For example, a young graduate's expectations may rise throughout his life. There is a huge potential for mis-selling inappropriate products to people early in their working lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend puts his finger on a problem that I was trying to simplify. He is absolutely right to say that people have different requirements throughout their lives. We could spend time examining whether ISAs are better than stakeholder pensions, but that would be ruled out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1 per cent. cap simplifies the cost of advice offered by the pensions industry, which is welcome. Hon. Members may be a sophisticated audience, but many people in the target market for pensions tend not to be active buyers of pensions or savings instruments,
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
although the Government's definition of that market is unclear. An educational role is needed, but that is expensive. It cannot easily be accommodated within the 1 per cent. cap, even if the details are sorted out on a computer, with people filling in the boxes to work out whether a stakeholder pension would be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people buy ISAs and sales are better made face to face when people's questions can be answered as they arise, rather than in the structured pattern imposed by a computer or a call centre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steve Webb 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Northavon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to preempt the h Lady's remarks, but I want to be sure that I follow her reasoning. I agree with her that advice is needed, that face-to-face advice is a good thing and that it will have to be fitted in to the 1 per cent. cap. Does she, therefore, conclude that the 1 per cent. cap is too low?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is encouraging me to abbreviate my comments. He leads me to ask whether the 1 per cent. cap imposes an inflexibility which will have a deleterious effect on the potential target market. Good advice is needed, but it costs money. One of my anxieties is the difficult position of the Financial Services Authority, which has been invited to produce decision trees to help advisers keep within the 1 per cent. cap in deciding whether people should have a stakeholder pension. The FSA's late May production on decision trees leads me to suspect that someone in the FSA trained in the Foreign Office because the document has been written—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. For the convenience of the Committee, I know that the h Lady will confine her remarks more closely to the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have every intention of sticking to the regulations, Mr. Jones. A great attempt is made to persuade people to buy stakeholder pensions. The problem is whether those at whom the stakeholder pension is targeted will receive the necessary advice in order to take a sensible decision and hence to comply with the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One problem with the FSA's decision trees is that the phrase "seek advice" is repeated many times in the documents. A good decision tree will produce a clear answer, yes or no. But a person completing the FSA's decision tree is likely to be told to "seek advice", thus there will be problems keeping within the 1 per cent. cap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regulation 3, the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority is mentioned as the organisation with which stakeholder pensions should be registered. The FSA also regulates stakeholder pensions, which I hope shows that I am following your guidance, Mr. Jones. Consumers will be confused about OPRA's role. They will want to know whether their pension is regulated by OPRA or the FSA, as the two bodies have different functions. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has serious anxieties because it believes that OPRA is a reactive regulator, a view with which I concur. It does not have the necessary financial services expertise. That is not a slur on OPRA, merely an indication of how it was set up statutorily. OPRA
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
will have difficulty in dealing with the regulation of so many stakeholder pensions. Will the Minister say whether OPRA will need to take on extra staff to deal with its regulatory burden? Will it have the extra income necessary to fulfil its role as a regulator? What relationships are being set up between OPRA, for which the Minister is responsible under the Pensions Act 1995, and the FSA to minimise the confusion that I fear will almost certainly arise?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People taking advice about their stakeholder pension will also need to know whether the pensioner credit, which will come in after the general election, will have any impact on their decision to buy a stakeholder pension. There is the potential for misselling, which we want to minimise as far as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to regulation 5. There is a potential problem here between the trust-based stakeholder pensions and the non-trust based schemes. The contract—non-trust based—schemes are prohibited under regulation 5(1) from restricting membership to particular groups of members, known in the jargon as affinity groups, which are professional or employment groups. That seems odd. A trust-based scheme—for example, an occupational pension governed by occupational pension-type law—is allowed and encouraged, but a contract-based, personal, pension-like structure is apparently not allowed to attract people as an affinity group. That is a great shame. If the Government want to attract people to stakeholder pensions, they should make it as easy as possible for them rather than exclude them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 15, which relates to with-profits policies, caused immediate concern. I understand that initially with-profits policies were not to be included, but that it was later decided that they could be and that the cost of guaranteeing the benefits had to be within the 1 per cent. cap. The Association of British Insurers, which initially drew my attention to this, points out that a with-profits policy has lower risk features, therefore is more likely to be attractive to people who are risk averse, many of whom we believe could be in the target market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears from the regulations as drafted that if a stakeholder pension is to be provided with profits, it cannot be rolled into other with-profits schemes, although that would make it a much easier, more flexible way to provide a stakeholder pension with-profits scheme. It would have to be a new, stand-alone scheme and would require cash to allow the smoothing of investment returns, because that is the way in which with-profits schemes work. However, the fear is that the cash could not be recouped over the lifetime of the scheme because of the low charge. Therefore, although in principle the industry is pleased that it can provide with-profits schemes, this is unlikely to happen precisely because of the nature of the regulations, the advice and the 1 per cent. cap. Given that these types of product would benefit many people in the target market, it seems a pity that they have been excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swayne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend began her comments on with-profits schemes by saying that they were to be excluded. Is it the logic of her argument that that original decision will pertain and that with-profits schemes, in practice at least, will be excluded because of cost restraints?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sincerely hope that the Government are listening to the recommendations that my hon. Friend and I and many members of the industry have offered in terms of making the scheme more widely available to people in the target market. The proof will be in the pudding. Although the Government have seemed to concede, in fact they may well have put up a barrier that excludes people from taking advantage of the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend could help me with a point that I have tried to understand. We were told that the inclusion of with-profits plans could cause difficulties because the companies are owned by their members via their with-profits funds, so all expenses, including salaries, advertising and sponsoring, must be included in the 1 per cent. calculation. Does that worry my hon. Friend?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That comes under the broad heading of the cost of setting up because it has to be an existing stakeholder pension plan rather than being wound into an existing with-profits scheme. That would require set-up costs, and the 1 per cent. cap hits immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have set out to be a better-regulating Government and I have no difficulty with that. However, one problem that is emerging relates to employers' payroll deductions and the relevant regulations 24 and 25 take up one and a quarter pages. The regulatory impact assessment states on page 3, paragraph 12:
	<br><blockquote><p>The main recurrent costs for employers are likely to be the administrative costs of providing information about stakeholder pension schemes, making deductions of voluntary contributions from pay and passing them to a designated stakeholder pension scheme. It is estimated that these costs are likely to range from £10 to £25 a year for every employee who contributes to a scheme.</p></blockquote>
Companies with fewer than five employers are to be excluded. It has been calculated that one payroll change requires an employer to produce four different written notices. I should be obliged if the Government could have another think about whether this is the most effective way to keep their own costs down because four written notices—even under the most liberal interpretation of how much it costs to produce one written notice—will surely cost considerably more than £10 to £25 a year. It is not difficult to envisage a situation in which although many people will not need to change, others will need to do so fairly regularly. We need reassurances that that that aspect will be looked at and simplified. We hope that the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority will be given discretionary powers—which the National Association of Pension Funds Ltd. wanted—to ensure that employers have plenty of time and training to get

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
used to the payroll deduction system so that the regulators cannot come down on them from a great height while they become used to these new systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One last point is that evidence is emerging that the regulations as a whole are drawn in such a way that it is possible for employers to offer a product that is seemingly stakeholder pension-compliant but which actually is not of much use to employees. Independent financial advisers report that some companies are asking about the easiest way to offer what looks like a stakeholder pension-compliant product. One example given to me was a twice-salary death-in-service benefit open to all employees. It appears that the regulations do not cover such eventualities. I should be grateful if the Minister could say whether there is any concern about that and whether he will have to return to the regulatory trail to try to deal with it, or with any other proposals that he may have, to ensure that as many people as possible benefit from the low-cost stakeholder pension product that the Government will introduce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Steve Webb 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Northavon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to comment briefly on two of the regulations, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) will be able to catch your eye, Mr. Jones, to discuss the finer points of trust law, which are beyond me. Regulation 14 concerns charges and regulation 22 is about employer access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the Government, we want to encourage more people to take out individually funded pension products. In general, we are sympathetic to the notion of stakeholder pensions, but we have some differences
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
of emphasis. Both my hon. Friend and I approach the regulations with an open mind and we will decide how we will vote when we have heard the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 14 deals with the charging structure for stakeholder pensions. It imposes the 1 per cent. cap, which means that charges above 1 per cent. will not be allowed in stakeholder pensions. The hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) and the hon. Member for New Forest, West, with his perceptive interventions, raised concerns about advice that I will not reiterate. My key concern is that we are dealing with a group of people who, as the hon. Member for Beckenham said, do not typically buy sophisticated financial products. Typically, they are in a job, still in SERPS, and have not bought a pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and I sat in on a focus group—I suspect that he spends many hours in focus groups, but it was a rare treat for me—of people in the stakeholder pension target market. We sat behind a glass panel and chewed peanuts while we watched members of the focus group discuss stakeholder pensions. It was clear that many of them had other financial problems, such as debts. For example, they were repaying a car or holiday loan at an interest rate of 15 or 20 per cent. I was not convinced that such people would be well advised to take out stakeholder pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those who provide the product are allowed to charge only 1 per cent., and a focus group member's employer decides to make Virgin stakeholder pensions accessible to employees, how can such people be sure that the product offered is the right one for them? Should they put the £10 or £20 a month into paying off the car loan or the store card loan at 25 per cent., or invest in a stakeholder pension? They need advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is especially true given the existence of the minimum income guarantee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I have a lot of sympathy with that point. Clearly, people who can accumulate only small pension pots may be ill advised to take up a stakeholder pension. I understand that the decision trees produced by the FSA do refer to MIG, which is a step in the right direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to pursue the point, but the decision trees do not refer to MIG. They are the introduction. That is the point about the civil servant who is trained for an office. Nobody takes a decision based on MIG.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that someone who picks up a set of decision trees will, in reading the instructions, see references to MIG. That is a step in the right direction. However, I accept that the trade-off is sophisticated and that 1 per cent. is not enough. I tried to probe whether the hon. Lady was saying that 1 per cent. was not enough, and I do not think that I got a very clear answer. She was concerned that it might not be, but I did not think that she was saying that it should therefore be 1.5 or 2 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view is that 1 per cent. is tight. As the hon. Lady said, one cannot get out of the 1 per cent. limit by saying that decision trees will be a substitute. Clearly,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
they are not. I know that the Government regard them as a root-and-branch reform, but I am concerned that one might just end up in a box that says, "Seek advice", so that one still needs advice after following the tree to the end. It is not obvious to people which branch to follow. Many people in the target market know nothing about pensions and have not got a clue what a contracted-out money purchase scheme is, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1 per cent. threshold means that some of those who need advice cannot get it through the scheme. They will not pay a lump sum for it, because if they are not convinced that they need a pension, they certainly will not be willing to pay several hundred pounds up front for advice. We are very concerned about the threshold, and are not convinced that it is high enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second aspect that I want to discuss is regulation 22 on employer access—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's argument that the threshold is not high enough. One of my concerns is that it is so low that insurance companies will not want to take on people earning less than £20,000. Is that his point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not quite my point. There will be people who switch from other products—people who have personal pensions may switch to stakeholder pensions with lower charges. Those who do not need advice, or who have been wrongly advised, may take them out. We know that there are products available at 1 per cent. and below, so I am not saying that they will not come forward. I am asking whether the Government will achieve the goal of getting stakeholder pensions to the target market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On employer access, the decision to exclude firms with five or fewer employees helps to lighten the burden on small employers. However, the Minister clearly did not know what day it was when he signed the regulatory impact assessment, because he had to amend the date. I wonder whether Ministers generally know what day it is when they sign such documents, because the Minister signed the following statement:
	<br><blockquote><p>I have read the Regulatory Impact Assessment and am satisfied that the balance between costs and benefits is the right one in the circumstances.</p></blockquote>
How did the Minister reach that conclusion? The assessment mentions a £100 million up-front cost for the regulations, and then £15 million or so per million subscribers. At what point would those costs become disproportionate? If the people doing the assessment had said that the cost would be £200 million up front, or £30 million or £50 million per year, at what point would the Minister have said, "It's not worth it, the burden on business is too great for what we are trying to achieve"? Are such decisions entirely arbitrary? I am convinced that they are. The working families tax credit placed a similar burden on business—£100 million per year—and the Government just waved it through because it was something that they wanted to achieve. At what point would the Minister have not signed the statement? I hope that he will give me a straight answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
The regulatory impact assessment shows that 750,000 people, or 15 per cent. of the target market, will be excluded because of the small firm exemption in regulation 22. What is the Minister's strategy for extending stakeholder pensions to those people?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of employer access is to make such pensions cheap to distribute. The Government want a product that has low charges, but the industry says that it cannot deliver low charges unless it has a cheap method of distribution. So the Government will implement them through employers, and that is how costs will be brought down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If stakeholder pensions were compulsory for people who did not have occupational pensions, millions more people would suddenly have to buy them. When that happened, the economies of scale would set in and the companies could deliver them at a modest cost, without having to drag in the employers. That raises several major issues that I shall condense into a nutshell. Do the Government rule out making stakeholder pensions compulsory at some point in the future? If they do not, we may not need employer access. If in five years the take-up is poor and the Government are convinced that they have failed to hit the target group, they may make them compulsory. At that point, firms could provide them on a mass scale, and we would not need the £100 million burden on business. I am glad that the exemption will be reviewed in a few years' time. If compulsion is not ruled out, we may not be forced to go down the employer route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key point—this may make me sound like the hon. Member for Beckenham—is that businesses are subject to increasing burdens, many of which we have discussed in other Committees. The regulations will place a substantial burden on employers, but the benefits are unclear. The point of employer access is to keep charges down for the providers, but other mechanisms for doing that exist. Employers will have to recommend a scheme, which is an odd notion for many of them. I have grave concerns about the regulatory impact of the regulations and doubt whether the charging cap will mean that the target market is adequately advised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(New Forest, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) was kind to say that my earlier questions were perceptive. I assure him that that was entirely accidental. I feel with these regulations that I am wandering around in a completely darkened room filled with furniture. If one makes it to the door, it will be the result of a random process, rather than any scheme or strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have several questions for the Minister. I am not sure that I will understand the answers because I am far from convinced that I understand the questions. However, there is an audience for these proceedings, and I hope that I may be of service to them by asking questions that prompt a response that throws some light on the matter for the benefit of the industry. As I said, it will be a somewhat random process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
My first question is prompted by the closing remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham which prompted an immediate response from the Minister. Do benefits such as the death-in-service benefit fall within the stakeholder envelope? My supposition was that they would, and that that ought to be encouraged. That has been a major feature of the four pension products that I have bought, and it has provided considerable satisfaction and security. Does the 1 per cent. cost constraint in the regulations create some difficulty with the provision of that benefit, or have I entirely misunderstood the issue? Will it be possible to transfer final salary schemes into stakeholder schemes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I felt that the question of advice was dealt with perceptively by my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Northavon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Swayne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the Minister's dissatisfaction. Generally, I do not espouse consensus politics and the community love-fest that it tends to spawn. That is, normally, a feature of his relationship, rather than ours, with the Liberal party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have grave reservations about decision trees. The only time that I have ever been familiar with them was when I was doing my maths O-level. People no longer do maths O-level, and this kind of thing was difficult enough when they did. I am certain that the target audience for these products will have little familiarity with decision trees. How can the Minister allay the industry's reservations? Referring to decision trees, Mr. Chris Bellers, technical manager at Friends Provident, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>They are not easy to follow and no one is going to understand them.</p></blockquote>
Mr. Adrian Boulding, pensions strategy director at Legal & General, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>They are no help in deciding which stakeholder scheme to join, or which funds you should be putting your money into.</p></blockquote>
Mr. Hamilton, technical director for the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service said that consumers would be left feeling insecure and that the service would not be able to give advice:
	<br><blockquote><p>If people ask, "What should I do?", we won't be able to answer that.</p></blockquote>
Finally, Mr. John Turton, head of life and pensions at Best Investment, said that decision trees are bafflingly complicated and that
	<br><blockquote><p>The target market will take one look at these decision trees and be scared off for good.</p></blockquote>
I was nearly scared off for good by O-level mathematics and I suspect that the fear factor will be much greater among the target market for these products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also have some questions about IPAs. I am not sure what they bring to the party. They are not so much products as wrappers. What advantage is to be gained by adding such an additional complication? From April, it will be possible to have a stakeholder pension, as well as an occupational pension. Anyone who wants to use IPAs for both will have to open two
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
separate accounts. The pensions manager at a firm of independent financial advisers, Mr. Tom McPhail, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>My concern is that this is adding another level of complication to an already complicated situation.</p></blockquote>
What can the Minister say to address such concerns?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is regulation 15 which covers with-profits funds. On this issue, the Association of British Insurers said:
	<br><blockquote><p>Having been pleased by the Government's inclusion of "with-profits" within the scope of stakeholder pensions, the Association of British Insurers is disappointed to see that the regulations published yesterday will make this very difficult for pension providers to achieve in practice.</p></blockquote>
With-profits schemes will be the most attractive to the target audience and if the regulations make it unlikely that such products will be offered, they are remiss. I should like to hear the Minister explain how the regulations will not inhibit the provision of that product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute of Chartered Accountants has provided me with a brief. I hope that it has been sent to all other hon. Members, including the Minister. It is a cogently argued brief and I shall not go into it in depth. Its basic thrust is that OPRA is not the appropriate regulatory authority for the enforcement of the regulations. It argues that the FSA should fulfil that function. Will the Minister answer the case that was put by the Institute of Chartered Accountants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by offering a word of apology to the hon. Member for Beckenham for not having been here at the beginning of her remarks and to you, Mr. Jones, for being late.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak about regulations 5 and 15, which have already been mentioned but bear further examination. In respect of regulation 15, I shall refer to the impact of regulation 14 in terms of with-profits contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 5 deals with the exclusion of contract-based stakeholder pension schemes from the ability to decide that they will limit their membership to particular categories of employees. That was the result of a concern about the possibility of cherry picking—perhaps by the more affluent potential scheme members—which has led the Government inadvertently to create an uneven playing field between trust-based and contract-based stakeholder schemes. That is the distinction that lies at the heart of regulation 5(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If trust-based schemes can limit their membership to particular professions, unions or affinity groups, why is it appropriate to say that contract-based schemes cannot? Can the Government supply any evidence that contract-based schemes are likely to be more prone to cherry picking, which they have advanced as the principal reason for the differentiation between the two types of scheme? Why do the Government believe that contract-based schemes are inappropriate for targeting at particular professions, trades, unions and so on? It would be useful if the Minister could give a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
detailed explanation of the evidence and arguments that underpin the position that is set out in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 15 deals with with-profits contracts, which were mentioned by the hon. Members for Beckenham and for New Forest, West. The regulations require that schemes that wish to include with-profits funds may not include non-stakeholder pension assets. Furthermore, they require that the cost of guaranteeing benefits must be met within a 1 per cent. cap. My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon expressed serious and legitimate reservations about the adequacy of that provision. That is where regulation 14(4) comes into play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us what assessment the Department has made of the impact of the regulations? My hon. Friend referred to the regulatory impact assessment that the Minister signed. A quick thumb through that does not shed any light on what has been done to assess the impact of the regulations on the use of with-profits contracts or the impact of their diminished availability as a result of the additional regulatory burdens on the overall take-up of stakeholder pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will address those two issues in his response, because they are central to several of the concerns that have been represented to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee by a variety of interests in the industry. If further light could be shed on both matters, it would provide a basis on which to move forward and develop the appropriate products in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we are having a proper debate about the regulations which will affect many people. This is a highly technical matter, and the Government will have to think up a pretty clever advertising ploy to get their product out into the market in a way that the public will understand. As my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West reminded me, in a previous privatisation we had Sid to tell people what was going on. My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham mentioned Fred in her speech. I do not know whether Sid and Fred are related. The public are going to find the provisions very hard to understand, yet they will be of enormous importance to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pity that we do not have a procedure similar to that in the Court of Appeal, in which one can simply stand up and say, "I concur with the previous statement", because I concur with everything that the hon. Member for Northavon said. He has a knack—which, I suppose, comes from being clever—of being able to reduce very complex matters into language that we ordinary mortals can understand. I always found that skill to be the mark of a good civil servant, incidentally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make this point because we are capable of getting lost in the technicalities, and there is one simple point on which we, as politicians, need to focus, and with
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
which the Minister must deal when he replies to the debate. The only thing that matters is to ensure that many more people on low and moderate incomes of less than £20,000 a year take out a proper private pension. I know that that is an obvious point to make, but surely that is what this debate is about. Everything that we have said in the past hour has been predicated on the simple question: will these regulations help or hinder that process?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unsure of the rules of the House in these circumstances, but to be on the safe side I should say that I am a consultant to the Pinnacle Insurance company. I should like to declare that interest. The company will not provide stakeholder pensions, but it might provide some kind of creditor insurance for people who want to take out stakeholder pensions but fall into unemployment. I have, therefore, some small experience of talking to people in the insurance world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I attended a number of seminars earlier this year with people intending to provide stakeholder pensions. I shall share with the Committee the general view that they expressed, which was that they were not, initially, going to target stakeholder pensions on the target market. I found that rather alarming. They seemed worried that they might be accused of mis-selling stakeholder pensions to people on low incomes, for the reasons given by the hon. Member for Northavon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows, through attending focus groups, of the high level of debt in the target market and of the existence of the minimum pension guarantee. This is a worrying point, because it is arguable that it might not be worth while for people of a certain age—over 40, for example—who earned less than £20,000 a year, to take out a stakeholder pension. Such people might be better advised to settle some of their debts. It gives me no pleasure to say that and I hope that the Minister will reply to this point, although I acknowledge that there are complicated actuarial calculations involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when the stakeholder pension scheme has been up and running for a year and the Government announce that 500,000 or 1 million people have joined it, we shall ask for further and better particulars of who those people are, where they come from and whether they are the target market. That is why the regulations are so vital. I do not have a firm view about whether the 1 per cent. cap is satisfactory, and I do not want to plead the insurance companies' view that it is too little, because I am not sufficiently qualified to make a judgment on that. We all have considerable sympathy for the Government's point of view. Given recent history, we need to draw up a tight framework to deliver an appropriately priced, cheaply administered product to the target market of people on modest incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Minister must answer one vital question that has been asked before, but is worth repeating: will those companies have sufficient resources within the 1 per cent. cap to give people in such complex circumstances the right advice, given that the people involved will often earn only modest amounts? I am not sure whether insurance companies
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
will rush to sell to the target market, but I will be happy if the Minister can reassure me that his proposals will be successful. If he cracks this, he will deliver a major public good. It would be tremendous if we dramatically increased pension provision to lower income earners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Government will not admit it, we are all convinced that they are moving towards compulsion. That is inevitable. I do not know how that will happen, but I suspect that younger people will soon be compelled to take out a stakeholder pension. If they are not, the take-up that we need and expect will not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.56 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best to answer the many questions that hon. Members from both sides of the Committee asked. The questions that the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) posed and the way in which he asked them were wholly constructive. I have asked myself those same questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central question is: what is the policy objective? It is to deliver second funded pensions to a section of the population that the pensions industry has by and large ignored. The regulations are some of the working tools by which we will deliver that policy, but they do not set out all the minutiae. We want to deliver a second pension to millions of citizens to make them much better off than they would be under the present arrangements. Some of the points raised must be considered against that bigger picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious that our sitting lasts only until twenty-five past 11. I have some central points to make, but I shall try to answer as many questions as possible because I am able to provide detailed answers. The hon. Member for Northavon pointed out that the date on the regulatory quality certificate had been changed. That was my mistake. I signed both the regulations and the assessment on Wednesday the 24th but, initially, I wrote the wrong date on the assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the opportunity to debate the regulations and I understand that the only means by which the Opposition can secure a debate is by praying to annul the regulations. People who are not knowledgeable about parliamentary procedure can misunderstand such language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said to the Select Committee on Social Security last week, pensions provide for the future. A pension should last for not a few years, but a working life. In the big picture, our aim is to change the ratio of pensioner income from 60 per cent. from the state and 40 per cent. individually funded to the reverse. That change cannot be made overnight; it will be made over a working life as a pension builds up. Therefore, the state of play that we want to achieve will not be finalised until the middle of this century. There must be a suitable second pension for people who can afford to save. What is on offer at present is not suitable, hence the introduction of stakeholder pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, stakeholder pensions form only part of the pensions jigsaw. Parliament is legislating to provide the state second pension, which is related to
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
the stakeholder pension. It starts off earnings-related with a boost for low earners. The long-term plan is to make it a second flat-rate pension, when stakeholder pensions are established. That has not been defined, although we have had lengthy debates. Hon. Members will want further details on that in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, stakeholder pensions are designed to fill a gap. We had long debates about charges being kept at 1 per cent. Full consultation took place. Six consultation papers, including one on taxation matters, were issued last summer, as I joined the Department of Social Security. We received hundreds of responses. The technical papers generated 80 or 90 responses, and I think that one paper received a substantially larger number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have thought deeply about many of the issues covered by the regulations, including access by the employer, the payroll deduction, the minimum payment that must be accepted and the number of times a year that employees are allowed to alter their payroll deduction. At one time, it was to be once every three months, but I thought that that was a ridiculous burden on employers. Employees can now alter their deduction only twice a year. We have tried to meet the needs of industry, because the private sector will deliver this Government policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policy is designed to make funded pensions available to a large section of the population. The target group is not the same as the market for stakeholder pensions; they are separate entities. The target group is those on moderate earnings—the White Paper defined that as between £10,000 and £20,000 a year—who are presently only in SERPS. The market for stakeholder pensions is much wider, because anyone can purchase a stakeholder pension. It could be purchased for a child. Someone could reach working age, having already built up pension provision in a stakeholder pension purchased by a parent or relative. The pension is incredibly flexible to make it a worthwhile, friendly and mass market product. Clearly, the millions of people who need to purchase stakeholder pensions cannot do so if they are not available to everyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that the Minister advances the argument in that way. We accept that the stakeholder pension is aimed at a market that is much wider than the target group of moderate earners. However, he is, in effect, implying that the 1 per cent. cap could apply across the whole of a stakeholder product, rather than per pension. Could 1 per cent. at the higher end cover some of the advice needed at the lower end of the income market or am I reading too much into what he says?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that. I read what hon. Members say and I listen to them. I also read about the issue in the technical and non-technical press. Our policy is to provide second funded pensions for a group of people whom the industry has, by and large, passed by. I shall not go over the many reasons for that, because we all understand them. If stakeholder pensions were only for that group, the industry would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
probably have said, "Forget it!" The private sector would not have been willing to contemplate it because the regulations would have been too restrictive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have bent over backwards to make stakeholder pensions more flexible than people dreamt that they could be. It is true that that facilitates those businesses that will provide the products as part of the big picture. They will make charges and provided that they keep to the 1 per cent. cap for stakeholder pensions, how they organise their business to enable them to do so is up to them. So long as they conform to the regulations, that is not a matter for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People have missed the point in arguing about target groups, because stakeholder pensions are so flexible. The money that can be contributed is not earnings-related, so there is no requirement to be in work. A stakeholder pension can be purchased for a child, because it is long-term and extremely flexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a very bold Minister who said that the regulations were the final word, but I should like to think that they are, although I am living in the real world. Companies cannot be registered to provide stakeholder pensions until October and the product will not be available to individual citizens until April 2001. Information about the mechanisms will be provided for employers and guidance booklets, in which the Inland Revenue and the FSA will be involved, will be issued to potential providers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to make it as simple as possible for a company to become registered as a stakeholder pension provider and to avoid placing on them the onerous burden of having to deal with more than one body in order to do so. Further information will be published to help in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were some misleading headlines following a recent Treasury announcement on IPAs. They are not designed to compete with stakeholder pensions. It is not a matter of one or the other. IPAs as a mechanism increase flexibility for those who are providing a wrapper—as someone described it—for the products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In trying to make things simple for everyone the regulations must be more complex, as we have to ensure that there are no loopholes through which companies can get round them. For example, we are firm on the 1 per cent. cap. Many h Ms have tried to persuade us to bend on that provision, but no one has suggested an alternative. They spoke for various interests—I do not criticise them for that—but no one said, "You should have made the cap 1.25 per cent. or 1.50 per cent., or introduced a two-tier level, then you would not have any problems." We consulted widely on the issue and thought long and hard before deciding on 1 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The straight fact of the matter is that good-quality, blue-chip companies of good repute—household names—said that they could do what was required for 1 per cent. It would be a very bold Minister who said, "Well, a few companies are carping that they cannot deliver because they are not willing to change and compete, but want to carry on in the same old way",
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
because that would leave millions without funded pensions. The proposal has had the desired effect on the industry, and I do not apologise for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the proposal has had a good impact on the market, but the Minister's earlier remarks about the target group being different from the market undermines his argument. The big companies can provide advice for 1 per cent. or less because they can make savings on those at the top end of the market, who are good people to deal with, so they have a relatively modest proportion of the target group market. A company that deals only with the target group market could not do so for 1 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If stakeholder pensions were available only for the target group, the regulations would not be applicable. They are not; they are available across the board. We have to look at the whole picture. The market is endless. The success of the Government's policy will be measured by the target group. At some time a Minister will come to the House and say, "State second pension goes flat rate, because stakeholder pensions are established." They will be established because of a series of factors which must include the target group. That is not necessarily the market for stakeholder pensions. They are two separate issues. Our policy is to encourage the target group to take up second funded pensions. Some firms will organise matters differently from others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some people are becoming worried about the matter. I attended the Council of Mortgage Lenders annual dinner at which the Secretary of State made an impromptu remark in the middle of his speech that changed the whole process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, that is what a lot of people thought, which is why it is important that the Minister comments on that point. We have been told that stakeholder pensions concern those who earn up to £18,000 a year. I have listened to the right hon. Gentleman carefully. Is some finessing going on, such as wealthy people taking out stakeholder pensions for their grandchildren?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions should be brief and should relate to the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point shows that people have not been listening. The fact is that the policy remains exactly as it was in the Green Paper from which I quoted when I went before the Select Committee. The relevant paragraph concerning the target group and setting out the figures is exactly what we are discussing. Obviously, there is a change in earnings, because that was 18 months ago. However, to provide stakeholder pensions to as wide a group as possible is why we went through the process of six consultation papers and have ensured that the regulations are user-friendly, simple and as cheap as possible.

We have been criticised for being flexible. When the Treasury published its paper on the taxation issue relating to stakeholder pensions, it was met by astonishment that the Government were willing to be so flexible. We held discussions on how to deliver the policy. The target group is not the same as the market for stakeholder pensions. The target group is that which the Government must be judged by in respect of the state second pension, for example. No finessing is happening. I am explaining where the policy fits in the big picture. If we were dealing only with the target group, we would need not the regulations that are before us, but a different set of regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beckenham referred to the concurrent figure of £30,000. That does not apply only to one year's earnings, so it will not be an issue for the salesman who earns £28,000 plus his bonus. It applies over a five-year period, so it should not be a problem for most people. It will cover about 90 per cent. of people. People whose earnings increase permanently above £30,000 will have five years to make adjustments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no plan to snuff out with-profits schemes. The one matter that we have been rigid about is the 1 per cent. cap. It is not 1 per cent. for the majority of stakeholder pensions and something else for with-profit stakeholder pensions. There must be clarity and transparency in respect of the pension arrangements. I accept some of the points that have been made by those who want with-profits schemes. It is up to them how they organise their affairs, but the prize of clarity and transparency on the charges is something that we will not give up. We have allowed the with-profits scheme, but the sum must be 1 per cent. People cannot say, "We need a different kind of with-profits scheme, otherwise it will not work". We are offering 1 per cent., and we are not prepared to deviate from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give way to the hon. Member for Beckenham, but if I keep on giving way, I will not be able to make all my points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question is brief. In theory, it ought to be possible to combine a stakeholder with-profits scheme with other with-profits schemes and keep it under the 1 per cent. cap. As I understand it, such a combination was not to be permitted, but is the Minister now saying that he is prepared to permit it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am most certainly not. The 1 per cent. figure applies to the stakeholder fund and should not be confused with other business arrangements. We want clarity, transparency and simplicity. The figure is 1 per cent. and there is no secret way in which to get round it. If the industry decides not to make the necessary provision, that is its choice, not ours. The 1 per cent. figure is not subject to negotiation by different suppliers of stakeholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked about written notices and payroll changes. There should be no such changes. I do not believe that the provision will prove as onerous as she suggests. Employers will have to issue a standard notice on the way in which they will operate payroll deductions. They must also explain any changes to such deductions in the employee request, depending
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
on, say, whether the employee requests a fixed amount or a percentage. Of course, employees can request changes, but at six-monthly intervals only—they cannot keep chopping and changing payroll deductions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that, in some ways, a debate should take place on OPRA. In a sense, there is twin-track regulation: the FSA is responsible for regulating the selling and marketing of stakeholder pensions and OPRA is responsible for regulating the on-going operation of pension schemes. Of course, OPRA is funded by the levy on pension schemes. We have announced the levy rates for 2000–01, and they take into account—as will future levies—the anticipated additional costs incurred by stakeholder pensions. The two regulators are working closely together, so that the arrangements are effective. Although there ought to be no need for duplication, there are, in a sense, two sets of regulations. However, there is no duplication in respect of regulation of the same part of the stakeholder operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want also to answer the hon. Lady's question on death benefits. I asked her to be more specific, because I remembered reading about circumstances in which there is a death benefit in addition to the pension. I shall share that information with Committee members because it is useful and we should be aware of it. Occupational pension schemes that offer only death benefit cover are exempt from the employer access requirement because, believe it or not, they satisfy the definition of an occupational pension scheme provided in the Pension Schemes Act 1993. However, we intend that exemption from the access requirement should be available to those employers who provide the opportunity to build up a reasonable pension, and we shall look closely at the relevant schemes. Such a scheme would not meet any definition of a stakeholder pension of which I am aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be watching out for smart Alec lawyers—lawyers are usually smart Alecs, so I am quite happy to abuse them—who indulge in jiggery-pokery and use legislation to get round the purpose for which it was intended. However, it is clear that the definition in the 1993 Act cannot be changed at the whim of Ministers. Primary legislation would be required and we shall look carefully at the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was made to a letter from the Institute of Chartered Accountants. We have all received a copy of it and we are aware that there are reservations. We have held constructive discussions on the extent of its representatives' unhappiness, and we shall continue to do so. The regulations were made in May and debated in July. They form the basis of the final jigsaw of the legal requirements for stakeholder pensions. It would be an unwise Minister who said that regulations will never require any changes. We shall continue to have constructive discussions, and if a genuine case is made at any time, I shall have no problem with returning to the House to request a modest change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for New Forest, West asked about transferring final salary schemes to stakeholder schemes. One of the rules of stakeholder schemes is that people must be able to transfer other pension
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0202">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
arrangements to them and vice versa at no charge. That is part of the prize of making the scheme simple and cheap—I do not mean cheap in terms of corner cutting. Such transfers will be subject to the financial services regulations, as are transfers that take place now. People sometimes move pots of money and pension schemes around a great deal, although that is not something of which I have experience. One of the conditions of being a regulated stakeholder provider, which people will sign up to from October, is the acceptance of transfers from other pension schemes within the 1 per cent. limit, so that there are no extra charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northavon asked me about the impact of the regulations. If I believed that it would be excessive, I would not have signed the regulatory impact assessment. That is an underhand answer, because it does not tell the hon. Gentleman anything. By the way, I apologise that copies of the assessment were not in the Vote Office, but it was placed in the Library. The key issue is that of expected benefits to citizens—the 5 million people who are currently in the moderate earnings bracket and do not have access to suitable funded schemes. There are also benefits to employers. Many millions of people's employers offer pension schemes. Good employers see them as a bonus. There is no requirement for an employer to pay into a stakeholder scheme, but there is nothing to prevent him from doing so. Second pension provision is voluntary; no employer is required to run an occupational pension scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this point, I should respond to the question about compulsion. We have no plans to make stakeholder pensions compulsory. The system of funded pension arrangements in this country is remarkable—£900 billion worth of people's savings and investments have been accumulated. That is not because the House
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
passed a law saying that it would happen; it happened on a voluntary basis. The starting point of our overall policy is to get the target group into funded pensions. In due course, there will have to be an assessment of how successful we have been in achieving that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northavon pointed out that access to stakeholder pensions via employers does not include employers of fewer than five people. We did that to ease the burden on business. In effect, it takes out 75 per cent. of all the businesses in this country. However, we do not want the three-quarters of a million people who work in those businesses to be denied stakeholder pensions. We hope that they will buy them on the open market from stakeholder providers, who will target their advertising on them. The Government will undertake a big advertising campaign on pension education at the end of this year or early next year, which will cover not only stakeholder pensions, but the whole issue of pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have said on the record, after three years we will review the employer access figure to see how it is working and if anything needs to be done about it. The important point is that people should not be denied pensions. They may get them through trade unions or affinity groups instead of the trust system. They will not get details of access to the scheme or payroll deduction from the employer. In the sensible world in which we live, it should be possible for them to make arrangements to do that for themselves.
