	<p>Cannot have an intervention on an intervention, 1166, 1319, 1518.</p>

	<p>Chair explained that it was difficult to draft an amendment to the clause that would be both in order and capable of being selected, 82.</p>

	<p>Chair has the power, under Standing Order No. 48, to put the Question forthwith if it is felt that the principles and the matters arising from the clause have been fully discussed, 433.</p>

	<p>Clauses, discussing of together, 1007, 1020, 1711–12, 2170.</p>

	<p>Debate can proceed as long as there are right hon. and hon. Members wishing to catch my eye, 1414.</p>

	<p>Debate on this type of amendment must be very limited, 628–9.</p>

	<p>Error in amendment, 129, 130.</p>

	<p>Five, four, three, two or one people are carried in a taxi at a single fare, not at separate fares, 241, 252–3.</p>

	<p>I shall certainly not allow these arguments to be repeated on the clause stand part debate, 1244, 1255.</p>

	<p>If hon. Members wish to converse they can do so outside the room, or moderate their voices, 1351.</p>

	<p>If it did not change the law a clause would be unnecessary, 65.</p>

	<p>If it is desired to have a broad general debate on this rather narrow amendment there will then be no clause stand part debate, 1556, 1558.</p>

	<p>If the amendment is discussed too widely here, it will narrow the debate on the subsequent clause, 105.</p>

	<p>If the hon. Member is not giving way, the other hon. Member may not speak, 708.</p>

	<p>If the hon. Member wishes to discuss these matters now he will not get a debate on clause stand part because we shall have already discussed the clause, 248, 251.</p>

	<p>In Committee there is less need than in the House to make interventions because hon. Members are entitled to speak more than once, 1173.</p>

	<p>Intervention to be kept brief, 358.</p>

	<p>It has long been the custom in the House that sittings Motions are accepted only from the person in charge of the Bill, 1364.</p>

	<p>It is customary for the hon. Member in charge of the Bill to move motions for the Adjournment, 81.</p>

	<p>It is my job to put the Question. If no hon. Member stands up, I automatically put it to the vote, 525.</p>

	<p>It is not for me to rule on the substance of the wording in the schedule, 563.</p>

	<p>It is out of order to discuss the rulings of other Chairmen in other Committees, 458.</p>

	<p>It is perfectly correct that not every amendment which is not selected is out of order, 165.</p>

	<p>It is permissible for an hon. Member to push through before the doors have been locked in Standing Committee, 151.</p>

	<p>Manuscript amendment, selection of, 1980.</p>

	<p>Many of the arguments now being put forward would be better left for a broader discussion later, 262.</p>

	<p>Member, Members:</p>

	<p>Is begining to repeat himself, 110.</p>

	<p>Is deploying an argument that he might wish to deploy on clause 28 and may well find himself precluded from doing so because it has already been discussed, 115.</p>

	<p>May speak on the main Question, and he may move an amendment, 42.</p>

	<p>Must not argue against his own amendment. He may only argue for it, 1047, 1198.</p>

	<p>Must not drag the Chair into these affairs, 1343.</p>

	<p>Not allowed to read the document, 704.</p>

	<p>Not allowed to repeat himself, 784, 954.</p>

	<p>Straying from the amendment, 493, 535–6, 664–5, 721.</p>

	<p>To relate his remarks to the amendment, 14, 24, 29, 37, 158, 248, 318–19, 320, 356, 468–9, 479, 561,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
624, 670–1, 766, 767, 786, 787, 791, 821, 933, 948, 1032, 1192, 1193, 1204, 1252, 1293, 1330, 1555, 1570.</p>

	<p>To return to the Clause, 454, 774, 1224, 1260–1, 1437–8, 1504.</p>

	<p>To return to the Schedule, 601.</p>

	<p>To return to the subject of clause stand part, 1635.</p>

	<p>Motion for adjournment, procedure, 1359–60, 1361, 1414–15, 1427–8.</p>

	<p>Nobody would dream of committing themselves to hypothetical amendments, 72.</p>

	<p>Not in order for arguments to be deployed again, 598, 606.</p>

	<p>Not in order to read newspapers or other material unless it is relevant to the matter under discussion, 1128, 1154.</p>

	<p>Not the custom in the House, or in any of its Committees, to refer to the Public Gallery, to visitors, 1284.</p>

	<p>Notes provided by the Government to the clause are intended to help the Committee, not to provide extra ammunition, 732, 760.</p>

	<p>On Second Reading, the hon. Gentleman is entitled to raise the absence of items in the Bill, 776.</p>

	<p>Once we have debated clause 1 on the stand part motion there is no going back, 46, 49.</p>

	<p>One cannot have an exhibit that cannot be put into a speech—that is, it cannot be recorded or taken down in shorthand and printed, 457, 458.</p>

	<p>Only one Member may be on his feet at one time, 708.</p>

	<p>Soft soap will not make me rule in order things that are out of order, such as personal references to myself, 51.</p>

	<p>The Chair has a discretion whether it selects or does not select amendments that are in order, 67, 70–1.</p>

	<p>The general intention of a clause stand part debate is to discuss the general philosophy of the clause and not repeat arguments that have already been debated, 529–30.</p>

	<p>The law of the land is automatically assumed to be before the Committee, 769.</p>

	<p>The limits of debate are always within the context of the amendment, 605.</p>

	<p>The object of the clause stand part debate is to raise points that have not hitherto been raised, but which are relevant to the clause, 732.</p>

	<p>The Opposition amendments will fall if the Government amendments are carried, 330.</p>

	<p>There is a slight distinction between servants of the Crown present in their official capacity by the Minister's side and persons at the opposite end of the room, 1298.</p>

	<p>We are in Committee, and the Members can, subject to closures and other such things, speak as many times as they wish, 768.</p>

	<p>We could have a wide debate on clause 1, because of the paucity of amendments that are permissible to it, 59–60, 61–2.</p>

	<p>We have already amended this sittings motion up to "clause 36". Therefore we have passed the possibility of amending before that, 54.</p>

	<p>When I think that hon. Members are straying somewhat from the amendment I will call attention to the fact, 33.</p>

	<p>When the Chair says "lock the doors" the doors should be locked and, by definition, one hopes that no hon. Member can then get through those doors, 997, 998.</p>

	<p>Thanks to, 2181–4.</p>
