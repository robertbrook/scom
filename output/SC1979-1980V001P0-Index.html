	<p>
	<b>Chairman:</b></p>

	<p>Committee Procedure:</p>

	<p>Amendments, duscussing of together, 3, 51, 57, 117, 122, 248, 289–90, 395, 413, 431, 441–2, 479, 490, 513, 566–7, 569, 577–8, 581, 688–9, 699, 771, 843–4, 851–3, 857, 859, 875, 901, 925, 927, 935–6, 991–2, 999–1000, 1011, 1019, 1031, 1049, 1155, 1181–2, 1219–20, 1255, 1291, 1305, 1365, 1417–18, 1441, 1466, 1481, 1546–5, 1589, 1631–4, 1645.</p>

	<p>Anything that is relevant to a matter before the Committee will be in order for debate, 1290.</p>

	<p>As a general rule, I do not intend to call manuscript amendments, 3.</p>

	<p>Chair has no power to instruct hon. Members to speak, 941.</p>

	<p>Chair is not responsible whether any hon. Member's speech is understood by other hon. Members, 942.</p>

	<p>Clauses, discussing of together, 1718.</p>

	<p>Difficulties caused when 
	<i>Official Report</i> of previous sittings is not available, 927, 941.</p>

	<p>I hope that hon. Members who are tempted to jump up on points of order either because of the length of speeches or because they are broad-sweeping will bear in mind that the Chair will not accept such points of Order, 616–17.</p>

	<p>I think we shall get into great difficulties if questions are asked of hon. Members who are not addressing the Committee, 135.</p>

	<p>If an hon. Member wants to intervene he ought to stand, 541.</p>

	<p>If the Under-Secretary wishes, on a point of order, to reply to the right hon. Gentleman, it is open to him to do so, 111.</p>

	<p>If we cover too wide an area on this narrow amendment about ACAS, we shall be in the position where it is in doubt whether we shall have a debate on clause stand part, 36.</p>

	<p>It is my opinion that the principle of the clause and matters arising thereon have been adequately discussed in the course of the debate on the amendments, 1512.</p>

	<p>It is perfectly in order for the hon. Gentleman to move a motion, "That consideration of clause 14 be postponed until after consideration of the new clauses", 1288.</p>

	<p>It is the duty of the Chair to ensure that the debates of the Committee are directly relevant to the Questions before the Committee, 213.</p>

	<p>It might be for the convenience of the Committee, as technical points are apt to be brought up, for the Solicitor-General to respond after each question, 1523, 1524.</p>

	<p>It would be simpler for everyone to understand what the Secretary of State is saying if he were allowed to develop his speech, instead of being interrupted quite so often, 1322.</p>

	<p>Light indicates that the debate is being taped for possible broadcast, 117–18.</p>

	<p>Matters awaiting or under adjudication in a civil court should not be referred to in any motion, debate or question to a Minister, 218.</p>

	<p>Member, Members:</p>

	<p>Going wide of the amendment, 141.</p>

	<p>May address his remarks only to the Chair, 113.</p>

	<p>To come back to the Clause, 361.</p>

	<p>To relate his remarks to the amendment, 10, 148, 1369.</p>

	<p>Minister, Ministers:</p>

	<p>Is already not giving way, 1145.</p>

	<p>Neither members of the Committee, nor the Chair can invite a Law Officer to attend, 1216, 1218–19.</p>

	<p>Out of order to discuss as points of order things which are not a matter for the Chair and have taken place outside the House, 114.</p>

	<p>Points of order to be kept short, 115.</p>

	<p>The Chair could not possibly accept a motion to adjourn further consideration on the basis of events that take place outside the House, 110.</p>

	<p>The Chair has not perceived any statement for it to believe that there has been any misleading of the Committee, 635.</p>

	<p>The Chair has onerous responsibilities without having to accept responsibility for what the Government do, or what the Opposition do, 117.</p>

	<p>The Chair must not put up direction signs to the various roads that hon. Members might take, 539.</p>

	<p>The Chair will allow a certain latitude on points of order, but if this is allowed to go on for too long, clearly it will be a bad precedent, 112.</p>

	<p>The Chair would not rule out of order any allusions to ACAS which were relevant to the amendment or clause under discussion, 27–8.</p>

	<p>The Solicitor-General is confining himself to a legal interpretation and not entering into the politics of the matter, 1524, 1525, 1561.</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>The 
	<i>sub judice</i> rule does not apply to legislation going through the Committee of the House, 213, 217, 218.</p>

	<p>There is nothing unusual in new clauses or amendments being put down during the course of the Committee stage, 429.</p>

	<p>Unless a Law Officer seeks of himself to come to the Committee, the Committee is obliged in the ordinary way, to proceed with the Bill, 1216–17.</p>

	<p>We cannot have a dialogue between two hon. Members, 541.</p>

	<p>We must keep in line with the amendment before the Committee, 676.</p>

	<p>We shall proceed much better if the Committee will respond to the Chair, 353.</p>

	<p>When a case is before the courts reference may be made to it but we are in danger of influencing the outcome if we go into details, 192, 213.</p>

	<p>When we have debated the details of each subsection it would not be helpful for the Committee to go over the same ground again, 920–1.</p>
