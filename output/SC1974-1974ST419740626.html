	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (IMMUNITIES AND PRIVILEGES) ORDER 1974</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr. David Ennals)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee have considered the draft instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if we were to discuss all 11 orders together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ennals</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A draft of each of the orders was laid before the House on 12th June 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first 10 of these draft orders, which will be made under the International Organisations Act 1968, will supersede 23 existing ones. With minor exceptions which I will come to later, they do not involve any extension of privileges and immunities already accorded to or enjoyed by the organisations themselves or persons connected with them. The chief purpose of these orders is to place on a statutory basis certain privileges mainly in the customs field, which have been granted administratively up to now. These customs privileges have already been granted statutorily in other orders made subsequent to the 1968 Act. The Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation (Immunities and Privileges) Order 1968 was an example and no new issues of principle arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A minor change which is incorporated in these orders is the replacement of references to purchase tax by references to car tax and value added tax. This has been made necessary by the Finance Act 1972. The orders also contain transitional provisions which are made necessary by the eventual replacement of the National Insurance Acts and the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts by the Social Security Act 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
In addition, the opportunity has been taken to revise the wording of the earlier orders to correspond with the terms of the 1968 Act. The old orders were made over a period of 20 years and contained many variations of drafting. The present orders supersede the earlier ones and will introduce much needed uniformity of wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, these orders do not involve any extension of the privileges and immunities which Her Majesty's Government are obliged to accord under international treaties. However, in three minor respects they will enable us to fulfil further obligations. The order relating to the specialised agencies of the United Nations will enable effect to be given to revised texts of the Annexes II and VII of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialised Agencies. This involves very minor extensions of privileges and immunities. Privileges and immunities will be accorded to representatives of associate members of the Food and Agricultural Organisation. I should explain that an associate member of FAO is a country, such as Sweden or Switzerland, which is not a member of the United Nations and can only be an associate member of the Food and Agriculture Organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assistant directors-general of the Food and Agriculture Organisation will be given "high officer" status. The same status will also be conferred upon assistant directors-general and regional directors of the World Health Organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order relating to the International Atomic Energy Agency will enable the United Kingdom to withdraw the reservations it made when accepting the Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the agency. This will mean that officials and experts who are citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies will be treated in the same way in the United Kingdom as other staff of the agency. However, it will not mean that high officers of United Kingdom nationality will be entitled to full diplomatic immunities since under the relevant rules of international law persons of United Kingdom nationality do not in any event enjoy full diplomatic immunities. It will also mean that an officer acting for a high officer during the latter's absence from duty can have high officer status on a temporary basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The order relating to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development confers very limited immunities and privileges upon judges of the tribunal established by the Convention on the Establishment of Security Control in the field of Nuclear Energy, and on representatives, counsel and advocates appearing before the tribunal. The obligation to accord these privileges has existed for over 10 years, but hon. Members will no doubt be relieved to learn that because the tribunal has never met in this country there has been no risk so far of Her Majesty's Government being in breach of their international obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the draft order relating to the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, which will also be made under the International Organisations Act 1968. All this order does is to give the Laboratory, which goes by the horrid name of "EMBLAB", the legal capacities of a body corporate. The purpose of the laboratory is to promote co-operation among European States in fundamental research in the development of instrumentation and in advanced teaching in molecular biology and related fields of research. Such research is particularly important in the search for the causes of cancer. The laboratory will concentrate its activities on work not normally or easily carried out in national institutions. The headquarters of the laboratory will be at Heidelberg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom signed the agreement on 10th May 1973 and ratified it on 11 th December 1973. The other signatories are the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Denmark, Italy, Israel, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Switzerland. So far five of the 10 signatories have ratified the agreement, which will come into effect when a majority of signatories had done so, and when contributions to the laboratory budget from States which have ratified the agreement represent at least 70 per cent. of the total contributions. The States which have ratified to date account for just over 53 per cent. of the total.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to you, Sir Myer, for agreeing that the orders should be taken all together. They raise no new questions of principle and I hope that the Committee will agree to their acceptance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>

	<p>4.37 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Kershaw</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister of State for his explanation, but there are one or two assurances which we should like from him. He made it fairly plain that there is no extension of activity of these bodies expected in the sense that a large number of extra personnel have to be considered. I understand that they will continue to act as they have in the past under administrative arrangements and that we are putting on a legislative footing what has hitherto been a somewhat 
	<i>ad hoc</i> arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know the degree of activity in this country of the various organisations which we are discussing this afternoon. I imagine that most of them are on a visiting basis rather than in permanent premises, but I should like to know how many of them are working here continuously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, may we know whether the other countries involved in the different organisations are extending the same facilities, greater facilities, or less? What is their position? I recall in the past that when international agencies were being set up we found that we were not much favoured by them, because of the stricter interpretation by the officers of Customs and Excise of the privileges that we were prepared to afford to the officers who were going to work in these international organisations. For instance, I believe that the life of an international civil servant in Brussels is a good deal easier than it would be in comparable installations here where we tend to insist on the letter and the exact carrying out of our laws, which are perhaps a little stricter and not quite so complacent in respect of international organisations as they are in Brussels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly we have some kind of an interest in having international organisations here. In fact, we have rather lost out on this. There are some cases in which we have made strong efforts to have international organisations in our country but we have not been successful in attracting them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the immunities and privileges that we are prepared to give have been a contributing factor or whether they are irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
If the right hon. Gentleman could satisfy us on those points which are perhaps minor points, I feel sure that the Committee will be very grateful for the explanations that he has given about the Orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.41 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for having missed the opening sentences of the Minister's explanation, which was admirable. My hon. Friend said that the order did not represent any extension of personnel. Could the right hon. Gentleman say what sort of numbers we are talking about in connection with the various international organisations established here?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend rightly said that it would be good for the country if these international organisations were in the United Kingdom, but sometimes problems are raised. I direct the Committee's attention to Article 17 of the draft instrument about privileges and immunities of persons belonging to these organisations. This may seem to be a trivial matter but it raises problems for the police and for good relations between Her Majesty's subjects here and the people belonging to these organisations who come from overseas, since they appear to enjoy immunity from any parking restrictions. What is the present position?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More seriously in these times of international terrorism; there was a case, of which hon. Members will be aware, when arms were brought in under the diplomatic immunity of the baggage of diplomats. To what extent are immunities enjoyed by such diplomats and to what extent is there a waiver of privileges or immunities at the present time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.43 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ennals</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been asked about immunities with regard to parking. Fortunately, this has not much affected representatives of international organisations. I have the relevant statistics. During the 12 months ending 31st March 1974, the number of fixed penalty notices in respect of illegal parking of motor vehicles which were cancelled on grounds of immunity were as follows: the Commonwealth Secretariat—which does not actually come under the heading of today's orders—75; the Commission of the European Communities, 17; the Intergovernmental Mari-
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
time Consultative Organisation, 36; Western European Union, 24; and the International Coffee Organisation, 75. As far as we are aware, no persons connected with international organisations claimed immunity from jurisdiction in respect of any other criminal or civil proceedings during this period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of customs and protection at airports; it is of course a British responsibility to ensure that diplomats or people purporting to be diplomats do not enter carrying weapons, or that they do not carry weapons at London Airport. That is an important issue at present and one on which there have been representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Kershaw) asked about the number of organisations in London. There are about 12 organisations with their headquarters or a subsidiary office in the United Kingdom which enjoy a limited degree of privileges and immunities, which are granted to enable the organisation to function efficiently and independently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation and the Commonwealth Secretariat, to which I referred, it does not include any of the major specialised agencies of the United Nations. That is partly because we have housing and accommodation problems. While it might have been attractive to have/ made offers at one, stage, the absence, for instance, of a Government conference centre produces difficulties as well for international organisations having headquarters in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may just touch on the subject of the officers of those organisations, high officers of the organisations to which I referred—10 in number—are given the status of diplomatic agents. They enjoy personal immunity and diplomatic privilege. The other members of these organizations—those who are not high officers—have immunity only in respect of their official acts. They have certain limited privileges, consisting mainly of exemption from United Kingdom income tax on their emoluments, which are subject to an internal tax for the benefit of the organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position of the Commonwealth Secretariat is slightly different as its members are equated by Act of Parliament to members of a diplomatic mission.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
There are 35 members of the Commonwealth Secretariat who have diplomatic status, with the appropriate privileges and immunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of the staff of international organisations, numbering 432, immunity is limited to their official acts only. They enjoy no privileges other than exemption from United Kingdom income tax on their emoluments, which are subject, as I said, to internal tax for the benefit of the organisation. Provided that they are not citizens of the United Kingdom or permanent residents, they are allowed Customs franchise on their furniture and personal effects imported at the time of their installation in this country, but not at a later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation, the senior members of its staff number 46 and they enjoy certain additional privileges provided that they are not citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies or permanently resident in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have dealt with the questions raised—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kershaw</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked the right hon. Gentleman whether he had any means of usefully comparing the sort of facilities that we put at the disposal of diplomats with those of other—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ennals</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forgive me for interrupting, Sir Myer, as I hope the hon. Gentleman will—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will give the right hon. Member diplomatic immunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ennals</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged. I should like that. It would relieve me of taxation burdens and I should hand it over to my own organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are international agreements laid down by each of the international organisations with which we are concerned. It is a responsibility upon each member State to provide those same immunities and privileges in each member State. It is perfectly true to say that some are more fastidious than others, and some are more generous than others. We are anxious not that we should be over-generous but that we should fulfil our
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
international obligations. That is the purpose of the orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
