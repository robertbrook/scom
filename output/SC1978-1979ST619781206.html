	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Sea Fish Industry Act 1970 (Relaxation of Time Limits) Order (1978.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if with this we were to take the following:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Fish Authority (Research and Development Grants) Order 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Fishing Vessels (Acquisition and Improvement) (Grants) (Variation) Scheme 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be the one and a half hour time limit on the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that it has been agreed that the Committee should consider these instruments together. The Sea Fish Industry Act 1970 (Relaxation of Time Limits) Order 1978 and the White Fish Authority (Research and Development Grants) Order 1978 complement one another. They provide for continued Exchequer assistance for the fishing industry and the funding of what are perhaps the most important activities of the White Fish Authority and Herring Industry Board. Although similar measures have been laid before the House in recent years a word about each may be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Fishing Vessels (Acquisition and Improvement) (Grants) (Variation) Scheme 1978 extends the current arrangements by a year, up to the end of 1979. These arrangements, which have remained substantially unchanged since 1967, provide for grants from Exchequer funds towards the cost of construction of new fishing vessels and the improvement of existing ones. Since March 1975 the rate of grant has been standardised at
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
25 per cent, of approved costs of all projects. We propose no change for the coming year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the Sea Fish Industry Act 1970 (Relaxation of Time Limits) Order 1978. Hon. Members will be aware that the Act provides for Exchequer funding of the borrowing requirements of the statutory bodies for the purpose of giving loans for acquiring, reconditioning or improving inshore fishing vessels and their gear and for fish processing and ice-making plants. Unless renewed before then, the enabling power will expire at the end of this year. The order before us today extends these powers for a further year. It also extends for a similar period powers whereby Ministers may contribute, by way of grant, towards the valuable research and experimental work undertaken by the statutory bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This leads me to the third order, the White Fish Authority (Research and Development Grants) Order 1978. It has only one substantive provision which I can explain very briefly. The intention of this provision is to raise the sum which can be made available from central funds to the White Fish Authority for its research and development work by £1 million. If the Committee approves the order, as I anticipate that it will, this will mean that the aggregate amount provided for the White Fish Authority since 1952 will total £6 million. The additional sum of £1 million would be made available to the authority for its research and development work to match the contribution which it makes from its levy on first hand sales of white fish in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2 of the order refers to the limit of £2 million imposed by the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1970. Section 23(2) of the Act provided for this sum to be increased if necessary by an amount not exceeding £1 million at any one time. Similar orders to that now before the Committee increased the limit of £2 million to £3 million in 1972, to £4 million in 1975, and £5 million in 1976. At the current rate of expenditure on research and development this £5 million will, in total, have been reached in 1979. The order would, on present calculations be sufficient to enable the Government to support the White Fish Authority's programme for a further two to three years if necessary. There can be no doubt that the authority's research and development
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0602">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
work is one of its more essential functions and much valued by the fishing industry. The Government's financial contribution to it is expected to total £508,000 in the current financial year 1978–79.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Fish Authority's research and development programmes are kept under continual review both by its own research and development policy advisory committee, on which the fishing industry is well represented, and also by the Fisheries Research and Development Board which was set up by fisheries Ministers in 1973 to ensure a proper balance in the objectives and priorities of all Government-aided fisheries research and development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The precise sum granted each year by the Government depends primarily on the fisheries department's approval of the programme and on the amount which the authority, in consultation with the industry, decides to devote from its levy income to research and development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two of these three instruments under consideration today have as their purpose the provision of assistance towards investment in new or improved vessels. Members of the Committee will be well aware that the terms to be negotiated for a common fisheries policy satisfactory to the interests of the United Kingdom will have an important bearing on the shape and the size of fleet which will be required for the future, and on future grants and loans provisions. It might be argued that, given present uncertainties, prudence would demand a stop on assistance for investment in vessels. However, past experience has shown that an arbitrary stop of that kind can cause real social and economic hardship, particularly where there are many self-employed people involved. Moreover, there would be an unfortunate impact on shipbuilding yards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice the fishing industry is showing no tendency to invest in a grossly expansionist fashion. New building has been at a relatively modest level in recent years, primarily to capitalise on opportunities available in inshore and near and middle waters. The statutory authorities are also required as part of the scheme before us today, to examine every grant application in terms of economic viability and in relation to the overall needs of the industry. At the moment, both authorities are restricting aid to modernisation and such construction as will replace vessels lost to
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
fishing for various reasons. There is therefore, little risk of imprudent investment being encouraged by this scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Expenditure under the scheme during the current financial year is expected to amount to about £6 million and the Government are making provision for comparable expenditure in 1979–80. Hon. Members will appreciate that such level of expenditure means that, despite the many uncertainties which exist, the industry's contribution towards its future efficiency is running at nearly £18 million per annum. Clearly, the availability of grant is an important investment consideration for the industry. However, until the future structural requirements become clearer we think it inappropriate to enter into any long-term contracts. For this reason we propose to continue recent practices and extent the arrangement for a single year only, that is until the end of 1979.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Minister for the explanation he has given this morning. In a short debate on technical matters such as this, it is helpful to have the explanation first. On behalf of the Opposition I should like to thank the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to put one or two points to the Minister about the instruments. First, in almost every case, these instruments affect the functions of either the White Fish Authority or the Herring Industry Board. This may be an appropriate moment to ask the Minister what the Government have in mind for the future of these two bodies. These bodies are now carrying out virtually parallel functions. Although one of them is much more closely related to the white fish industry and the other to the herring industry, ever since the two bodies moved into the same building in Edinburgh—and many of us then considered it sensible and prudent to have them there together—questions have been asked as to how long they will continue to be technically separate. We know that there is the utmost co-operation between them because so many of their functions are common.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, I appreciate that any change in the status of either of these two bodies requires legislation and cannot be done administratively. It might be helpful if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0603">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
the Minister could give us some indication this morning of what the Government have in mind regarding the future of these two bodies, particularly as separate parts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that many people believe that it is right to have a statutory body in the fishing industry because of the functions to be performed. Many of these functions are better performed at arm's length from Government. But it is sometimes questioned whether, in a modern fishing industry, there should be two separate bodies. I know that it has been argued that there should be a single fisheries authority, or something of that nature. Some clarification of the Government's thinking on that point would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns research and development. I, too, join the Minister in his tribute to the value of the work that is done. There is no doubt that it is extremely valuable. It is appreciated by the industry and a great deal of it is applied. But here again one is, as the Minister said, up against the uncertainty of the renegotiation of the common fisheries policy and the future of the industry as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that R and D specifically refers to the processing of fish. There is at present a great deal of uncertainty in the fish processing industry due to shortage of supplies, and so on. I would be interested to know what the processing industry is now doing on research and development. With that section of the industry in such uncertainty one wonders what is happening with the direct application of the work that is being done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third, I turn to the question of fishing vessel grants. I welcome the extension for another year of these grants. The Minister said that they have been taken up only modestly, which is probably correct compared with the way that they have been taken up in the past. It says an enormous amount for the confidence and faith of ordinary fishermen that they are taking up these grants at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I attended a launch a few weeks ago of a boat from Buckie, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Watt), with a skipper from my own constituency. This boat, costing many hundreds of thousands of pounds, is one of a pair, the other boat having been
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
launched earlier. The two boats will be working together. I could not help but reflect on the tremendous faith that those who are putting in the money for this boat—the fishermen and others who are on a share basis with them—have in the future of the industry. I hope that the faith of those who are using these grants is justified by the kind of agreement which the Government achieve through the common fisheries policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have three points to make in this respect. The first, is a point I made on a statutory instrutments Committee a few weeks ago. This measure deals specifically with grants to our own fishing vessels. Can the Minister say something today about the plea from the deep sea and middle distance fleet regarding interim assistance measures to help the structure of the industry until the common fisheries policy is renegotiated? That point is relevant to these measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not repeat the arguments because the Minister heard what I said a few weeks ago regarding the Liston fleet from Granton—part of the Boyd Line, which closed. I mentioned then that there are reports that Germany is using funds to finance interim measures to restructure the fleets. The Minister referred to the future size and shape of the fleet. Germany is using these interim measures to keep the fleet alive. We are worried that part of our fleet may be dying. Our real concern, after the common fisheries policy is renegotiated—let us hope that we get a fair and proper share of fish resources—is whether we shall be left with enough boats and a fleet structure sufficient to take advantage of what is left to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows, there is a very strong plea, particularly from middle distance and deep sea sections of the fleet, for some kind of interim measures of the kind that Germany is introducing, to keep the fleet alive until we know precisely what the outcome will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point in this respect is that in recent weeks many of us have been interested to read stories of a number of foreign vessels which are becoming reregistered and joining the British fishing fleet. This clearly has an effect on the future structure of the fleet. I would be surprised if the Minister has not considered this. While he can have no precise idea about what the future of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0604">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
fleet will be until the common fisheries policy is completed, there is this aspect to be borne in mind in continuing our own grants. Quite apart from the grants that we are giving to build new vessels, other vessels are coming in, re-registering under a British registration and joining our fleet. I have no idea of the scale on which this is happening. It would be useful if the Minister could give some indication, as it has direct relevance. If other vessels are joining the fleet from outside at the same time as we are giving money to build new vessels, this must be a factor to bear in mind. Perhaps the Minister could tell us what monitoring the Government have carried out of what is taking place, on what scale, and what relevance it has to these measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, it would be helpful if the Minister could clarify a point of detail. I understand that when foreign vessels join the fleet, it is a relatively simple process, taking about 30 minutes to complete in terms of documentation. I understand that, not only vessels, but whole crews are being brought in. The regulations are complied with so long as there is a British skipper on the vessel. Everybody else on the vessel can be foreign. Perhaps the Minister could comment on what influence he feels that this will have on the structure of the fleet in the interim period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are all the points I wish to make this morning. I believe that the latter ones regarding factors which have an influence on the size and shape of the fleet are highly relevant, when we are devoting public money to the building of new vessels. We know that there is uncertainty. We do not expect a definitive answer on all these points this morning. But these matters will have an effect on the fleet and it would be helpful to know how the Government see these things developing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.48 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Mudd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like closely to follow my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). It seems to be a travesty of the traditional use of flags of convenience to find that we now have foreign vessels proudly flying the Red Ensign. Indeed, to take it a little further, in Falmouth at the moment we are absolutely amazed to find an Irish vessel flying the British flag and with a Korean crew. We hope
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
that we shall not reach the situation in which we have a Korean vessel with an Irish crew, which of course poses a far more difficult and complex issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I welcome the measures that we are debating today because at the very least they will mean an upturn in activity in many of our boat-building yards. That is certainly important and very welcome. I would ask the Minister, with his right hon. and hon. Friends at the Department of Industry and the Department of Transport, to look at two problems encountered by boat-builders in Cornwall, who can certainly turn out first-class vessels and first-class hulls. The problem is that, although we can turn out the good vessels, we find that the development area status that we have in Cornwall means that we cannot compete with the special and favourable terms being granted by the Scottish Development Agency and the Highlands and Islands Development Board. We are, therefore at an economic disadvantage in Cornwall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second problem arises with the Department of Transport. Having built first-class hulls, we now find it virtually-impossible to get them to Scotland to be fitted out in Scottish yards. One cannot put a fibreglass hull of 40 feet overall length into the sea and hope that it will arrive in the middle of Montrose or Leith or somewhere like that. We therefore hope that the Ministry of Agriculture will get together with the Department of Transport to make it more simple and less time-consuming to carry these all-important hulls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is aware—and perhaps he could mention it to the Minister—of the case of one hull which is coming from his constituency to my constituency. There is a transport problem with a yard, which will run out of work within the next 14 days and men will become unemployed, unless the necessary licence is given for this hull to be moved by road from Penryn to Montrose. Perhaps the Minister could take note of that point. Since it has considerable relevance to men's livelihoods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mudd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to learn of the problems in my hon. Friend's constituency. Our problem is exactly the same. The boatyard wants to get cracking on another hull but it cannot until this one
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0605">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
leaves. Therefore, employment at my end is threatened as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point to the Minister is that, as he is well aware, in Cornwall we are very concerned about the massive increase in the capacity for mackerel fishing. I hope that we may receive his assurance that there will be close surveillance under these measures to ensure that a disproportionate investment is not made in conversions of existing vessels so that they may go in further pursuit of the poor old Cornish mackerel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.52 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friends the Members for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and Falmouth and Camborne (Mr. Mudd) I welcome these measures. I do not think that we need to spend very much time discussing the relaxation of time limits. But I should like briefly to mention the research and development grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing these measures against a very difficult background. For instance, I read in the papers yesterday that fishermen were contemplating mounting a blockade of the oil terminals at the Firth of Forth, in Scapa Flow and in Shetland because they were so worried about the lack of progress being made in the renegotiation of the common fisheries policy. If we reach agreement, as I hope we do within weeks or months, I wonder whether there may be some need for a crash programme of research, particularly to back up any claims that we may make for the introduction of non-discriminatory conservation measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When discussing an order last week, I talked about the possibility of our getting a development grant for industrial fishing for blue whiting in the Atlantic. On the other hand, one of the things that fishermen in my own constituency say repeatedly is that, with the amount of fishing being carried out in the North Sea, and because of its importance in the production of fish for human consumption, there should be no industrial fishing in the North Sea at all. Do we have enough scientific data to substantiate any claims for conservation which we put in in the interests of our area of the North Sea? Is it necessary to spend more money than we would otherwise have envisaged spending?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Another point that arose during last week's Committee was the dispute which we are still having with the EEC as to whether the stock of herring in the Clyde is a separate stock and can be treated separately from the stock of herring in the Minches and the North Sea or the Atlantic. That is the sort of issue about which we should be quite certain that we have no lack of scientific data and modern scientific research. If we fail to substantiate these conservation measures which we may put forward we can no doubt be taken to the courts in Europe and that would result in a very unsatisfactory position for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the grants and loans. There is one point on which I should like clarification from the Minister, if not today, then in future. I understand that, although it is not contained in these measures, it is the policy of the White Fish Authority not to give grants and loans for vessels which are replacements for those under 10 years of age. Agafn there is an anomaly, because if somebody with a boat less than 10 years old seeks to buy a new boat, he could get the old vessel out of the British fishing industry by selling it, say, to New Zealand, Australia or the West Indies, or he could sell it to somebody for reconditioning, to make it into a pleasure yacht as opposed to a fishing vessel. He would then be able to get his grant and loan even though the vessel that was being replaced was 10 years old or less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I have spoken to forward-looking skippers, many have told me that a chap who is on the go and seeking the improvement of his fishing—someone who wants to keep up with the changes—needs to replace his boat after about five to seven years with something which is newer, more up to date, possibly with heavier engines or whatever. I hope that the Minister may be able to give us some reassurance about that. As I understand matters, this is not in the measure we are discussing, it is simply in the administrative capability of the White Fish Authority and the Herring Industry Board. I also ask the Minister to tell us something about the number of vessels which, if they cannot get grants and loans through the White Fish Authority, can, as I understand matters, receive assistance by way of loans through the merchant shipping

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
legislation. How much use is made of that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also been approached by fishermen in my part of the world about their belief that better terms are being offered in Norway than by the White Fish Authority. It is said that in Norway one can obtain a loan towards 80 per cent, of the total cost of a vessel at 7 per cent, to 8 per cent, interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is another matter which I wish to put to the Minister. This is something which has come up at different times. As we try to conserve one species we put pressure on another. Are we happy about vessels of the size reported in the 
	<i>Fishing News</i> of this week? The report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A 225 ft. purse seiner—the biggest ever ordered by a British owner—will be delivered from Norway next January."</p></blockquote>
In the past we have had trouble with the development of certain types of fishing and we have had to say that we believe these developments are endangering the stock and, therefore, we must prohibit them. The Fishing News of this week also reports:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Signs that the Humber is set for a big investment in new boats".</p></blockquote>
In other words, because we see the end of the Humber deep water fleet, there is a likelihood that the owners will have to turn to building boats and come into competition with the existing inshore fleet. Are we happy that we will have the right structure in the industry? Should not some measure now be taken to prevent the dangers inherent in the event of a failure to reach agreement over the common fishery policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. I shall try to answer some of the points which have been made. Having dealt with such measures for a number of years, and anticipating that I may have the privilege of continuing to do so for some years. I am constantly repeating myself. I believe that much, of the future shape of the industry will be determined only when we have the outcome of the common fisheries policy. I have already paid tribute to the forbearance of the industry and the cautious way in which it has carried out its necessary maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
In my opening speech I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Hon. Members will appreciate that such level of expenditure means that, despite the many uncertainties which exist, the industry's own contribution towards its future efficiency is running at nearly £18 million per annum."</p></blockquote>
This ties up with what was said by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and shows a cautious optimism in the future. But we shall not get the answers until the uncertainties of the common fisheries policy have been removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with some of the points made by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns. He paid a powerful tribute to the work of the WFA and the HIB. As he said, the future of those bodies is under review. I refer the hon. Member to the Government's response to the Fifth Report of the Expenditure Committee, presented to Parliament on 3rd November this year. This said that the Government welcomed the support given by the committee to the role played by the White Fish Authority and the Herring Industry Board in assessing the fishing industry, but that, as a review of the two bodies was in progress, the Government believed that indefinite deferment of a decision on the future of the two bodies could be damaging to the morale of their staffs and to the industry's confidence in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member said, the function and the future of the authorities are currently under review by Ministers. The initial consultations have been held with the representative bodies in the industry, and those associated with it and with, of course, the statutory bodies themselves. No sensible conclusions can be reached until the future needs of the industry are much clearer than they are at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the entry of foreign-owned fishing vessels to the United Kingdom register, we keep this under review. We are satisfied that the registration of foreign vessels is on a small scale and has a small influence at present on the structure of the fleet. There is no evidence to date of incursions on a large scale. We shall do what we can to make sure that our interest is preserved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking up the point made by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns about the re-structuring of the fishing industry, he will be aware that the EEC
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0607">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
has tabled proposals to assist re-structuring. These, of course, are not necessarily calculated to be those best suited to the need of our own industry. Each country has to judge them from its national point of view and the needs of its industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government fully recognise that a degree of structural change will be necessary to enable our United Kingdom fishing industry to take full advantage of the changed opportunities which will be available in the future. That is why my right hon. Friend has already asked officials of the fisheries department, in conjunction with the White Fish Authority, to consider the possibilities of structural change. This work is now under way. The need for any consequential alteration of existing arrangements, and the views of the industry, will be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns spoke of the Liston fleet at Granton. There is a comparison to be made with the help given by our EEC partners. It is true that several of our partners operate a wide variety of aids. This is no reason why we should automatically follow suit. It depends on the local needs and the situation. Aid must be tailored to match these. The aids given by our partners are for the most part structural —scrapping and laying-up subsidies. Little has been done to keep unprofitable vessels at sea, save that the French give a fuel subsidy, and support is available for experimental voyages and for switching to lesser known species.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Germans have considered it appropriate to assist the mackerel fishing industry, but it will be recognised, especially by the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Mr. Mudd), who has contributed today, that while the Germans consider it appropriate to assist the mackerel fishing industry, this activity is highly profitable for the majority of United Kingdom vessels engaged in it. The point I am making is that it is difficult to make valid comparisons between the help given by the various countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What really matters is the overall help which is given. I am not sure how others compare with the resources provided by the White Fish Authority and the HIB and the substantial contribution made by our own fisheries department. It is the totality of the help and whether the help is really given and whether it is made-to-
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
measure for the problems that the industry faces that matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns spoke of herring processors. We know that most of the processors in Scotland are in receipt of temporary employment subsidy. This has been of great value in keeping many firms in existence. The major processors began receiving TES in October 1977. The hon. Gentleman knows about the future in relation to TES. I have been questioned on this matter on previous occasions. There is another debate tomorrow, on Norway pout, and hon. Members may have another bite at the cherry—or its equivalent in fishing terms. I can give an assurance that the officials of DAFS, together with those at the Scottish Economic Planning Department who administer selective financial assistance to industry in Scotland on behalf of the Secretary of State, are looking urgently at the various ways in which processors might be helped, and at alternative forms of assistance that might be employed by the Government. We are well aware of the problems being faced by the herring industry as a result of conservation measures which we have been compelled to introduce and which the industry accepts. The majority of firms are already being helped through the temporary employment subsidy and the Government are looking into the longer-term prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne. He spoke of the need for close surveillance of conversion. I should point out that the White Fish Authority keeps factors such as this in view and assures itself that each grant proposition is viable in the context of all the factors. He also mentioned fibreglass hulls. This subject has been raised before and we shall certainly keep it in mind. It might be helpful if I write to the hon. Gentleman about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) mentioned purse seiners and other vessels distorting the future structure. Here again, the WFA and the HIB keep this point very much in mind when approving grants and loans. For instance, HIB approves no purse seiners. The purse seiner in question was built without grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to another point raised by the hon. Member for Falmouth and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0608">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Camborne, the South-West has, of course, been very prominent in recent months with its concern about over-fishing of mackerel. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the careful assessments that we have made of the fishing opportunities in the area. He will know also about trans-shipment and so on. We have certainly been concerned about the situation in Falmouth Bay, with its pollution and other problems. We are in touch with Ministers in other Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject of over-fishing is of great importance, when regulating United Kingdom fishing for mackerel. Foremost in our minds is the need to avoid overfishing. Fortunately, we do have a thorough and carefully-considered assessment of the stock available—from ICES, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. As hon. Members know, this is an international scientific body in which United Kingdom scientists play a part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been various assessments made over a period. Last year, the total international catch reported to ICES was 315,000 tonnes, which was nearly 40 per cent, less than in each of the previous two years. There have been big increases in United Kingdom catches, but there was a bigger reduction in foreign catches —notably by Eastern bloc countries. The latest TAC for this year may sound large compared with previous recommendations, but it is still smaller than the total international catch reported in 1975–76. The fishermen of the South-West have, understandably, been concerned to see so much increased effort there, but it is important to remember that the catch is much less than before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trans-shipment is a valuable export effort and is counted as part of the quota for that period by the fishermen. It is not, therefore, in excess of the quota. We are very careful to make sure that there are safeguards there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the blockade of oil terminals has been raised. I very much hope that the fishing industry will maintain its highly responsible approach and attitude to the reappraisal of the CFP. The blockading of oil terminals will not help us to obtain any satisfactory settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
That leads me to the current state of negotiations. We are all anxious to see these negotiations terminated satisfactorily as soon as possible. As my right hon. Friend said in the House last week, the Fisheries Council met on 23rd and 24th November to discuss the new document from the Commission, which demonstrates more flexible attitude on its part. Unfortunately, no substantive progress was made at that meeting of the Council. These matters are now under discussion by the Heads of Governments in Brussels and I cannot speculate on the outcome of the discussions. However, I can confirm that it remains our objective to arrive at an acceptable agreement on the CFP. Given goodwill and realism from all concerned, that will still be achieved. I know that I have no need to repeat our objectives. Like hon. Members, I have been reading some of the assessments of the future in the fishing press. Our objectives are well known, and we hope that an early settlement can be arrived at which will give more confidence to the industry in the future. I am sure that in the meantime the instruments before the Committee this morning will play their part in improving the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
