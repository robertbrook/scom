	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Finsberg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Clause should not give rise to too many difficulties. The one continuing theme which has run through all our discussions is the lack of information. Hon. Members have been worried whether they knew the figures involved, and they have questioned some of the statistics provided by the Marie Stopes Institute and by the Simon Trust. Those of us who accepted the figures provided by those organisations did so sincerely, and those who said that the figures were necessarily selective equally believed that this was so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, irrespective of the views of hon. Members upon the Bill as such, I do not think that there is any dispute that it would be useful to have figures and that the statistics which the new Clause calls for will be of use both to hon. Members who believe in the principles of the Bill and to those like my hon. Friends the Members for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) and Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison) who disagree with them. The wide spread of names supporting the Amendment shows that there is no dispute about that. I am grateful that hon. Members with completely differing views on the principles of the Bill have put their names to the new Clause. I believe that the sponsor is not unhappy about the principle of the new Clause and also that the Minister will not oppose it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sole purpose of the new Clause is to provide figures which will be of use to the Department when it undertakes the wider integration of vasectomy in the recasting of the National Health Service. The figures will provide information for the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead) if he decides to campaign further on this principle, and will enable my hon. Friends to judge whether the Bill when it becomes law was misconceived, and will enable them to take a strong stand if and when the Government decide to incorporate vasectomy into the wider integration of the National Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons I commend the new Clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Mr. Michael Alison)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene briefly at this stage because it may be to the advantage of the Committee for me to indicate the Government's view of this widely sup-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
ported new Clause. We recommend to the Committee that they should accept the new Clause, which seems to be eminently reasonable, may provide some useful information, and, by specifying the matter of age records, will, perhaps, go some way towards strengthening our hand in the guidance which we may specify for local authorities at a later stage. I therefore suggest that the Committee could with advantage accept the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Phillip Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also intervene briefly to thank the Under-Secretary of State for what he has just said and for his kindness and co-operation throughout our proceedings. The hon. Member for Hampstead (Mr. Geoffrey Finsberg) is right in thinking that I accept the new Clause unreservedly. A proposer of a Bill occasionally falls out with his fellow sponsors, but on this occasion I am delighted to see the wide range of support for the new Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was clear in our proceedings last week that the view of the majority of the Committee was that an age limit should not be embodied in the Statutes but should be dealt with by a circular. It was established that there was considerable dispute about the number of people under the age of 30 who wished to have the vasectomy operation. There is a clear difference in experience between the Simon Trust and the Marie Stopes Clinic, as is shown by the figures which have been supplied. It will be extremely useful for detailed figures of the categories of persons involved to be kept by the local authorities on an annual basis. Only on that basis shall we be able to see how the legislation works out and whether any amendment will need to be made later. Hon. Members should not lightly overlook the difficulty we have as legislators when faced with medical matters, and I say this with the example of the Abortion Act before us. The new Clause will be an extremely useful Amendment to the Bill and I hope that the Committee will unanimously accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the last new Clause standing on the Paper although there may be new Clauses and Amendments on Report. It is agreeable that the new Clause should find support on both sides of the Committee, and I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
Barkston Ash (Mr. Alison) has signified the approval of his Department for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We who have been opposed to the principle of the Bill have always stressed that this is an important matter not to be lightly taken, as I fear some hon. Members have taken it, and it is desirable that the fullest knowledge should be made available to the Secretary of State and to the House. In proceedings of the Committee we have often referred to the information made available to us by the Simon Trust, but this is not the final word on the subject. It is desirable to have as much information as possible about the working of the Bill when it becomes law. The hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead) referred to the Abortion Act. The working of that Act has been very different from what was intended by its sponsors. Many people have been deeply concerned about this and have changed their views since the Act came into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is every reason for adding the new Clause to the Bill, but in this atmosphere of harmony I add that my opposition to the principle of the Bill is in no way weakened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will have been noted that my hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison) and I have been as co-operative and helpful as possible to the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead), as we have been throughout the proceedings on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that I questioned your Ruling, Mr. Fitch, which, of course, was absolutely right. That I did so as I did was because I was late into the Committee and so in a bit of a flap. I hope you will accept my apology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted when by hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead (Mr. Geoffrey Finsberg) did me the honour of asking me to include my name among those in support of the new Clause. I accept whole-heartedly the new Clause apart from one or two small matters which worry me slightly. It gives some little check to a Bill whose checks were wrecked at an earlier stage, although we are still hoping that on Report some of those checks will be put back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) of the new Clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A report shall be made each year by every local health authority to the Secretary of State showing how many patients have received treatment in accordance with the provisions of this Act and categorising such patients by age."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
This information will enable us to see what the doctors are doing. The hon. Lady the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) will know what I am trying to get at when I say that there are two ways in which this operation can be performed. One way may have the hopeful possibility of the operation being reversible; the other way means that almost certainly the operation is irreversible at any stage. I am only citing what I have read in a distinguished journal written by doctors. Whether the operation is or is not reversible depends on the way in which it is performed. I hope that the addition of the new Clause will also enable the Department to get information on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Finsberg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been making inquiries on this subject. As far as I understand it, experiments have taken place in America with certain satisfactory results. It is possible to use what the Americans call in a shorthand form the tap technique. It is still a very expensive operation. I understand that at the moment it is costing about £250 per patient because some of the material used is gold. Experiments are now being undertaken to see whether plastic can be used, and I gather that some work is being done in Britain at the moment on this particular technique, so it is already a possibility. I go along with my hon. Friend in hoping it may be possible for the Department at some stage to issue some guidance or advice on what has been done to give more widespread knowledge on whether it is possible to carry out this operation in such a way as to give people opportunity in certain very closely defined medical circumstances to have it reversed at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is kind to help me out on this sad subject—the last thing one would choose to debate on St. David's day. I suppose it is fitting, as we are indulging in an exercise of helping people to mutilate themselves rather than simply allowing self-mutilation, that we should have bits of plastic in ourselves here and there. [
	<i>Laughter.</i>] Of course everybody knows there are operations—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Sinclair</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are on leeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leo Abse</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Leeks are not plastic. They are genuine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member and extend a welcome to him this morning, especially as he has come in in such splendid style on this great feast day of St. David. I hope you will be generous to me in this slight aside, Mr. Fitch, for the feast day of St. David is a time for rejoicing, as are other feast days in our islands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir G. Sinclair</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: St. George's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Particularly, of course, St. George's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a good enough historian of sex to know just what view St. David would have had on what we are doing this morning, but I would have thought that on the whole he would have supported the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think my generosity has now come to an end. Will the hon. Member get back to the new Clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Fitch, of course I fully accept that Ruling, but we are discussing a Clause which, as far as I can see, is designed to help the future of the Bill, and—otherwise I would not have appended my name to it—to make the Bill a little less dangerous and a little less irksome, and a little more acceptable to people who would walk in the steps of St. David, than it now is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intervention of my hon. Friend only highlighted the immensity of the job to be done by the Secretary of State and his advisers, and, indeed, by medical research on this operation. It is clear from what my hon. Friend said that if he is right we should not be even thinking of this Bill at this stage with the lack of knowledge of the vasectomy operation. I say that only in passing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that in ten years' time, when I shall not have much more to do with these things, I suppose, the state of knowledge may make it safer, from the technical point of view, for doctors of all sorts in all parts of the country to perform this operation. It may then be easier for the Ministry, because then they will have had ten years of the operation of the Act, more readily to carry out the suggestion in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second subsection of the new Clause says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of every local health authority to keep a record for the first two years of operation of this Act showing how
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
many patients under the age of thirty years applied for but were refused treatment under the provisions of this Act."</p></blockquote>
I hope my hon. Friend will not feel he has been cheated if, when such records are kept, they are kept not just for people under 30, because there is no magic in the age of 30 any more, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) having been responsible for altering the Bill in such a way that age no longer applies. The age of 30 was just pulled out of the heavens as a guess. I am hoping that he will in no way be averse to records being kept of applicants and patients of all ages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of every local authority …"</p></blockquote>
The trouble is that we know that the Health Service is to be transformed in 1974 and we do not know whether the local health services will be in a position to carry out this duty. I know I am being a bit incomprehensible but it is because I am trying to tread a careful way in order to remain in the chairman's good books this morning for a change. I am querying with the Minister what is going to happen to the Bill and what he will do about it. All we have from him is that in 1974 the whole of the Health Service is being transformed and this proposal will then lapse and come under the new umbrella. I do not know why he said this, but if it is so, the terms of the new Clause are of enormous interest to him. He is going to have to do certain things and burdens will be put on his shoulders. I cannot say anything more at this stage without getting out of order. I sit down with a feeling that we have got no further in spite of the enormous willingness, assiduity, help and kindliness of the Minister in his interventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>tee would wish to join me in thanking you, Mr. Fitch, for the kindly and expeditious way in which you have presided over our proceedings.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Is the hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. Perhaps one should take some blame to oneself for not shouting loud enough. Nevertheless, the noise from my hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order. I shouted, Mr. Fitch, as you called the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead). I thought I was in error in shouting so insistently because I thought the hon. Member wished to speak on the Question of reporting the Bill, which you have now told us is not debatable.

Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison), who wondered why I was on my feet at that stage of the proceedings, I may say that I was addressing my remarks to the Chair in strict accordance with precedent. If the hon. Gentleman will look at the Report of the Committee proceedings on the parent Act he will see that Mr. Edwin Brooks addressed his thanks to the Chair. In that I am accompanied by, and indeed echoed by, those who at best can be deemed to have uttered some caveats to the whole question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that you are almost as new to the Panel of Chairmen as I am to the introduction of Bills. Perhaps it was said to you that presiding over our proceedings was a very easy matter. I went the other day to a dinner at the Royal Society of Medicine where four papers on vasectomy were read, and they were introduced by the Chairman of that distinguished society who said that vasectomy was a minor operation which used to be considered simple. The same thing might be said of the chairing of Committees. This ought to have been a minor operation. It would, perhaps, in theory, have been considered simple. I think we all agree that you have presided over us extremely well, and I should like to thank not only you, but also the Under-Secretary of State and all those Members of the Committee who have turned up faithfully week after week throughout our proceedings, and have helped—sometimes, like the hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Fitch, I must assure the hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead) that I did not interrupt him because I thought
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
him to be out of order. Not at all. But I thought we should have had a Division, and we wished to have a Division.

11.0 a.m.

I am indeed most grateful to you, Mr. Fitch, for having allowed us to record our Vote against the reporting of this Bill to the House. Of course, I can concede to almost anyone in the House superior knowledge of procedure—witness the slight failure of my opening stratagem; but I do not think that has really affected the progress of this Bill very much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have risen, Mr. Fitch, merely in order to echo the compliments of the hon. Gentleman to you. I believe that this is the first time that you have presided over a Standing Committee. All I can say is that no one would have thought so, and the courtesy with which you have treated the minority in this Committee, and, indeed, all Members in this Committee, is something for which we are most grateful. We are also grateful, of course, for the consideration and the help given by the Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Barkston Ash (Mr. Alison).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) and I appreciate the attitude of those who disagree with us. We do not like this Bill. We have tried to do our duty as Members of Parliament, and we shall return to this matter when the Bill is reported to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank the two hon. Members for their kind remarks, and the Committee for being so helpful. As both hon. Members have said, this is my first experience as Chairman of a Committee, and I can say that it has been a very worthwhile experience indeed. Thank you.

The Committee rose at one minute past Eleven o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
