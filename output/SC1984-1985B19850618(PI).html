	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston upon Hull, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to move the motion because I have great concern, as do my hon. Friends, about the future of the merchant shipping industry and the people who work in it. Since the Government came to power in 1979, the neglect of the industry has been remarkable. The decline has been accentuated beyond all reasonable expectations since the Government came to power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Particularly as a result of last year's Budget, the industry, which has its back to the wall, is having to carry higher costs arising from taxation policies. The Government reduced the tax benefits of seamen and airline staff, which has put pressure on their employers to compensate for that loss of income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry is in a serious plight. It has declined and there has been a dramatic drop in the number of people employed. In addition, it is having enormous difficulty in coping with foreign competition—foreign flags and other countries, especially in south-east Asia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tonnage has dropped by 50 per cent and the number of vessels have fallen by just under 50 per cent since 1979. At the beginning of this period, there were 1,200 United Kingdom-owned and registered merchant ships. These comprised about 36 million tonnes deadweight. However, by the end of 1984 there were fewer than 700 ships, which amounted to 18 million tonnes deadweight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That shows the seriousness of the decline in the industry, yet the Government fiddle while Rome burns. It is appalling that that has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments have been tabled by hon. Members, and the Government have also attempted to do something to arrest the decline. That was demonstrated in the Minister's comments on the proposals for reducing the write-off period for second-hand ships. Although it would be unreasonable not to welcome that attempt it
	<span class='label label-info column'>588</span>
does not seem to be part of a coherent strategy. On one hand the Government seem to be saying, "Let us encourage owners to take on more merchant vessels by reducing the capital cost," but on the other, through their taxation policies, they are increasing the current revenue cost. So there seems to be no strategy at all; the Government are simply sitting back and watching the decline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our interesting debate on reducing the write-off period for the second-hand vessels, the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) tried to justify the proposal in a strategic sense. He did not define the meaning of "strategic sense", but I presume that it includes the military aspect such as another Falklands war. Those who are far more knowledgeable about the merchant fleet than I am have said that we could not sustain another Falklands war as we did because of the decline that has taken place in our merchant fleet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a previous sitting we had a discussion surrounding subsidy. During their period in office of almost six years, the Government have created the impression that "subsidy" is a dirty word. I do not believe that it is. Sensibly placed subsidies can be of immense value. The more one looks at foreign industry and foreign competition, the more one realises that nowadays subsidy is an essential tool in ensuring that our industries can compete fairly. Our merchant fleet cannot do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pattern of taxation on employees in the industry shows that in 1974 a resident of the United Kingdom who worked abroad for 365 days or more could claim tax relief on 100 per cent of his earnings and if he worked fewer than 365 days abroad he could claim tax relief on 25 per cent of those earnings. In 1977, the system changed and tax relief was given on 25 per cent of the earnings if a person spent 30 days or more abroad. Last year, that tax relief was reduced to 12½ per cent of earnings and, as from April 1985, all such benefits disappear altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in the industry, like all of us, have commitments, such as mortgage repayments. The Government have made a foul swipe at their earnings. Seamen on low earnings have lost £4, £5 or £6 from their pay-packets and the masters of tankers have had as much as £20, £25 or £35 a week docked from their wages. That loss is serious and unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequences of those tax changes should be examined in the context of the biggest group of workers—merchant seamen. On the 1984 figures they stood to loose an average of £10 a week each on earnings of about £158 for a 68-hour week. Such losses are not only bad for the workers. They are bad for employers as well. Employees' incomes have been reduced almost at a stroke over a two-year period, yet they have long-term commitments such as mortgages. Who can blame them for putting pressure on their union for wage increases above those generally accepted by the Government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1985, pay increases have averaged 8.2 per cent to 8.6 per cent although the industry has its back to the wall. Such increases are above the rate of inflation, though only just, if the earlier part of the year is taken into account and weighted a little. There is no need to say more about their effect on competitiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has happened is unfair and has aroused tremendous bitterness in the industry which I cannot stress strongly enough. In the beginning, many people in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0849">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>589</span>
industry thought that anti-avoidance procedures would not affect seamen and airline staff. Both sides of the House support anti-avoidance measures. No one supports the fiddlers of the system. Unfortunately those who work in the industry and who live abroad have to pay tourist prices. They bear the extra costs associated with living abroad but they are not always in this country to use the services here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to return briefly to the employees' reaction, and I shall quote from the NUS journal, The Seaman, dated April-May 1985. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) is the only Member of Parliament sponsored by the NUS. I assure all hon. Members that feeling on the issue is strong. Page 2 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was accused by the NUS of 'knocking more nails into the coffin of the British merchant navy by his failure to use the Budget early in March to announce new Government policies to rescue the fleet'. The absence of any major direct measures to help the shipping industry would hasten the decline of the fleet, which had slumped from 1,200 to under 700 ships during six years of Conservative rule, said General Secretary Jim Slater."</p></blockquote>
I notice that the Financial Secretary is here today—
because the article went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Meanwhile the Chancellor's deputy—Treasury Secretary, John Moore— has turned down a request from Slater for an urgent meeting to discuss the ending of the overseas tax relief. The General Secretary said—seamen were bitterly angry and disappointed that the Chancellor had not restored the 25 per cent tax relief given to employees spending more than 30 nights abroad each year."</p></blockquote>
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel particularly pleased that we have the opportunity to discuss the issue today. The National Union of Seamen clearly has not had the opportunity fully to make its case. I am glad that all hon. Members, particularly Opposition Members, will be able to comment on some of those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the anger and resentment about the 25 per cent rate not being restored, there has been intense pressure to claw back some of the money that was lost. Last year, as a result of the first phase of the Chancellor's proposals, seamen had a 3 per cent cut in pay and are having a 4 per cent cut this year. That is why there has been an attempt to claw back a wage increase which is about 4 per cent above the rate of inflation. That was done with the owners' backs against the wall and because of the Government's neglect of the fleet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Income tax relief for seafarers seems to be a reasonable way of making the fleet competitive. We are talking about a small amount of money, approximately £12 million to the Exchequer. Conservative members may say that that seems a lot. However, it does not seem a lot when compared with the amount of money that the Committee approved about three sittings ago when we abolished the land development grant which amounts to £50 million per annum. If any hon. Member questions that, the 
	<i>Official Report</i> will confirm it. Last week we had a debate about giving tax relief on exchanges dealing in futures and other commodities. There was a certain amount of money to the Exchequer: we were not given the figure because it was not known. Nevertheless we seem to be forced to subsidise that industry. I remember the Minister's words clearly: he said that we had to make our exchanges competitive with those of Japan and all the other countries. We are asking the
	<span class='label label-info column'>590</span>
Minister, in principle, to do exactly the same here so that our merchant fleet can compete with other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Which are these other countries? They already give the type of tax concessions that I have described. Denmark does, as do Greece, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. Why do we have to be so different? Three of those countries are members of the EEC. The Government seem to be undermining our fleet in the context of European trade as well as that of international trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last summer, I visited some of the shipyards in Taiwan. I saw the intent of the Taiwanese Government to build up the world's largest container fleet. The shipyards I saw were not making money. I asked one director whether he was making a profit and he replied, "Certainly not, but we shall have the biggest fleet at the end of the day". That is their objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These tax matters need to be viewed in that context. If we cannot compete with such countries, which have many other advantages, we are in trouble. Taiwan, Japan, Greece, Finland, the Netherlands and Norway are all doing what we are asking for today, yet during the reign of the Tory Government our fleet has declined and we have lost about 30,000 jobs. That shows the seriousness of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even the EEC seems to support the Opposition's view on this. A memorandum on merchant shipping, dated December 1974, was adopted by the European Commission. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission would regard a favourable tax regime for Community seafarers as a reasonable way of helping to maintain employment of EEC nationals on Community ships."</p></blockquote>
So we have no problems with the EEC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was fallacious of the Government to muddle the position of seamen with that of business men who embark on overseas trips for tax avoidance purposes. Such purposes are to be condemned. The Opposition are trying to provide a reasonable standard of living for seamen while doing something to help the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a feeling of great bitterness in the industry. About 2,000 letters from the National Union of Seamen have been received by hon. Members. I have received some of the letters, presumably because I represent the port of Hull, although most of them have been sent to Conservative Members. The letters contain a list of ships, which I would like to put on the record, but it is rather long. It includes the QE2, the Dragon, the Geestbay, the Stena Normandica, the Maersk Retriever, the Uganda, the Keren, the Australia Star, the Viking Valiant, the Viking Venturer, the Earl Granville, the Aulica, the ACT 1, the Appleleaf, the British Fidelity, the British Progress, the British Renown, the British Skill, the British Tweed, the Canadian Explorer the Isomeria, the Orchid B, the Pacific Teal, the Matco Thames, the British Resolution, the Stena Ionia.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was not that the full list?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was. It slipped out. As I read it, I thought that it showed the power of feeling about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a debate last year on the subject, there was talk of the Falklands. We can be patriotic and talk about our seamen. We used them for the Falklands. Then the Government kicked them in the teeth by robbing their pay packets and preventing their having a reasonable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0850">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>591</span>
standard of living, and forcing them to crush their employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will agree to this very sensible and reasonable new clause and help to revive the British merchant fleet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has spoken very ably on behalf of the sadly declining number of his constituents who are engaged in merchant shipping. I declare some interest in the subject. The port of Manchester was once one of the largest in the country. It has been decimated—not only, I admit, but partly, as a result of Government policy—so that now almost no shipping comes into Manchester. There still exists, however, a legacy of Mancunians working in merchant shipping who are awaiting any words of comfort that the Financial Secretary may have for them. They hope he will tell them that he will restore the position to what it was prior to last year's Budget. This is a matter of great anxiety to those in the merchant shipping industry and also to those in the airline industry. In yesterday's debate on the Floor of the House, those who work in the airlines in Manchester were done a great disservice as a result of the Government's policy of promoting one region at the expense of the rest of the nation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) says, "Nonsense." I appreciate that he has to defend the interests of his constituents—in the richest region of the country. It is right and proper that he should do so. However, my hon. Friends and I take great offence when an hon. Member who has throughout our proceedings represented the narrow factional interests of one profession while Opposition Members represent the broad mass of the people in British society, intervenes from a sedentary position. If the hon. Gentleman would engage in debates from a broader base, and look to the interests of merchant seamen and their families and not only those of his former colleagues, we should listen to him with greater respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A disservice was done to merchant seamen by the dramatic and large-scale change in last year's Budget. If we were to accept the pure theory of market clearing prices on which the Government operate, it would be obvious that to make a sudden change, increasing taxation by up to one third in reducing the allowance by a quarter, would have a serious impact upon those in the industry. It must make it easier for foreign shipping companies to attract labour from such cheap labour sources as the Philippines which have increasingly over recent years come to dominate shipping. That would be done at the expense of the jobs in the merchant shipping industry currently and historically occupied by the constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), by my own constituents and by the constituents of many other hon. Members of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dramatic nature of the change seriously disadvantaged the families of those in merchant shipping, as wage rates were based upon the tax system in operation up until last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West has told us that the rate of wage increases has been marginally higher than the rate of inflation. But that has not compensated for last year's change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>592</span>
As a result those engaged in shipping and in the airlines have been greatly disadvantaged as the wage rates were originally under the old taxation structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise what a difference the change has made to the families of merchant seamen. The wife of one of my constituents, whose husband is serving in the merchant shipping fleet, wrote to me recently asking me to do all that I can to ensure that the changes are restored in this year's Finance Bill. Like many of those directly involved in the industry, she knows the arguments, because she experiences their effects directly and not in an abstract way. It affects her pocket as she tries to run a household and to bring up a family while faced with a real cut in income. As she pointed out, the expense of someone involved in the shipping industry and those of his family are larger than those of someone in an ordinary occupation. Every day that her husband serves abroad, she still has to pay the rent and feed the children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: She does not have to feed him, does she?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is an expert on many such matters. No doubt he is ready to tell us, with the help of his brief from the Association of Chartered Accountants, about the feeding costs of taking one person out of a family. But if the hon. Gentleman had ever cooked for a family, even for his own, as I frequently do—perhaps he does as well—he would realise that very little money is saved when the cost of one person's food is taken out of the family budget. To suggest that there is a massive saving is arrant nonsense. It does not remotely approach what my constituent's husband has to spend when he is ashore in some foreign port, having to find accommodation and look after his own meals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield, being an expert, assures us that that is nothing. Perhaps he would like to tell the Committee about seafarers' accommodation. Coming from a well-known seafaring constituency, he must have a detailed knowledge of the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My father knew about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is living proof that the hereditary principle is not worthy of much recommendation. While I grant that his father may have known about the shipping industry, it was not transmitted down the line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is lucky to have had a father at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in the fortunate position of being as able as most people to prove the existence of my father. I can do so quite easily because of our close relationship. I can even demonstrate the legitimacy of that relationship, which might not be so easy for the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that the expenses of seafaring families are greater than those of ordinary families, and that it is simply not equitable to treat them on the same basis. It was recognised 10 years ago when these concessions were introduced that added expenses were incurred not only by those working overseas—for example, in the export trade—but by those temporarily or indeed permanently absent and involved in the two industries that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0851">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>593</span>
we are dealing with. The Government debated the matter last year in the context of the Royal Navy. No doubt the Financial Secretary now wishes to update the allowance offered to those in the Navy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. John Moore)</div> <!-- member -->

	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apparently he does not. But the principle is well established and accepted that compensation should be given to those in the Royal Navy. Not one of my hon. Friends would dissent from that. We accept the parallel with the Merchant Marine service. It is up to the taxation system to treat those in the Merchant Marine service fairly. I strongly support the case put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West—not because my hon. Friends and I want a particular perk given back to a particular group, but because the change made last year caused massively increased costs and hardship for the families of seafarers. It would be equitable for the taxation system to recognise that injustice and take account of the valuable conribution made by seafarers by restoring what has been taken away from them and their families.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Hodge Hill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) for his initiative in tabling the new clause. Unlike my hon. Friend—and my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd)—I cannot claim a direct constituency interest. That is not surprising, because my constituency is near the geographical centre of England. Nevertheless, it should not be surprising that I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relief on overseas earnings was increased by the Labour Government in 1974, so it is natural that we should regret and oppose the decision announced last year by the Conservative Government to abolish that relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a long-standing relief on the overseas earnings of seamen. Ten years ago, it was increased; last year it was abolished. I say "abolished" because it is a two-stage process, and it is therefore appropriate for us to debate the matter again this year. We opposed the Government's measure last year to reduce the relief by half—from 25.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent; this year, the relief will be totally abolished, being reduced from 12.5 per cent to nil, as a result of last year's Finance Act. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West that we should oppose that and pledge ourselvs to do something about it when we return to office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West said that seamen earn on average £158 for a 68-hour week, and that the measures announced by the Government a year ago mean that they will lose, on average, £10 a week. That is a substantial reduction in net take-home pay. As my hon. Friend said, it is not surprising that seamen have been pressing for wage increases to compensate for that loss. Through trade union negotiations, they have obtained an increase which last year was greater than the rate of inflation, but it has not compensated them for the loss they suffered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that seaman feel especially aggrieved. I have not received letters from any of my constituents,

although I know that seamen have written to many Members of Parliament and have been supported not only by Labour Members but by some Conservative Members. It will be interesting to see whether we receive any support this afternoon when we press the new clause to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seamen are particularly aggrieved at the Government's other measure—no doubt, we shall debate it at a later stage—to tax their assessed amounts of tips. I understand that in some cases the Inland Revenue is assessing seamen as having received £2,000 a year in tips or gratuities. Seamen on many liners, particularly the QE2, feel greatly aggrieved about what has happened in a space of only 18 months. On the one hand, they lose tax relief on overseas earnings; on the other hand, they are attacked by the Inland Revenue, which is assessing them for tax on tips which often they have not received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tips and wages are connected. As a result of these two measures, more and more shipowners are employing people of other nationalities as seamen on board their ships, and in some cases I understand that owners are moving towards a system of remuneration which depends on tips. In other words, they are not only employing foreigners, but they do not pay them wages, telling them to depend on the tips or gratuities that they get. It is an appalling development, for which the Government are largely to blame.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I base by case also on international comparisons. As my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West said, several EEC countries treat seamen on a special basis, and the EC Commission published a memorandum within the past six months suggesting that the EEC would look favourably on special tax regimes for seamen to encourage the employment of EEC nationals on ships registered in the EEC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the power of the argument advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford that when a seaman is abroad the family expenses continue at broadly the same level as when he is working in this country. Moreover, when seamen are abroad—I am talking about people who are abroad for more than 30 days in the year—they cannot use the facilities that are paid for in this country by the taxes levied on their earnings abroad.,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In times of war—indeed, only three years ago in the Falklands war—the Government were not ashamed to turn to merchant seamen, especially those of the QE2, for their active support, at the risk of their own lives, in what the Government considered to be the interests of this country. I commend the new clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the strong constituency interests and the legitimate continuing interests of the hon. Members for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) and for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) who bring knowledge of this industry to our debates. I also acknowledge another hon. Gentleman, the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), who was with us in committee in spirit last year. He has had a consistent and continuous supportive interest in the industry, and I know that hon. Members would like me to remind the Committee of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West asked about legitimate representations. As he rightly said, I wrote to the NUS general secretary, Mr. Slater,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0852">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>595</span>
some while ago. Since then the hon. Member for Kingdom upon Hull, East has continued to seek meetings, debates and discussions. In my last letter to him of 13 June I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Unfortunately there is little I can add to my letter of 20 May.</p></blockquote>
As you say, we agreed at our last meeting that my officials at the Inland Revenue would discuss with the unions the effects of the withdrawal of the 25 per cent foreign earnings deduction. These matters and proposals for new reliefs were the subjects of the meeting I referred to in my last letter.
	<br><blockquote><p>I will of course look carefully at any new ideas or fresh facts which you may wish to provide on the taxation of seafarers, and it may be that the best way forward would be to meet again once we have some further information of this sort. But of course, should you wish to come to discuss these matters at any time, I would be happy to see you."</p></blockquote>
I know that the hon. Gentleman has been an assiduous, ardent pursuer of seafarers' interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have seen that letter and discussed the contents with my hon. Friend. There seems to be some confusion about whether the Financial Secretary is willing to meet my hon. Friend only if there are some fresh facts or information. The Financial Secretary seems to be going much further than that and saying that he has an open door, as I know that he has to all hon. Members. Will he state that he is willing to see my hon. Friend at any time to discuss this matter? One of the fresh facts could be the depth of grievance and ill feeling amongst seamen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me be quite clear about this. As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) said, it would be inappropriate for Government Ministers not to give opportunities for discussion to Members of Parliament, for legitimate reasons of diary difficulties and others. In addition, the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) is an Opposition shadow spokesman, so it would obviously be inappropriate if I did not offer to see him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I always think that meetings are more beneficial when based on facts, information, and obviously an advanced assessment of an appropriate subject for debate. However, within reason, I am always content to see an Opposition spokesman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must take the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West gently to task for another point. I had to write down what he said, as I could not quite believe it. I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stern) is with us, as he will remember last year's debate. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West said earlier that it was a fallacy for the Government to muddle the position of seafarers with that of overseas business men. He attended the Committee assiduously last year, so I hope that he will reread—as I did before this sitting—the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West, who put the history of the issue on record quite remarkably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Gentleman will want to be reminded of the problem that confronted his right honourable Friend the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Healey) when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. When facing the absurd taxation structure that he and his Socialist attitudes created and trying to ameliorate that nonsense, the right honourable Gentleman tried to target and identify the problem of "the sharp end" of exporting. Happily for those seafarers, they came in
	<span class='label label-info column'>596</span>
on the back of that pattern of reliefs. I shall refer to the 1974 pre-history shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems of Socialist attitudes to taxation is that reliefs that they sought to target not only failed to target and created problems but also created the present legitimate difficulties for a decent body of men who became used to having their employers' payment of wages subvented through the taxation system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister refers us to the 1976— 77 era. Did the then Conservative Opposition oppose those concessions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman was not present in our debates last year and I did not want to bore him with the detailed quotations that I and my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West made then. I quoted my right honourable Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who said that one could not disagree with reliefs that sought to mitigate somewhat the absurd levels of penal Socialist taxation, but he warned the Committee of the product that would flow from such nonsense. The Chancellor put that on the record, and I quoted it last year. He made it clear that any rational Government, and probably previous Socialist Governments, regarded such reliefs with distaste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I would remind the Committee of the past history. I hesitate to quote Moore on Moore, but I refer to the proceedings of the Finance Committee last year, when I reminded the Committee that
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is much misunderstanding about the history of the reliefs before 1974—a subject about which I should like to remind the Committee. It has been suggested that we are proposing to take away a special tax privilege that seamen have enjoyed for many years. That is simply not the case. Hon. Members who have studied the subject will know that before 1974 employees performing all the duties—I stress "all"—of an employment outside the United Kingdom paid United Kingdom tax only on the part of their earnings that they remitted to this country.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>That rule applied to everybody, and a few seafarers benefited, especially those ratings engaged on casual contracts for foreign-foreign voyages. However, most seafarers—those engaged on permanent engagements with United Kingdom lines—did not benefit from the remittance basis.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Although the law changed in 1974, it was still only a minority of seafarers who could benefit from the 25 per cent deduction that replaced the remittance basis for earnings from employments performed wholly outside the United Kingdom. The 25 per cent deduction was not a special measure for seafarers, it just so happened that some seafarers, along with other shore-based employees, benefited.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In 1977, the then Labour Government changed the rules again, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West said, to benefit those at the sharp end of exporting who had not qualified for the remittance basis or for the 25 per cent deduction under the 1974 law.—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A</i>, 17 May 1984; c. 399-400.]</p></blockquote>
It is as well to remind hon. Members of the history of that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the clause is plain. It seeks to restore for some people the 25 per cent foreign earnings deduction withdrawn in last year's Finance Act. First and foremost it aims to restore the deduction to two classes of people—seafarers and airline employees—who would then have the opportunity to benefit in a special way under the income tax system. But the clause is drafted in terms that will not achieve that apparent purpose, and I shall explain why in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year in Committee, we had a lengthy debate on the subject of the withdrawal of the 25 per cent foreign earnings deduction. That was when clause 30 of the Finance (No. 2) Bill 1984 was being considered. Throughout the passage of that Bill, I was fully aware
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0853">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>597</span>
of the strength of feeling on that subject among seafarers and aircrew. As well as receiving and replying to about 2,000 letters and telegrams from those who had been benefiting from the relief, I met their representatives to discuss with them their concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hodge Hill asked a few moments ago about the relative strength of feelings since. Of course feeling continues. I accept that. However, it may be useful to put it on the record that since the mid part of 1984 I have, as Financial Secretary, received about 200 letters on that issue, almost all from seafarers or hon. Members representing seafarers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will know that in the 1984 debate I explained the history of the 25 per cent foreign earnings relief. I pointed out that the relief and its justification lay in the Labour Government's attempt to mitigate the worst effects of the extremely high marginal rates of tax which no longer have a place in our income tax system. Of course, we have made further progress this year with our policy of lowering the burden of personal income tax generally, reducing tax rates and increasing thresholds. This year there is a real increase in personal allowances for the fourth year in succession; and the real value of the married man's allowance is at its highest level since the war. The reasons I gave in the 1984 Committee debates for withdrawing the 25 per cent foreign earnings relief are as valid today as they were a year ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister give the figure of total taxation on, for example, the wage of an average seaman with a wife and two children? Obviously, I do not expect him to do so here and now. However, can he confirm that, taking all forms of taxation, both direct and indirect, into account, that group would have seen a reduction in taxation? If that is not the case, his argument that the reason why the Conservative Members supported the introduction in the late 1970s of what they would now consider an anomaly, is undermined. It would be consistent for them, if seamen faced higher levels of taxation now than at the time it was introduced, to say that because they supported it in the 1970s they must now insist upon its reintroduction, because under the Government seamen are disadvantaged not only through higher rates of taxation but through the removal of the anomaly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the data here, and I shall certainly send a copy to all members of the Committee giving the precise position as it affects the typical married rating and different grades to try to show the relative impact of the changes in relief withdrawal on a 12.5 per cent and 12.5 per cent basis combined with the interaction on that of the increased personal allowances. I would not for one moment pretend that the increased allowances did more than mitigate the otherwise difficult impact on seamen of the withdrawal of relief. Nobody pretended last year or pretends now that the withdrawal of any relief does not hurt and does not cost in tax terms. It was the quantum, and I shall certainly put that in a letter to the hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have always gratefully acknowledged the contribution of seafarers and airline crew to our economic performance. The merchant navy's role in peace and war, which has legitimately been raised by the hon. Members for Hodge Hill and for Kingston upon Hull,
	<span class='label label-info column'>598</span>
West, is one for which this Government—and, I am sure, all Governments—have always had immense admiration. However, as I explained last year, the now withdrawn 25 per cent foreign earnings deduction was introduced in 1977 in an attempt to offset the penal rates of taxation by encouraging those at the sharp end of exporting, to use the words of the right honourable Member for Leeds, East. It would belabour last year's debate to discuss some of the bizarre features of that theoretical attempt to tailor the relief to exporting. However, it seemed unfair at that time to deny relief to those actually carrying goods abroad, while providing it to the exporters concerned. Reliefs were extended to seafarers and aircrew to provide parity of treatment with exporters, and no other reasons were advanced at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause seeks to restore the 25 per cent foreign earnings deduction to those to whom it was extended in 1977 solely on grounds of parity with those for whom it was originally intended. It would be impossible to justify either in logic or on grounds of equity to seek to restore a relief for exporters, for whom it was originally intended. That is not argued in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the new clause had appeal and merit in principle, I should trouble hon. Members more about its drafting. However, as hon. Members are concerend about this issue, it may be useful if I draw their attention to the more fundamental than technical drafting problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ironically, the framing of the clause seems to deny relief to those very seamen and airline crew that it is presumably designed to help—those who help the country's export drive. I shall explain a little of the background to show why this is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One problem with the affairs of seamen and aircrew is the need for tax purposes to ascribe a location to the performance of their duties. Section 184(3)
	<i>(b)</i> of the Taxes Act 1970 deals with this. It treats as performed in the United Kingdom voyages or journeys that touch a United Kingdom port.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause lacks any such provision, so that only journeys from one foreign port to another would trigger relief. That would scarcely assist the export performance of the United Kingdom. For the technical reasons I have described, very few seafarers and aircrew would be eligible for the relief that the clause seeks to introduce. I venture to suggest that those who qualified would not necessarily be those for whom the relief was intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real issue is not how few or how many people. would benefit. Rather, it is that a special relief in the form of a foreign earnings deduction is sought for a special group of people. I said last year that the whole concept of the 25 per cent foreign earnings relief was nonsensical. I cannot accept that there is a case for singling out any two particular groups from all those who travel and work abroad as beneficiaries of a relief that will be partial and unfair to a broad body of taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West touched on our Merchant Marine. In view of his interests, he did so legitimately. I remind him what I said on clause 55, which involved capital allowances. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West fairly said that the Government had gone some way towards trying to help the industry in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talked about the decline of our Merchant Marine, which we all regret. But the decline
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0854">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>599</span>
of the merchant fleet during the past ten years must be put in proper perspective. It is a question not only of the recession and of too many ships chasing too little businesses. Changed patterns of trade must be taken into account, especially—this is crucial—on North Sea oil and the development of containerisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A significant part of the reduction of numbers of ships relates to oil tankers. Fifty five per cent of the tonnage lost during the past decade has been tanker tonnage. As the hon. Gentleman knows, one container ship will do the work previously done by several vessels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However the industry's future is not as gloomy as hon. Members make out. The latest note from 
	<i> Lloyd's List </i> on Friday 10 May talks of United Kingdom flag shipping beginning to emerge from the slump. That is a happy quotation to end on. It starts:
	<br><blockquote><p>"British flag shipping continues to emerge more favourably from the long-running shipping slump than many of its overseas competitors, latest General Council of British Shipping figures show."</p></blockquote>
The article continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"indicating that the UK industry appears to be heading out of the tanker and dry cargo slump more propitiously than many other flag nations."</p></blockquote>
We all wish our Merchant Marine and our seafarers well, but we do not believe that they should have a disbenefit under the taxation system that their fellow citizens would not seek. I hope that my hon. Friends will resist the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall comment briefly on some of the points raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) strengthen the argument about the difficulties for families arising from the cuts in the tax allowance. He clearly has experience with such problems, and I was deeply interested in what he said. It is a convincing argument that those in the ships and on the docks keep putting to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear what my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) said about the way in which the Inland Revenue has made a £2,000 assessment for tips. I have talked to many of those on the ships and I know that they do not earn anything like £2,000 a year in tips. This is yet another vicious attack by the Government on merchant seamen. Those on the tour liners are certainly receiving rough treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary spoke of the discussions that he has held with the general secretary of the NUS, and I am glad to hear that the Minister has moved a little. He has said that he is willing to meet my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Pre-scott) and representatives of the NUS without any preconditions. I was pleased to hear that the Minister's door is open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary said that I had muddled the position of seafarers and other businessmen and that the seamen had originally come in on the back of a provison intended as an incentive scheme for exporters. But that was not what I intended; the main tenor of my argument was that we must do something to prevent the decline of our merchant fleet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not listed those who will benefit from such a scheme or those who have lost out from the changes we have been discussing. There are people who work
	<span class='label label-info column'>600</span>
overseas, for example those in the Diplomatic Corps and other civil servants, who are exempted from tax by the Income Tax Act 1970. I do not know how much time they spend overseas. Is it fewer than 365 days a year? I have not analysed the figures, but I suspect that there is some inequity. I do not want to rake up the overseas allowances of Royal Navy personnel, but we must consider such matters in assessing the equity argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must help our merchant fleet to grow. Although the Financial Secretary ended on an optimistic note, I cannot accept that we can be very optimistic when we measure the decline which has been phenomenal. There has been a 50 per cent drop in the number of vessels, and almost the same in tonnage. The problem is very serious, and the Opposition are trying to help the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister commented on what I said about capital allowances, but it is not a strategy that will lift the industry out of the doldrums and the mess it is in. The decline has been marked, and the new clause is intended to make a contribution to our merchant fleet, to make it strong enough to offer fair competition to other countries and, at the same time, to ensure that merchant seamen will not have to press their employers for wage increases above the rate of inflation at a time when the industry faces so many problems. I hope that the Committee will accept a new clause designed to perform the important task of improving the wellbeing of our merchant fleet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause is concerned with the parliamentary control of extra-statutory concessions. Hon. Members who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0855">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>601</span>
were not here to enjoy our debate on clause 11 of last year's Bill in Committee, or indeed the debate on Report, may not know what extra-statutory concessions are. I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for providing an excellent definition in his explanatory notes. For the benefit of hon. Members who are unaware of this fascinating area of the tax code, I shall read the opening sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"An extra-statutory tax concession is a relaxation which gives the taxpayer a reduction in tax liability to which he is not entitled under the strict letter of the law."</p></blockquote>
Before speaking in support of the new clause, I should like to pay tribute to the Financial Secretary—it does not often come from this side of the Committee—and his officials, and also to his right honourable Friend the Minister of State. I think I speak for all members of the Committee in congratulating the right honourable Gentleman on his elevation to the dizzy heights of the Privy Council. I also thank officials in Customs and Excise for the courtesy with which they have handled the matter over the past 12 months. They have answered more than 500 parliamentary Questions for me, and have shown great patience and dedication—although, without meaning to be uncharitable or discourteous, I feel that it should not have been necessary to ask so many parliamentary Questions. The information should have been available to hon. Members without having to be teased out in such a laborious and cumbersome manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Financial Secretary and the Minister of State have been extremely helpful when pressed by questions throughout the past year. In the past few months, the Financial Secretary has conducted a review in the Treasury of extra-statutory concessions—how they are applied, how long they have existed, how much they cost the Treasury in tax revenue forgone and how many times each one is exercised during the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That review has finished, and in a parliamentary written answer on 16 May, the Financial Secretary said that he would put into the Library a full and up-to-date list of all extra-statutory concessions affecting both the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise, an explanatory memorandum, and press releases issued that day. The press releases, the explanatory memorandum and the VAT leaflet are in the Library. The Inland Revenue booklet, IR1, is still not there. I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would tell us when that leaflet will be in the Library and what will happen next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike last year, we have the facts at last and we have that definition of the concession. The facts make strange reading. There are 170 Inland Revenue extra-statutory concessions, and 39 Customs and Excise concessions. That is a total of 209. The important question that should tax hon. Members on both sides of the Committee and the public is how much gross revenue is forgone by the Treasury because of those concessions. It is extremely difficult to establish that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Economic Secretary give an estimate of that figure today? I suspect that he will not be able to do so because the answers to my detailed questions about each of the concessions have been very varied. Some have been, "Not possible to quantify", some, "Nil", some, "Minimal" and some have been as little as, "£50,000 maximum in any one year", such as that for VAT on linked goods schemes. Some have been "Up
	<span class='label label-info column'>602</span>
to £100,000 a year", such as double taxation relief on alimony. Many are as high as, "Not more than £500,000 in any one year."
The Financial Secretary has been very specific on some. For instance, there is the £10 million a year concession on meal vouchers, the £1 million a year on capital gains tax exemptions for matrimonial homes for separate couples, the £2 million a year Inland Revenue concession on the capital gains tax liabilities of people treated as resident in the United Kingdom before arrival and after departure during the financial year in which the capital gains tax falls due.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a wide range of concessions that are not quantifiable or not known, and which are in a range band or very specific to the year. I confess that I stopped adding after I had received the answers to the first 150, but, taking the lowest and highest points of a range band and adding those finite figures given by the Revenue, the range is between £44 million and £78 million of tax revenue in a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have now been told that there are 209 concessions—almost 25 per cent more than I was aware of when I made my calculations. I stand to be corrected by the Economic Secretary, but I suspect that the tax revenue forgone at the discretion of Inland Revenue commissioners and Customs and Excise officials is between £50 million and £100 million a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be grateful if the Economic Secretary can enlighten us and be more exact on those figures, but on my calculations that is the range involved. It is a great deal of tax revenue, and it should be a matter of serious concern to both the Government and all right hon. and honourable Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also been trying to find out from the Government how many times in any year any concession is invoked and when that concession was first introduced. It was just as difficult to get answers to that as it was to get finite answers about the amount of revenue that was forgone. Some of the concessions appear to have been invoked only once, twice or in single figures in any year; others—for instance, meal vouchers—were invoked hundreds of thousands, possibly even millions, of times a year. Some were introduced during the past year—I think 25 or 27 new Inland Revenue concessions were introduced in the past year; others are 30, 40, 50, 60—or even more—years old. So there is a wide range of cost, usage and well established tradition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those factors should lead any fair-minded person to say, "This is not satisfactory." Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will be in favour of flexibility in the implementation of tax legislation. Of course, most of the concessions probably will not cause offence to anyone. Opposition Members are in favour of flexibility and some form of discretion and do not baulk at any one concession, but we believe that it is undesirable and against the traditions of the House that so much tax revenue should be effectively lost to the Treasury without the House of Commons having any control over that lost revenue. Indeed, until this past year, many hon. Members were not even aware that so much revenue was being lost. Members of this Committee cannot be happy about that. Surely the House of Commons should decide on spending tax allowances—that is what concessions are—in the range of £50 million to £100 million in any year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0856">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>603</span>
So the new clause asks the Committee to agree to an annual motion to list concessions of large amounts— anything over £100,000 in any financial year—and more established concessions, which are those that have had more than five years' use. It is a modest and moderate request. It accepts that some concessions may arise only in a particular year and may immediately go out of use. We do not want to bother the House with those, or with concessions of minimal or nil cost. But in the case of concessions that involve hundreds of thousands or even millions of pounds in a financial year, and those that have been in use for more than five years, there is an overwhelming case for the Government to put them to the House in a motion, so that right hon. and honourable Members may know what money is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the Minister will have answers to all this. May I anticipate one or two of those answers? On Report last year, the Chief Secretary said in reply:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The basis for them is … statutory in that both the Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise are charged statutorily with the care and administration of their taxes, and from that statutory power their authority for putting forward these extra statutory concessions is thought to derive." —[
	<i>Official Report</i>, 11 July 1984; Vol. 63, c. 1171.]</p></blockquote>
The Chief Secretary was not too sure where the statutory power for those discretions came from. The Treasury has had a year in which to enlighten him, so that I hope the Economic Secretary will now tell us where the statutory power comes from. The Chief Secretary did not know last year. After a year, the Economic Secretary should know what the statutory authority is. The Chief Secretary said that he thought it went back 70, 80 or even 90 years. In my view, hon. Members should know the statutory power for these concessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory note which the Financial Secretary attached to his press release gives some indication of the Government's thinking. He says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is not easy to find legislative space"</p></blockquote>
for extra-statutory concessions. But that is true of every piece of legislation. It is always the wrong time; it is always too difficult; whichever party is in power, there is always too much legislation going through. What we now have to decide is whether the fact that between £50 million and £100 million in revenue is being lost every year is important enough to put before the House, and whether it is desirable and constitutionally correct for the matter to be decided by the House rather than be left at the discretion of Ministers or Inland Revenue or Customs and Excise officers. The difficulty of finding legislative space is not an adequate reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary says that "Treasury Ministers are consulted" about concessions. We are delighted to know that; it is very reassuring; but they do not tell us. Only in the last year of the campaign that has had to be waged has the House been better informed about the money that it has—unbenownst to itself—been spending. It is not enough, although it is better than nothing, for Treasury Ministers to be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary goes on to say that the matter is
	<br><blockquote><p>"the subject of annual reports by the Chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue and the Board of Customs and Excise."</p></blockquote>
You know as well as I do, Mr. Leadbitter, that members of this Committee seldom read anything but those reports. They are bedside reading for all of us, and we
	<span class='label label-info column'>604</span>
can quote chapter and verse. We know those wonderful documents back to front. But—even if we do read them—it is not enough for us to be told by two eminent chairmen what the concessions are, which is all that the report effectively does. Under the new clause, the House would approve the better-established concessions by affirmative vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary says in the explanatory memorandum that those two gentlemen are regularly scrutinised by the Public Accounts Committee. I should like to know when they last appeared before the PAC, and how much time was spent in questioning them on extra-statutory concessions. I suspect that the answer to the second question is no time at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that none of the reasons for not legislating and for not requiring parliamentary approval of those concessions disputes the desirability of such approval, although they all mitigate the Government's refusal to seek it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary says that extra-statutory concessions are reviewed twice a year by Treasury officials and Ministers
	<br><blockquote><p>"to allow consideration of them as candidates for legislation."</p></blockquote>
That, in my view, is the most revealing part of the explanatory memorandum. How is it, when those concessions are reviewed twice a year, that we now have 209 of them none of which is part of statutory legislation? The Financial Secretary has admitted by implication that they are perfectly eligible, that they ought to be part of legislation and that hon. Members should, on a non-partisan basis, support a new clause that will bring them into the legislative body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is a ray of hope. According to the final paragraph, the memorandum is
	<br><blockquote><p> "the Government's first response to the debate in the House."</p></blockquote>
Will their second response be to accept the new clause with good grace or even—as I hope—with enthusiasm? If not, when will they legislate on extra-statutory concessions, and what will their second response be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My I briefly congratulate the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) for his work on this matter over the past year? I believe that it is largely, if not exclusively, due to his efforts that we now have a full published list of the extra-statutory concessions made by the Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise, which is a very worthwhile achievement. How can we assess whether they are justified if we do not know what they are?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some ways, the new clause goes beyond the procedure for statutory concessions. We do not approve existing statutory concessions every year. Once one is made it goes on the statute book, and we leave it at that. However, I am keen to see more parliamentary accountability in this field and should be interested to know how many times the chairmen of the two boards have appeared before the Public Accounts Committee to answer questions on extra-statutory concessions. I am sure that the theory is right, though I suspect that the practice is different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously one has some sympathy with the Treasury on this matter, as there are practical difficulties. Many of the extra statutory concessions are transitional—they relate to a change in a tax which affects only two or three tax years. There is a list of provisions relating to estate duty which are now presumably obsolete. Every
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0857">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>605</span>
estate duty which are now presumably obsolete. Every year the Treasury starts with a Finance Bill even larger than the existing one, and we complain about the length of that. It tries to remove clauses proposed by the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise, with a view to improving the quality of legislation, so that the Bill is manageable in parliamentary terms, which is understandable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the problems arise from our ludicrous timetable for considering tax legislation. As the Budget does not come till March, and the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 requires a Finance Bill on the statute book within a definite period to enable the Government to collect taxes, we always have this undesirable rushed consideration of the Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, a technical Finance Bill has been suggested to deal with some anomalies that we all know should be dealt with in legislation. Apart from the anomalies that have already been conceded by the Inland Revenue, which are already subject to concessions, those who deal with taxation believe that it would be helpful to include others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Inland Revenue has sympathy in some cases. Perhaps the amount of revenue at stake should determine whether legislation is political or technical, as a proposal that is technical could easily become political. It could change character following an argument about it in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my right honourable and learned Friend the Foreign Secretary was shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, he spoke favourably about the prospects for a technical Finance Bill, but it subsequently disappeared into the mist. I think that I understand why. Ministers find it enough to deal with one Bill a year, as the timetable is a continuous one. As soon as we have dealt with this Finance Bill, the Inland Revenue will start to consider the contents of the next one, so it would be difficult to fit in a technical Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is important to meet the point raised by the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central about how to provide more parliamentary accountability in this area. We should have some way of approving these concessions. I believe that we should have a technical Finance Bill to include all these concessions in legislative form, so that we can consider them at more leisure. I do not know whether there would be the same enthusiasm to join a Committee on that as to join this one. However, it would be an important and worthwhile job for some of the more diligent Back Benchers on both sides of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without necesarily supporting the details of the new clause, I have considerable sympathy with the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Fatchett
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I join the congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher)? I did not serve on last year's Committee, and have not shared my hon. Friend's preoccupation—[Hon. Members: "Obsession"]—and therefore found his speech helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that "obsession" is the wrong word to use about my hon. Friend. It needs someone of this intellectual capacity to carry out the work that he has, and I congratulate him on his research. It was very useful for the Committee to be made aware of the sums of money involved, the extent of extra-statutory concessions and the limited degree of parliamentary accountability. My
	<span class='label label-info column'>606</span>
hon. Friend's research has been useful, and points in one direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In moving his new clause, my hon. Friend was particularly successful in building up a consensus in the Committee. We may have failed over the past few weeks to draw together the broad rainbow of a coalition, but I can see in my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, a potential leader of the coalition, or perhaps its leader as I cannot see him as the follower of others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this amendment we are drawing together a broad spectrum of opinion, and I am looking for a number of contributions from hon. Members on the Conservative Benches in support of the new clause. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) has already led us in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that the new clause is not appropriately drafted and needs improvement. My hon. Friend is a moderate man, and I know that he would be prepared to withdraw his motion if he could get from the Minister a commitment to introduce, at a later stage, a clause to achieve his aspirations and those, I suspect, of many Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to persuade Conservative Members to contribute, as I know that some members of the Committee are anxious about the time scale, but this is a crucial issue which should attract widespread support from both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to endorse the new clause because, with the sums of money and the extra-statutory concessions involved, it is essential that we look for ways in which Parliament can scrutinise the concessions and make Ministers accountable. That is one of our crucial functions as Back Benchers, and it would be a dereliction of duty if we did not seek ways to carry that function through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central made two particularly interesting points. First, he pointed out that Ministers are consulted by both the Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise. He also said that twice a year Ministers look for ways of including these extra-statutory concessions in the legislative programme, but so far nothing has been forthcoming. I take it that my hon. Friend's research was accurate on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield said that many of the concessions may be technical in that they overlap with other provisions and that may be the reason for their exclusion. However, if they are excluded so regularly, it may be for reasons that are not technical. Also, if Ministers are consulted, on what criteria do they decide whether they support the actions of the Inland Revenue and the Customs, or do they disagree with them? How do Ministers decide whether to support one concession for legislative action in the future and not others?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's new clause may not achieve its objective, but Parliament should know how the Minister makes his decision. Can he set out in some detail the rules by which he and his colleagues take these decisions? My hon. Friend is trying to open up discussion and make it possible to get accountability and the roles of the Committee and the House of Commons on to the agenda. If the new clause is not perfect, I hope that its purpose will find support on both sides of the Committee and that we can look for a means whereby
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0858">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>607</span>
accountability for concessions becomes the rule rather than the exception.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Opposition Front Bench I, too, pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) for the campaign that he has waged in the past 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the subject came to my hon. Friend's attention during last year's Finance Bill, I have watched with admiration the way in which he has waged his campaign, week in, week out. Indeed, at times I began to think that "extra-statutory concessions" would be linked with the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central in the same way that "Belgrano" is linked with the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell). My hon. Friend's campaign has borne fruit during the past few months; it may be significant that the fruit appeared as we began to consider the present Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share entirely my hon. Friend's scepticism and suspicion of extra-statutory concessions. Indeed, I go a little further than my hon. Friend. We start from an objection to extra-statutory concessions. We view them with suspicion because they go against the wishes of the House, which it has expressed in a statute. Any such decisions should be debated and justified in the House, at least in retrospect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our other ground for objection has been the secrecy that has shrouded extra-statutory concessions over the years. They have been given in a hole-in-the-corner way. It has been impossible for some people who wish to benefit from some concessions to find out about them as they have been known only to members of some trade association, or group. It is difficult for anyone who is not in the magic circle to know whether he could benefit from an extra-statutory concession from which others, in identical circumstances, have benefited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause takes my hon. Friend's campaign a step further, because it requires the approval of the House of Commons on an annual basis for those extra-statutory concessions if they are of a certain significance. He suggests a minimum of £100,000 as the threshold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) suggested that that was going much further than the House would usually go. He pointed out that we approve a statutory concession once and for all and wondered why we should approve an extra-statutory concession on an annual basis. But there is a difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government want to avoid debating extra-statutory concessions every year, they should put them into a Bill and they will then become statutory concessions and, if the House gives its approval, we shall all be happy. We object to discretionary decisions that on the surface flout the decisions and express wishes of the House in a Finance Act. Extra-statutory concessions are, almost by definition, to be viewed with suspicion and scepticism by Members of Parliament because they go against our decisions. It is not the Inland Revenue that governs the country or decides the taxation regime but the House of Commons. That is an important point. I am not saying that no extra-statutory concessions should ever be granted. But they should be approved and justified in the House through its elected representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>608</span>
I also differ from the views expressed by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield on another matter. He seemed to suggest that we were all complaining about the length of the Finance Bill. I have never complained about the length of a Finance Bill. Indeed, this evening we have tried to lengthen it. There are several matters on which we should like to add to the Bill, some of which we shall put forward on Report. Nor do I remember complaining about last year's Finance Bill, which was longer. I would be willing to sit in Committee for much longer to deal with extra-statutory concessions, and I hope that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield will support me in those representations to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend my hon. Friend's new clause to all members of the Committee. Opposition Members will support it if my hon. Friend presses it to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Ian Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a most interesting debate on extra-statutory concessions. Like other hon. Members, I compliment the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) for his interest in and progress on this subject. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and the hon. Members for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) and for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) rightly drew attention to the time and effort that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central has spent on his reaserch and to its consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sandwiched between two colleagues on the Treasury Bench who are far more expert on the subject than I—my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary who dealt with the previous clause and my right honourable Friend the Minister of State, will speak on the next clause. I do not have as long a history of considering extra-statutory concessions as other members of the Committee, but sometimes there is advantage in coming to a subject afresh and examining what has been done and recommended. It is an interesting process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read the documents to which the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central alluded, he introduced his new clause fairly by explaining the nature of extra-statutory concession and quoted the first sentence of the explanatory memorandum. It is instructive to read the next sentence, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Most concessions are made to deal with what are, on the whole, minor or transitory anomalies under the legislation and to meet cases of hardship at the margins of the code where a statutory remedy would be difficult to devise or would run to a length out of proportion to the intrinsic importance of the matter."</p></blockquote>
I suspect that the difference between Opposition Members and the Government is only a question of judgment about what is appropriate in terms of detail and scale and the best way of dealing with such matters in practical terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central raised several questions. I shall give him what quick responses I can. If he has raised other matters that I do not mention, I shall try to find out more and write to him. A number of the questions deal with the main points raised in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concessions are given under the Inland Revenue's care and management powers section 1 of the Taxes Management Act 1970, which is a consolidating Act. My right honourable and learned Friend the Chief Secretary talked about circumstances 80 or 90 years ago, and they are incorporated. No further figures are available for the cost of other concessions. I shall
<span class="label imageref" title="Sc1984-1985V002P0I0859">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>609</span>
examine the matter in the light of our debate and, if more information can be provided, I or one of my right honourable or hon. Friends will give it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central said that the difficulty arose because most concessions were operated locally—I emphasise that point—by individual tax offices. The business of collecting specific information about how many times concessions were applied or their value would be enormous and, in most cases, out of scale with the extra-statutory concessions. That problem is inherent in costing them. The system of extra-statutory concessions is designed to make the process operate more smoothly. It is designed not to change the basis of the provisions but to make them operate better in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about IR1, the existing Inland Revenue booklet. I think that it is in the Library, although I may be mistaken. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was referring to the new edition, which will be produced as soon as possible. I cannot give him an exact date. However, replying to the hon. Gentleman's question, my hon. Friend said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A revised booklet IR1 incorporating the newly published Inland Revenue concessions will be issued as soon as possible."</p></blockquote>
That announcement was only made on 17 May, and the booklet is not yet ready.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give some examples of concessions which have become legislation. That touches upon an interesting point that was raised by the hon. Member for Leeds, Central. Ministers sometimes conclude that these matters ought to be embodied in statutory form. I cannot give the hon. Member a set of fixed rules by which my colleagues make these decisions. Each case is taken on its merits against its significance, against the interaction with the statutes, against the way in which operation of the tax system applies and for administrative convenience and against the scale of the issue itself. Hon. Members' expenses were delt with last year, for example. They were previously done by extra-statutory concessions. Life assurance premium relief by deduction in the case of juvenile policies was extra-statutory concession A32 which was brought into play by the Finance Act 1982. A trader ceasing to be a resident was dealt with in 1981. Transfer of business from an individual or partnership to a company was also dealt with in 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was dealing with the clauses on stamp duty only a few evenings ago, I explained that some of the provisions of clauses 74 and 75 were to validate what had, until then, been in the form of extra-statutory concessions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I totally accept what the Minister is saying about there being occasions when extra-statutory concessions are put on a statutory basis. However, it would be interesting to look at the cases where the concessions are kept on an extra-statutory basis, without legislation. That is the area that I should like the Minister to examine. Are there guidelines to persuade Ministers to make particular decisions? How do they decide that they do not want to put a concession on a legislative basis but want to continue it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave an outline of the basis on which that is done. It is done case by case, in relation to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>610</span>
significance, importance, scale and relationship with other provisions. In practical terms, that is the only way in which it could be done, If the hon. Gentleman has further problems about that after he has looked at the record, perhaps he will write to me about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the examination of the chairmen of the Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise. Four years ago, the Comptroller and Auditor General commented in detail, and the Public Accounts Committee concluded that it had received no evidence to suggest that the Revenue Departments exercised their discretionary powers unreasonably. The last time that the question came up before the PAC was in 1982, and quite a number of questions were asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me on to the more general basis on which the extra-statutory concession system works. It is not right to say that there is no parliamentary approval. There is parliamentary approval in the sense, particularly now that disclosure is much more fully arranged, that hon. Members have any opportunity they care to choose to raise the question of any of the extra-statutory concessions. The concessions are reviewed regularly and considered by Ministers. They are open to objection from Members of Parliament or outside bodies. Disclosure itself conveys an important measure of control, and I compliment the hon. Gentleman for his part in that process. It is a valuable step. However, if particular forms of validation are then sought, we must consider what is involved. Under the existing system, concessions can be considered by a Committee of the House, which is a proper method of consideration. The Public Accounts Committee has given no indication of any objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The volume of disagreement to or questioning of the extra-statutory concession is zero. Parliament reasonably needs to devote its attention to genuinely contentious matters. If hon. Members wish to consider extra-statutory concessions, it would be better to do so in a specific way. A new clause could be tabled to a Finance Bill, or oral or written questions could be asked, like the many questions asked by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. Hon. Members could correspond with or meet Ministers. Any blanket system of the sort suggested by the hon. Gentleman's new clause is not practical, although I understand his reasoning and the points made by the hon. Member for Hodge Hill both today and a year ago. Attention is likely to attach only to specific extra-statutory concessions rather than to the generality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to pick holes in the new clause, but if one considers the implications one soon realises that difficulties would arise. Either the House ratifies the whole shooting match in this fashion or it does not ratify any of them, in which case it excludes all the existing concessions. That would create considerable problems. It would be better to focus attention on specific concessions. If difficulties arose, the purport behind a concession could be considered. Ministers might conclude on examining a concession that it was a candidate for inclusion in primary legislation. But let us remember that inclusion in legislation—primary, secondary or whatever—requires a degree of definition which is part of the problem in the first place. There will always be rough edges around any tax code, because such a code is very wide and touches an enormous range of activities, occupations and transactions.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0860">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>611</span>
Any attempt to impose a statutory definition on a concession could create other wrinkles. The chance of getting an administratively workable system would recede. The main objective would then be no more easy to attain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I do not think that we should accept the new clause. There may be a basic difference of principle between the two sides of the Committee about that, but there is no difference between us on the principle that the matter should be open to proper review. I do not wish to repeat the procedures, described by the hon. Gentlemen, by which concessions are reviewed. However, the Government, like previous Governments, have taken this matter seriously, and there has been an important change in the past month. To answer the hon. Gentleman's question, disclosure on that scale amounts to a completely new form of parliamentary control. Before any changes are made, we should let time pass and see how the system works now that Parliament and the outside world are in full possession of the information provided by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Economic Secretary and other Committee members for their kind words about the debate. The Economic Secretary modestly said that he came as a novice to the debate, but it is obvious that he has done his homework well. He said that he brought a fresh mind to it, which he has. He has come up with some novel reasons why the Government should not legislate, reasons which the Committee should consider carefully as it has not considered them before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary asked us to read the next line from the Financial Secretary's explanatory memorandum which stated that many concessions were of a minor or transitory nature. The new clause seeks to eliminate those and to concentrate the Committee's mind on the substantial ones. Any tax concession running into hundreds of thousands of pounds, in many cases into millions of pounds, and in one case into £10 million in every financial year, cannot be considered minor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary pointed out that concessions that went back long before the consolidated Taxes Act 1970 cannot be considered transitory. The matters that we are considering cannot be considered minor or transitory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary said that it was difficult to say how much money was involved because the procedure and administration of those concessions was so decentralised that it would be impossible or unduly expensive for the Treasury to collect that information. That is an interesting and undoubtedly uncontentious statement, but it surely proves my point that these decisions are made in tax offices around the country, well away from the control and knowledge of Parliament or Ministers. The Economic Secretary reveals a weakness in the control procedure in saying that the administration of the concessions occurs well away from political scrutiny and control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary said that there were precedents for concessions becoming statutes. Surely he is putting his head into the mouth of the new clause by admitting that several past concessions have become codified in statute. He specified the criteria of scale, significance and the working of the tax system. He
	<span class='label label-info column'>612</span>
mentioned the age of the very criteria I have been emphasising should be included in legislation. The criteria that apply to the concessions that have become statutes apply equally well to many of the present 209 concessions. Many of those are large—well over £500,000 in any one year. Many are well established, and many have considerable significance for taxpayers. The criteria that he agreed were those applied by the Treasury to that decision are those I am asking it to apply to concessions in their totality. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) acutely observed that the crucial point was how Ministers decided not to put them into legislation. By the Economic Secretary's own criteria, most of the concessions qualify for inclusion in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of accountability, the Economic Secretary said that the Public Accounts Committee looked at the Comptroller and Auditor General's report four years ago. When tens of millions of pounds in tax revenue are lost every year, is a report four years ago by the Public Accounts Committee sufficient accountability? Admirable though the job is that the Select Committee does for the House, a four-year-old procedure, in another Parliament, could not be considered by any hon. Member as being adequate accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hasten to add and to put on record that there is no question of officials of the Inland Revenue or Customs and Excise making unreasonable use of their powers. That is not why we seek to bring in the new clause to bring extra-statutory concessions within legislation. We make no criticism of the way that civil servants apply the concessions. We have taken this step because questions are left to the discretion of civil servants, after consultation with Ministers, when rightly and properly they should be the considered decision of the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister came finally to the question of parliamentary approval, and no doubt delighted the Committee with the novel reasons he put forward for the Government's inaction. He came up with the extraordinary suggestion that disclosing information somehow allows Government control of it. If that were so, we should have a great deal more control over the Government than we have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may have suppressed much information in many areas of public life, but they do allow disclosure of information. Sadly, the disclosure does not allow us, on behalf of our constituents, any control. Therefore, although the Economic Secretary gave an extremely ingenious explanation, the idea that disclosure equals control—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary says that he did not say that. I would give way to him, willingly. But he did say it, on two occasions. He said that as the information is placed in the Library of the House it is implicit that we have control. He said that we can raise specific matters in parliamentary questions and in correspondence with Ministers. It is kind of the hon. Gentleman to offer us those options, but what he is describing is not parliamentary control. It is a vital strength of our role as Members to be able to raise matters in parliamentary questions and in correspondence with Ministries, but neither gives Parliament as a

	<span class='label label-info column'>613</span>
whole, much less individual Members, any control over the issues raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary claimed that non-contentious financial legislation did not need to be debated or ratified. Most of these matters are non-contentious, but not all. The hon. Gentleman dealt with the subject at some length, saying that if we ratify something we are wasting time, and if we do not, it is unfair. It is an extraordinary admission for a Minister to say that he can predict in advance which legislation will be contentious and which will not. He might be prescient enough to know that something would be non-contentious, but he is suggesting that he could say, "We don't need to debate it; we don't need legislation." By that criteria we could all go home, and not bother ourselves with a great deal of legislation that might at first sight appear non-contentious. But it is only by scrutiny that we as a Parliament decide whether to spend money, or not to spend money, this way or that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary's final argument was that the Government could legislate for drafting reasons and that it would be difficult to define the concessions. But the same point arises again and again: when a concession is well established and has been used year after year—on hundreds, thousands and tens of thousands of occasions in each financial year—it appears that that concession, by de facto usage, has defined itself only too adequately and that it ought to be codified and come under the control of the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we face here two important issues. The first is at the root of all the House's problems: public money is at stake. I have estimated—I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would amalgamate in writing to me the estimates that he has given in individual answers—that the Government are spending between £50 million and £100 million a year. That is public money and it is probably right, being issued to the country by individual civil servants acting on behalf of Ministers. A great deal of money is at stake, and it should be properly considered by the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, a principle is at stake: this House should have control of finance. It is a precedent that has been well established over hundreds of years, and it is something that we jealously guard. It is at the very root of parliamentary democracy. For those reasons—the scale of the sums involved, and the principle of control of finance—I urge all hon. Members to support the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<li>In determining the extent of the mitigation (if any) under subsection (1) above, or whether to remit any penalty, interest or surcharge, the Commissioners or Tribunal may have regard to the following matters:</li>

	<ol>

	<li>the extent of the co-operation which the person concerned has given to the Commissioners in their investigation;</li>

	<li>whether the person concerned had at any time actively sought to deceive or mislead the Commissioners; had been merely negligent; or had himself been misled by someone on whose advice he might reasonably have relied;</li>

	<li>the degree of hardship which would be suffered by the person concerned if the full penalty, interest or surcharge was levied; and</li>

	<li>whether in all the circumstances of the case it is just and reasonable that the penalty, interest or surcharge be levied, in full or in part.</li></ol>

	<li>For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that the power of the Commissioners under this section may be exercised after, as well as before, an assessment is made under section 20 above; and where the power is exercised after an amount assessed has been notified to the person concerned, the Commissioners shall vary or, as the case may be, discharge the assessment and notify him accordingly.". —[

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an attempt to throw a lifeline to the Government to enable them to extricate themselves from the difficulties involved in VAT and the mitigation of penalties. It is a matter of considerable importance to traders, who need flexibility to conduct their affairs efficiently. It arises out of the difficulties that the Government got into in their attempt to introduce the power of mitigation of penalties for the VAT offences set out in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In contradistinction to many of the Bill's clauses on VAT, which are well drafted bearing in mind the difficulty of the subject matter, the rubric of mitigation in this instance was singularly cack-handed. Powers of mitigation are given in two different parts of the Bill. Clause 12(4) dealt specifically with the new civil penalty for tax evasion. Under that provision, a person liable to a penalty who co-operated with the commissioners could have the penalty reduced by the commissioners,
	<br><blockquote><p>"or, on appeal, a value added tax tribunal may reduce the penalty to an amount which is not less than half what it would have been apart from"</p></blockquote>
that power to mitigate. Clause 12 limits that power, which has been given to the VAT tribunal and to the commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 23 contained a much more general power of mitigation, but it was to be given only to the commissioners in respect of all offences, including those under clause 12, which deals with tax evasion. Clause 12 gives a specific power to commissioners and to VAT tribunals to reduce the penalty to a half. That was to be based expressly on the extent of the co-operation given by the taxpayer to the investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to see why that is not a satisfactory way to deal with the matter. There is little point in singling out clause 12 in relation to the power given to the commissioners and VAT tribunals. If there is a power of mitigation, it is strange that that power was limited to the commissioners and not given to the VAT tribunal, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0862">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>615</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) rightly said that that was not a sensible way to deal with the matter, because it isolated clause 12. He drew attention to the dangers of plea bargaining arising in such circumstances. In any event, if there is to be a power of mitigation, why should that power be limited simply to one tier of administration of the VAT penalty system? That point was also made by my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Keith committee said that there should be automatic penalties for such offences. A fair balance has been struck between what has and what has not been taken from the Keith committee report throughout this part of the Bill. For example, the Keith committee suggested that the default surcharge under clause 18 should not be introduced in the initial stages, but the Government felt it right to introduce it straight away. So the Government were willing to take from the Keith report what they agreed with and not what they did not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should also be stressed that the Keith committee's deliberations about the automatic nature penalties was really directed to the administrative convenience of having automatic penalties. It was not that the committee thought that there was anything just about there being no penalty to mitigate; it thought that automatic penalties might make the administration of the system easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the matter was debated, there was a feeling in some quarters that if a general power of mitigation were given it might imply that a VAT trader who committed an offence under the Act could go scot-free. That is an extraordinary argument, because we are dealing with mitigation. In any circumstance where there is mitigation, there is obviously a power to abrogate the penalty. But that goes to mitigation and not to the question of whether there is a penalty. It is a power in the tribunal—not a right that the taxpayers has—to allow a person to go scot-free in that way. Courts have power to mitigate penalties for any criminal offence under criminal law, so there is no reason why, inherently, it is a bad idea to have mitigation in VAT offences just as we have the power of mitigation in a range of offences across the criminal system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My recollection is that that observation was made in relation to clause 12 and the specific power to which the hon. Gentleman referred for a maximum of 50 per cent mitigation where the taxpayer co-operates with Customs and Excise. In conduct involving dishonesty, it would be wrong to have a situation in which there could be no penalty at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With very great respect to the hon. Gentleman, that is merely to restate the misconception. We are dealing with circumstances where a VAT offence has been committed, a fortiori. That is why we are discussing mitigation. The question is whether there should be a power of mitigation where either the commissioners or the VAT tribunal felt that there were certain circumstances whereby the penalty should be reduced. That question remains the same for clause 12 or for any clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a feeling that a general mitigation not limited to 50 per cent of the penalty might allow people
	<span class='label label-info column'>616</span>
to go scot-free, a term used several times. That conclusion is bizarre. Whenever the courts have a power to mitigate, they may eventually exercise it and, for example, give an absolute discharge where a criminal offence has been committed. In normal criminal offences, the power to mitigate does not mean that people go scot-free. The issue to be decided is that proposed by the Keith committee—whether there should be a power to mitigate or whether there should be automatic offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For two reasons, I believe that there should be a power to mitigate. First, Opposition Members have often said that we hold no brief for tax evaders, but there are a variety of possible circumstances. It may be unfair for the full weight of the penalty to be levied if there are factors that should be taken into account in mitigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty with automatic penalties is that, for example, someone who obstructed the VAT commissioners or the VAT tribunal throughout an investigation would receive the same penalty as someone who co-operated after initially committing an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is whether there should be a power to reduce the penalty in particular circumstances to recognise the different weights of offence. That is not to say that an offence has not been committed. If there were no offence, there would be no question of mitigation. However, if one can assess gradations of offence, surely a power of mitigation would reflect them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second argument for the power of mitigation comes from the other side—the Customs and Excise. No doubt the Minister will tell me whether I am right, but surely the Customs and Excise would be alarmed about having no incentive within the system to get offenders to co-operate. That was why clause 12 originally contained that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to understand the nature of mitigation. There is no question of such a power giving rise to great legal arguments about correct or incorrect mitigation. Mitigation lies within the total discretion of the courts. There will be no legal battles about whether mitigation has been exercised correctly. The commissioners or, on appeal, the VAT tribunal, will have an absolute right. They will be entitled to act entirely at their own discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, there is no question of the taxpayer having a right to have his offence mitigated if the circumstances for mitigation exist. The important distinction is that the VAT tribunal or the commissioners would have the power to mitigate if they so desired. The taxpayer will not be given the right to have his penalty mitigated so that he can argue for ever and a day about whether he has co-operated more than the next man. All the new clause gives is a power to the commissioners to reduce the penalty should they think fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister sometimes hints and says, "We already have a qualification on the offences in this part of the Bill. If the taxpayer can show that he has a reasonable excuse and that he has exercised due diligence, that will be a defence." It is, however, important to make the distinction clear. The question whether a taxpayer has exercised due diligence and has a reasonable excuse relates to whether an offence has been committed in the first place. It has nothing to do with mitigation. Producing the defence of reasonable excuse and due
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0863">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>617</span>
diligence is, therefore, no answer to the requirement for a power of mitigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 32 gives the commissioners or the tribunal a power to have regard to several matters when deciding whether to mitigate. I stress again that they do not have regard to them. It allows them to pay attention to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the extent of the co-operation which the person concerned has given",</p></blockquote>
which seems perfectly sensible; to
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether the person concerned had at any time actively sought to deceive ... the Commissioners; had been merely negligent; or had himself been misled by someone whose advice he might reasonably have relied";</p></blockquote>
to "the degree of hardship"; and—a general catch-all—to whether it is "just and reasonable" in the circumstances for mitigation to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the broad principles and guidelines on mitigation. I do not think that they should be a great party issue. In the VAT clauses, we are, by common consent, balancing the necessity to enforce the law with the need for justice for the taxpayer; and we are all trying to get the balance right. I believe that the power of mitigation not only gives the commissioners and VAT tribunals a discretion that they will value, but also allows a degree of flexibility which would otherwise be absent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Barney Hayhoe)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am extremely grateful to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr Fisher), to my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and, indeed, to the whole Committee for the way in which they received the references to what has happened to me. I am not sure that it has happened yet, because I have not yet been sworn, but it is nevertheless nice to be spoken of so kindly. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear"]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) for the helpful and constructive way in which he spoke to his new clause. It showed that there was no great difference of principle between us—that both sides were looking at the matter in a practical way, that our main objective was to achieve proper compliance with the taxation rules laid down by the House and that we wanted to do it in a reasonable and balanced fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, some inconsistency between what the hon. Gentleman has been saying today and what has been said in the past. I make no great complaint about that; anyone can stand up in this place and say that he has been consistent all his life, although I venture to suggest that few could make that claim about political issues with much hope of its being accepted by his colleagues. However, the withdrawal of clause 23 was at least in part a response to the comments of the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) on earlier clauses, and was welcomed by him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is at odds with the heart of the Keith approach, which is that there should first be a decriminalisation of many VAT offences. That has been welcomed on both sides of the Committee. The other side of the decriminalisation of all but the most serious fraud offences was that fixed and certain penalties should follow the actions that were short of criminal behaviour. The Government—as was acknowledged by the hon. Gentleman in moving the new clause—have modified the regime recommended by Keith by including the defence of "reasonable excuse". I say that in
	<span class='label label-info column'>618</span>
shorthand form: we debated the due diligence point earlier, and I said that I had it under consideration. It would not therefore be appropriate for me to refer to it now, but I may return to it on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The defence of reasonable excuse was not recommended by Keith, and it has been applied to clauses 13, 14, 15, 16 and 18 but not to clause 12. That is why there is that power of mitigation in clause 12 where there is an element of dishonesty in the offence under the clause. There was the belief—which I think was shared by the Committee—that when that offence was committed with an element of dishonesty, it was right that some penalty should be paid. Therefore the power of mitigation was given both to the commisioners and to the VAT tribunal, dependent upon the co-operation and the other circumstances, to vary between the 100 per cent and 50 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is no defence of reasonable excuse against offences under clause 12 because they involve an element of dishonesty. There cannot, by definition,be a defence of reasonable excuse. However, in all the other items, there now exists that defence of reasonable excuse. It therefore makes the more general powers of mitigation largely, although not wholly, redundant. The power of mitigation in the terms of clause 23 was included in the exposure clauses before the Government decided to include the reasonable excuse defence. In the context of not having a reasonable excuse defence,Keith said that exceptional powers of mitigation should be available to the commissioners in circumstances which he defined as
	<br><blockquote><p>"Exceptional cases of financial hardship, injustice or difficult points of tax law."</p></blockquote>
Those three circumstances are largely subsumed into the reasonable excuse defence which can now be argued. In addition—the point that I thought the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) took the other night when we debated this—commissioners have the extra-statutory powers to remit on grounds of equity or compassion, under those exceptional circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That practice is subject to annual examination by the National Audit Office on behalf of Parliament. It was commented upon in detail four years ago by the Comptroller and Auditor General and, on the basis of his report, by the PAC, as regards both the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise. The Committee concluded, in relation to individual remissions and also other discretionary powers to write off tax due, that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"had received no evidence to suggest that the revenue departments exercise their discretionary powers in this field unreasonably."</p></blockquote>
Individual remissions of penalties, interest and surcharge on grounds of equity are covered by the statutory reasonable excuse defence. That defence is, of course, fully appealable to the VAT tribunals. Remissions on grounds of compassion will be exceptional. It seems appropriate that Customs and Excise should remit in such cases on an individual basis under the discretionary arrangements which I have just described. The arrangements are subject to the proper supervision of the PAC. Therefore, I must advise the Committee to reject the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have a lot to answer for. When these provisions were originally debated, the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) was on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0864">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>619</span>
Opposition Front Bench. We debated clause 12(4), and he drew the Committee's attention to clause 23. He claimed that there was an inconsistency between the two. When the Minister replied to the debate, he said that he could see the strength of the hon. Gentleman's argument and he hinted, on two occasions before clause 23 was reached, that he was minded to deal with the inconsistency by recommending that clause 23 should not be included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition did not object to that either on those occasions or when we reached clause 23. They now have the nerve to seek to reintroduce the provisions in a new clause. It seeks not only to recreate clause 23, but to go further and give an appeal to the VAT tribunal. I find that incredible. My right honourable Friend was very charitable when he said that the Opposition had been inconsistent. People are entitled to be inconsistent over a period, but this has happened in three weeks. The taxpayer would be considerably worse off under the new clause than under the original clause 23.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is really unfortunate that, after what I think the Minister would agree was a constructive debate, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) should shove a particularly unhelpful and misleading oar into our proceedings. I imagine that his embarrassment stems from the fact that, if the new clause is pressed to a Division, he might find it difficult not to support it, given what he has said previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first to raise the problem inherent in the provision—the fact that a person could go scot-free if a power of mitigation were introduced—was the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. He did so in Committee in col. 133 on 16 May. Therefore, if anyone is the author of our difficulties, it is the hon. Gentleman. But, then, modesty was never his strong suit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>620</span>
This is a very important issue for taxpayers. We should not have an argy-bargy across the Committee but work out what is best for the taxpayer. That is what a responsible person would do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the Minister's point about the Keith committee. The gravamen of what I was saying still remains. It is one thing to provide for a statutory defence to charges, whether or not there is any penalty or any offence. It is quite another to give a general power of mitigation. I paid great attention to the Minister, but I still think it wrong to have no power of mitigation. I appreciate that it is a matter of judgment, but that is my judgment. Therefore I ask my hon. Friends to press the matter to a vote.
