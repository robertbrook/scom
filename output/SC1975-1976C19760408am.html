	<section>

	<div class='title'>APPLICATIONS FOR TENANCY OF THE HOLDING</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>"(1) Any eligible person may within the relevant period (as defined in the preceding section) apply to the Tribunal for a direction entitling him to a tenancy of the holding.</p>

	<p>(2)Where only one application is made under this section the Tribunal, if satisfied that the applicant is an eligible person, shall determine whether he is in their opinion a suitable person to become the tenant of the holding.</p>

	<p>(3) Where two or more applications are made under this section, then, subject to sub-section (4) below, subsection (2) above shall apply to each of the applicants as if he were the only applicant.</p>

	<p>(4) If the applicants under this section include a person validly designated by the deceased in his will as the person he wished to succeed him as tenant of the holding, the Tribunal shall first make a determination under subsection (2) above as regards that person, and shall do so as regards the other applicant or each of the other applicants only if the Tribunal determine that the person so designated is not in their opinion a suitable person to become the tenant of the holding.</p>

	<p>(5) If under the preceding provisions of this section only one applicant is determined by the Tribunal to be in their opinion a suitable person to become the tenant of the holding, the Tribunal shall, subject to section (Opportunity for landlord to obtain Tribunal's consent to operation of notice to quit) of this Act, give a direction entitling him to a tenancy of the holding.</p>

	<p>(6) If under the preceding provisions of this section each of two or more applicants is determined by the Tribunal to be in their opinion a suitable person to become the tenant of the holding, the Tribunal shall, subject to subsection (9) below, determine which of those applicants is in their opinion the more suitable person to become the tenant of the holding and shall, subject to section (Opportunity for landlord to obtain Tribunal's consent to operation of notice to quit) of this Act, give a direction entitling that applicant to a tenancy of the holding.</p>

	<p>(7) Before making a determination under subsection (2) above in the case of any applicant the Tribunal shall afford the landlord an opportunity of stating his views on the suitability of that applicant.</p>

	<p>(8) In making a determination under subsection (2) above in the case of a particular applicant, or a determination under subsection (6) above as between two or more applicants, the Tribunal shall have regard to all relevant matters, including—

	<ol>

	<li>the extent to which the applicant or each of those applicants has been trained in, or has had practical experience of, agriculture;</li>

	<li>the age, physical health and financial standing of the applicant or each of those applicants; and</li>

	<li>the views (if any) stated by the landlord on the suitability of the applicant or any of those applicants.</li></ol></p>

	<p>(9) Where subsection (6) above would apply about from this subsection, the Tribunal may, with the consent of the landlord, give instead a direction specifying any two, any three or any four of the applicants within that subsection, and entitling the specified applicants to a joint tenancy of the holding.</p>

	<p>(10) In this section " will" includes codicil, and for the purposes of this section a person shall be taken to be validly designated by the deceased in his will as the person he wishes to succeed him as tenant of the holding if, but only if, a will of the deceased which is the subject of a grant of probate or administration either—

	<ol>

	<li>contains an effective specific bequest to that person of the deceased's tenancy of the holding; or</li>

	<li>does not contain an effective specific bequest of that tenancy, but does contain a statement specifically mentioning the holding or the deceased's tenancy thereof and exclusively designating that person (in whatever words, and whether by name or description) as the person whom the deceased wishes to succeed him as tenant of the holding.</li></ol></p>

	<p>(11) For the purposes of subsection (10) above a statement which is framed so as to designate as mentioned in paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) of that subsection different persons in different circumstances shall be taken to satisfy that paragraph if, in the events which have happened, the statement exclusively designates a particular person.</p>

	<p>(12) direction under this section given in favour of a person by reason of his being a person validly designated by the deceased as mentioned in subsection (4) above shall be valid even if the probate or administration by virtue of which he was such a person at the giving of the direction is subsequently revoked or varied.</p>

	<p>(13) For the purposes of this Part of this Act an application under subsection (1) above which is withdrawn or abandoned shall be treated as if it had never been made ".— [

	<i>Amendment (f) proposed to the proposed clause</i>—[6th April]—in line 37 after 'suitability', insert and eligibility'.</p>

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was in the middle of moving Amendment (f) when we ended our last sitting. I was saying that it would be important that, when the tribunal was considering the relevant matters, if it should have the opportunity of hearing the views of the landlord, not only on the suitability but also on the eligibility of the applicant. It seems to me that a situation could arise where, when there was a discussion in the tribunal with regard to the age, health and financial standing and the experience of the applicant, in certain circumstances there might be a dispute about the very basis of the eligibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has recently been a celebrated case in the judicial sector of anotherplace with regard to the parentage of a certain peer. I can imagine that there certain arguments could arise before the tribunal as to whether the applicant was the son of the deceased tenant or whether he was the brother: I can imagine all sorts of things which might be argued. Surely there should be an opportunity for the landlord to make an assertion, under certain parts of new Clause 8, that the applicant was not an eligible person. Indeed, where else would there be an opportunity for allegations of that sort to be made? I can perfectly well imagine that, because we are giving to the closefamily of a deceased tenant the almost near right to inherit the tenancy—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Prescriptive right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: —as my hon. Friend says, prescriptive right—the prospective tenant could see that as something of immense value, with not only prestige but a huge amount of wealth going with it. Many prospective tenants might be prepared to go to all sorts of ends in order to make a claim on a tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there should be an opportunity for the landlord not only to discuss, andexpress his views about the suitability of an applicant, but also whether that applicant was eligible. Certainly he might wish to discuss and contest how long a period the applicant had worked on the farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1134</span>
That is something which I could imagine disputes arising over. It would be better if this clause had the word "eligibility' included as well, so thatthe landlord would have the opportunity of discussing or making representations about every aspect of the applicant and the tribunal would feel that all possible points which were in the landlord's mind had been raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose and effect of this amendment is to add to the scope of the landlord's intervention permitted under subsection (8) (c). The effect wouldbe that the landlord would be able to comment to the Agricultural Land Tribunal not only on the applicant's suitability but on his eligibility as wel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am grateful to the hon. Member for proposing the amendment, I wouldpoint out that paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) is based on the premise that any good landlord who knows and takes an interest in his tenants, and therefore knowshow good or bad a farmer each one is, would almost certainly know how good or how bad a farmer a close relative is as well had he worked on the holding for five years out of the last seven, as we require, before the tenant's death. t is only right and proper, therefore, that the landlord should be permitted to comment on the suitability of people who are applying to becomea tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, of course, the landlord would probably know better than anyone else—and certainly better than the tribunal—whether an applicant was putting forward a false claim of eligibility—for example, that he had only worked on the holding for three years although perhaps claiming that he had done so for five, or that he was the occupier of a commercial farm elsewhere when he said that he was not. These are aspects which concern eligibility as detailed in new Clause 8. I am happy to reassure hon. Members, however, that the landlord will have the right to contest eligibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 8 (2) ensures that any applicant to the tribunal must give notice of his application to the landlord, and, under the procedures to be laid down by statutory instrument, the landlord will then become the respondent to the application. He will receive a copy of the form of application setting out the details relied on by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0623">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1135</span>
the applicant to establish eligibility, and if he chooses to do so he may dispute those details at the hearing and, of course, bring evidence and witnesses into court. We shall also provide for the tenant to be informed that his eligibility is being challenged. The amendment therefore appears to be unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister has said would be reasonable were onedealing entirely with matters of fact. Much will depend on the kind of amendments the Government have threatened or promised to come forward with, depending on which side of the Committee one sits, in terms of such matters, for example, as education. This possibility could impart quite a degree of subjectivity into the criteria of eligibility in terms of new Clause 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be guided by my hon. Friend, but I think that we on this side, while not pressing this matter, should at least keep our powder dry to see how new Clause 8 turns out when it is presented to the House on Report. t is hardly adequate and reasonable for the Minister of State, in view of the arguments I have submitted in terms of the subjectivity which could be importedinto new Clause 8, to rely upon regulations the sight of which has been denied the Committee so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) pleaded with the Parliamentary Secretary at our last sitting that an advance copy of these regulations, albeit in draft, should be available before the proceedings advancedmuch further. I take it that what he had in mind was the Report stage. Obviously, these regulations are a key factor. I hope that the Minister will beable to make some indication as to his ability to respond on that issue when replying to this admittedly rather narrow point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton). We shall need to think on this matter interms of any amendments that may be tabled on Report. In view of what the Minister has said—that, as I understand it the landlord will have a full opportunity at the hearing to contest any matters of eligibility as wellas suitability—which is
	<span class='label label-info column'>1136</span>
welcome, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the proposed clause, Amendment (k) in line 63, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(14) The Tribunal shall not have jurisdiction to make an order for costs against the landlord of the holding in proceedings under this Part of this Act'.</p></blockquote>
This is an absolutely straightforward amendment, designed to avoid adding insult to injury on the part of the landlord who, after all, is not the person who has sought this position which is confirmed on the successor-tenant under these new clauses. In the past it has been open to the tribunal to award costs. It seems, under these new, more stringent measures, that it would be fair to absolve the landlord from the award of costs in any circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an unnecessary amendment. The position as regards costsis quite clear. Each party bears its own expenses and the costs of the actual hearing are normally met from public funds. But if it appears to the tribunal that any person concerned in a reference or application, including any Minister or Government Department, has acted frivolously, vexatiously or oppressively in applying for or in connection with a reference, it may makethat person pay to any other person a specified sum in payment of the costsincurred by him for the taxed amount of those costs. It is not Parliament'sintention that costs should be automatically paid by the loser, and the power given to tribunals is deliberately narrow. Its purpose is to check the unjustifiable use of the tribunal machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it extremely difficult to envisage a case arising under the family succession scheme where the circumstances would be such that the tribunal would award costs against either party. It is always for the applicant to make out his case before the tribunal, and merely because the landlord gives adverse views as to the applicant's suitability to become the tenant, or because he applies for the tribunal's consent to the operation of the notice to quit under new Clause 11, it would be necessary for his conduct in connection with the reference to the tribunal to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1137</span>
frivolous, vexatious or oppressive, and this would apply in only very exceptional cases. I hope, therefore, that that explanation will enable the hon.Member to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole of the Minister of State's case hangs on what he said about no costs being allocated to either party unless, in certain circumstances, it could be demonstrated that frivolity, vexatiousness or oppressiveness had arisen as a result of the actions of that party. I hope I understand the Minister correctly in this matter. Before I go on, perhaps the Minister would draw the attention of the Committee to the part of the legislation which leads him to inform us along these lines. I cannot readily detect it myself. This is very important. The Minister of State said that this would all be carried from the public purse. I would like, and I think it is proper to ask for, clarification in these circumstances, because the virtue that underlies the amendment is that it would be to protect the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The landlord would not be the initiator, in any circumstances, of a hearingof the Agricultural Land Tribunal. It may be that actions on his part have precipitated a situation, but we live in a free society and one can only presume that proceedings have been set in hand, quite properly, under new Clause 8 and subsequent Clauses—including the proceedings adumbrated in new Clause 10—and the tribunal is ticking off eligibility and suitability, and there is the landlord doinghis bit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But he has not initiated anything, and it is extremely difficult to envisage circumstances in which he was "frivolous, vexatious or oppressive", sincehis rights 
	<i>vis-a-vis</i>the tribunal are restricted to "views (if any) stated by the landlord on the suitability of the applicant or any of those applicants." So I should like it to be quite clear that only in the very restricted circumstances of frivolity, vexatiousness or oppressiveness—and it is very difficult to see these applying at all to the landlord—would there be any question of costs being attributed to the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the basic point on which the Minister of State relies, that the cost of the hearing would be borne by the public purse. I take it that this does not
	<span class='label label-info column'>1138</span>
include costs of representation, and I should like clarification of this point. I pay tax at X per cent. in the £, and it is deemed—and Italk about myself, K. M. Stainton—that I should therefore chip in forproceedings before the Agricultural Land Tribunal which have to do with resolving private property rights. Why on earth should K. M. Stainton, or any of his constituents, be chipping in for that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would point out that agricultural land tribunals are constituted under the Agriculture Act 1947, and that the procedure is very clearly set out. The tribunals normally sit in public, evidence may be given orally, by affidavit or by written statement, and witnesses are examined, cross-examined and reexamined in the normal way. The proceedings are similar to those in court, in regard to which we all have an idea of what public and other financial liability there may be. The parties to the dispute and their representatives and expert witnesses may attend and be involved in inspections of holdings and so on, and normally the costs are paid by the Minister, with the parties paying their own expenses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Are copies of the Financial Resolution applicable to this Bill—available to the Committee here and now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, they are on the table.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I looked, and I did not see them. But, with respect, I thought the Minister of State could kindly do the Committee the courtesy of waiting until we had the Financial Resolution. We are now talking about money matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister could explain whether he was referring to the costs of the party who succeeds against the other one, or only tothe costs of the tribunal. That is what I could not understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that hon. Members have had time to do their homework on the Financial Resolution. I have been asked about the power of the Agricultural Land Tribunal to award costs. The Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1954, in Section 5, states:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0625">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1139</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) An Agricultural Land Tribunal, where it appears to them that any person concerned in a reference to them (including any Minister of the Crowp or Government department so concerned) has acted frivolously, vexatiously or oppressively in applying for or in connection with the reference, may order that person to pay to any other person either a specified sum in respect ofthe costs incurred by him at or with a view to the hearing or the taxed amount of those costs; and an order may be made under this subsection whether or not the reference proceeds to a hearing.

	<ol>

	<li>Any costs required by an order under this section to be taxed may be taxed in the county court according to such of the scales prescribed by county court rules for proceedings in the county court as may be directed by the order or, if the order gives no direction, by the county court.</li>

	<li>Any sum payable by virtue of an order of an Agricultural Land Tribunal under this section shall, if the county court so orders, be recoverable by execution issued from the county court or otherwise as if payable under an order of that court; and, subject to county court rules, an application for an order of the county court under this subsection may be made 
	<i>ex parte.</i></li>

	<li>The powers of the county court under this section may be exercised by the registrar."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
With regard to the Financial Resolution, as these clauses are amendments to the Bill, they do not appear in the Financial Resolution, which will, therefore, have to be amended later. I hope that that clarifies the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a rarified atmosphere that I cannot pretend to inhabit, but I have a right to know as a taxpayer where my money goes. My submission is that the 1947 Act, which started the whole procedure and laid down the scope of the Agricultural Land Tribunal, was entirely different from that which is now envisaged. If one said that these tribunals are comparatively moribund at the present time, I do not think one would be exaggerating. But the number of cases, and the different and new personnel that will be required in order to deal effectively and expeditiously with applications under Part II of this Bill, when it is enacted, will impose a considerable burden. We are denied any knowledge of that burden, since the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum attached to the Bill is restricted to the document originally published, and nothing has been produced to supplement or amend it despite all the outpourings, which have been extremely helpful. Nothing has been produced by the Minister to supplement the memorandum so far as this new Part II of the Bill is concerned. I urge the Government to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1140</span>
think again about the whole of the financing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like an assurance from the Minister of State, since he has conceded that the Financial Resolution will require amendment, that there will be an opportunity to debate this matter root and branch. There is a very real issue of principle here, which I am sure will evoke a very warm and sympathetic response from hon. Members opposite. I am sure that the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) will agree that it is at least questionable, to put it no higher, that individual taxpayers should fund the resolution of a private property dispute. But that is what we have come down to, having moved away from the original concept of the Agricultural Land Tribunalas enunciated in 1947 and which was comparatively restricted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The substantial point, however, is Amendment (k) and I can but think that, since the landlord is the negative element in all this—he is not the activator—he is entitled to seek full protection as set out in the amendment, and should not merely have to rely on the fact that he is not frivolous, vexatious or oppressive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great sympathy with my hon. Friend on this financial point, but he is labouring under a great weight of precedent, because I understand that practically every tribunal in the country has its costs paid by the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On property matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is really no difference between private property matters and appeal to an industrial tribunal for wrongful dismissal. My hon. Friend's constituents do not have much to do with either. But where my hon. Friend is on a very strong point is in the fact that I cannot see how a landlordcan be one of those three things, because he is the passive party. He is not the active party. So the Minister must tell us, before we agree to withdraw this amendment, how he sees this happening, because the implication is that actions by the landlord in resisting a claim at the Agricultural Land Tribunal could be frivolous, vexatious or oppressive.

of the Council on Tribunals, which has been consulted about the implications of the provisions of Part II of the Bill and has made no comments. But, as the hon.

They will have to be completely reorganised. I understand that it will be recommended that assessors should sit with the tribunals.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: With due respect, the hon. Gentleman is making heavy weather out of this. We are clarifying the position so as to avoid the misunderstandings which may arise under the procedure to be followed by the landlord.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see why the hon. Gentleman should get excited.

	<br><blockquote><p>'(14) Any provision of this Part of this Act and any actions taken in accordance therewith or let go by arrangement or default shall be without prejudice to the provisions of the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975'.</p></blockquote>
The effect of adding subsection (14) along the lines indicated is to make crystal clear that the provisions of the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 remain paramount. That Act owed its parentage to the Law Revision Committee, and it was designed to look after a spouse or child who felt that he or she, had been hardly done by by giving recourse to the courts against the estate of the deceased. The deceased might have been bloody-minded in drawing the will. We deal repeatedly in the new clauses with the dispositions of testators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, in subsections (11) and (12), there are innuendoes which couldimply conflict with or even superiority over the inheritance provisions of the 1975 Act. The whole tenor of subsection (11) is disturbing in the parameter I have just described. The closing words of subsection (12) are as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be valid even if the probate or administration by virtue of which hewas such a person at the giving of the direction is subsequently revoked orvaried."</p></blockquote>
By whom? By the county court under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975? That is a possible interpretation. Perhaps the Minister of State would prefer to leave this to his legal colleagues on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act passed quietly through the House. t was regarded as a lawyers' Act,but I have recently been involved in a constituency case deriving from it. t is an important piece of social engineering an expression which readily pours out of the mouths of hon. Members opposite. It is a commendable piece of legislation, and I should like to think that it is not rescinded by anything that we are now attempting to put on the Statute Book in the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the rather fine points made by the hon. Member forSudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton), and his natural concern, which arises even now when there is no guiding legislation. The hon. Gentleman apparently suspects that the family succession clauses could prejudice in some waythe provisions of the Inheritance (Provision for Family and
	<span class='label label-info column'>1144</span>
Dependants) Act 1975. I emphasise that this is not really the case. The aimof the Act is to enable a close relative of a deceased person who considersthat he or she has not been reasonably provided for in the deceased's will to enter a claim through the county court or High Court—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have to be careful about our terminology. The Minister of State used the expression "not really the case". Is it, or is it not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not so. The hon. Gentleman obviously suspects that the family succession clauses could prejudice in some way the provisions of the Act regarding inheritance, but I tell him quite clearly that this is not thecase. The aim of the Act is to enable a close relative of a deceased personwho considers that he or she has not been reasonably provided for in the deceased's will to enter a claim through the county court or the High Court against the deceased person's estate. I stress the word "estate".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, and to see how the provisions apply in relation to the family succession scheme, let us consider the case of a deceased tenant-farmer who makes only one bequest in his will, to the effect that the tenancy of his holding and all his worldly goods shall pass to his elder son John. His widow and daughter can claim through the court for an order against the deceased tenant's estate. If the court is satisfied that reasonable financial provision has not been made for them, it can make out one or more orders for payment to be made. It will then be up to the executors of the deceased person's estate to comply with the order and pay up before the estate is wound up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An applicant for a deceased person's tenancy, on the other hand, is applying to take over the tenancy when the deceased person's lease expires, by which time the estate ought in normal circumstances to have been wound up. The two sets of legislation therefore carry on regardless of each other. There can be little doubt, however, that where this new measure has been successfully involked the elder son John may find that some of his inheritance will have had to be sold to pay off the claimants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question therefore of the family succession scheme interfering in any way with the provisions of the 1975 Act, so
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0628">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1145</span>
it will not prejudice the Act and the amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not say this presumptuously, but I shall want to think carefully about what the Minister of State said. I notice that he dealt withthe specific case of a bequest to the elder son John. These permutations can become highly complicated. The Minister did not attempt to grapple with the words in the amendment " let go by arrangement". There are specific provisions in Section 5 of the 1975 Act which are designed to prevent the testator from making dispositions or doing acts which would result in situationsdetrimental to certain members of his family for whom he has an on-going responsibility subsequent to his death.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make progress, so I shall not press the amendment at this point. I should like to think that the Minister of State will assent to correspondwith me on this matter and let me have a full explanation, especially of the further point I made about " let go by arrangement". That would be usefulto me in my consideration. Perhaps we can see where we get to on Report. Onthat note, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the proposed clause, Amendment (s), in line 63, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>' (16) Rentals received by a landlord in respect of any tenancy arising from a direction by the Tribunal shall be exempted from any surcharge on income tax above the rate which such tax would be applicable to earned income'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to add a further subsection to the clause. There was another new amendment, Amendment (r), which you ruled out of order, Mr. Costain. I mention it now because I should like it to be clear on the record that this matter has been referred to. I hope that it is not beyond the boundsof human ingenuity to devise an amendment that would be in order, and I am sure that Mr. Speaker would have more regard to such an amendment on Reportif it were possible to demonstrate that attempts had been made to raise thematter in Committee, only to be repulsed by our redoubtable Chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of the subsection is wrong. It should be subsection (14), because one subsection has gone by default and the other is out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1146</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the amendment is that investment surcharge would not applyto the net profits. We are talking about the net situation, not the gross situation. This would be net profits arising from a tenancy which had come about as a result of Part II of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The logic behind this is impeccable. The landlord finds himself locked in. He could well be locked in to this particular farm investment for up to 60 years or more even on the two successions. One could deduce that it starts with a person who is 
	<i>in situ.</i>One can only presume that the logic behind the surcharge on investment income derives from the theory that the owner of capital is free to make displacements of that capital to his advantage and to his liking. That would no longer be the case in terms of tenanciesthat come about as a result of this envisaged legislation. The landlord would be locked in. Were he to put that farm on the market there is no doubt that the price it would fetch would be less than—I do not know what the expression is, perhaps my Friend the hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Full vacant possession. The percentage below that, which a farm which was subject to one of these tenancies would produce, would be of very substantial dimensions. It might be more than a third. Perhaps my hon. Friend would indicate the figure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is highly significant. The owner of capital, that is landlord, if he wishes to make a re-disposition of his investments to his best advantage, be it financial advantage or in terms of security planning, would have to suffer a loss of

	<span class='label label-info column'>1147</span>
40 per cent on what he would otherwise realise. I contend, therefore, that the landlord in this situation, into which he has been placed by the Bill if we pass it, is disadvantaged and should not be subject to the investment income surcharge in terms of the net rental receipts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should preface my remarks by the usual disclaimer about the drafting of the amendment. It may well be that I have not got it right. I am sure the Minister of State would not seek to make an issue of that. If it is not right, it can be put right before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am talking about the principle. It should be noted that I have chosen, inco-operation with my hon. Friends, to talk about income tax as opposed to corporation tax. There would be no relief in terms of giant institutions, and charities would not be affected because they are tax-exempt. One might run into a difficult area where there is an overlap between private ownershipand the small company-type operation. it is in that kind of area that my drafting might be defective but, given a piece of paper and a candle, one could work on this and produce the right kind of answer, if we are concerned with technicalities. I hope the theme of what I have said commends itself tothe Minister of State. I anxiously look forward to his response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support my hon. Friend on this matter. He is abbsolutely right. It seems to me that one is always talking of landlords as if they sit there and draw in revenue and do not do a thing for it. They are always treated as if they are not earning money. They do have an intense interest and do work on the estates.Most of the landlords I know have a great interest and spend a lot of time and money in their own work on estates whichthey own. I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) has been taxing the resources of the Committee this morning with his attempted change of definition. Clearly, as he said, the purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earned income is defined in Section 530 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970. Broadly it means any income
	<span class='label label-info column'>1148</span>
received from an employment, a pension or a trade, business or profession. Income from the letting of property does not normally qualify as earned income unless the nature and extent of any services rendered by the landlord are such as to constitute the carrying on of a trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is, I assume, to enable the rental received by a landlord under a tenancy, arising from a direction by the tribunal, to be treated for income tax purposes as earned income rather than as investment income. I do not see how a direction by the tribunal can affect the nature or quality of the income. I have some difficulty in seeing any logic or justification for treating this income differently from any other form of rental income. I am sure my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer holds much the same views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has been trying to make the point, although not in too much detail, that there may be services carried on by the landlord which would change the category from unearned income to earned income. These are matters which the Inland Revenue will take into account when the landlord comes to make his submissions at the appropriate time. I propose, therefore, that the amendment should be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the Minister of State correctly, is he inviting me to consider putting down an amendment on Report which would define this type of income in terms of a select category of the schedules as specified in the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970, and in the subsections thereto, in order to achieve the ends I am after? Is he relying on the technicalities of that Act in order to repulse my amendment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman did not deal at all with the denuding of the capital base of the landlord, which could be as much as 40 per cent. He ignored that. It is a very great assumption to assume that the volume and quality of the landlord's income would remain unimpaired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reluctant to let this matter go, more especially as we have paid very little regard to the financial impact of these laws. I am out of order on Amendment (r); I was lucky with Amendment (s). This is the first occasion onwhich we have discussed the financial impact on the landlord, and I am not letting go of this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>'(1) Before giving a direction under section (Applications for tenancy pf the holding) (5) or (6) of this Act in a case where a notice to quit to which section (Restriction on operation of notice to quit given by reason of death of tenant) (1) of this Act applies has been given, the Tribunal shall afford the landlord an opportunity of applying for their consent under this section to the operation of the notice.</p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause protects the landlord's interests. It enables him to present a case to the Agricultural Land Tribunal for the repossession of the holding.Under the existing law a landlord is unable to seek the consent of the Agricultural Land Tribunal to a notice to quit on one or more of the grounds set out in Section 25(1) of the Agricultural Holdings Act. It might help the Committee if I were to say briefly what those grounds are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first ground is that the landlord requires to regain possession in the interests of good husbandry of the holding, in</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1150</span>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided</i>: Ayes 6, Noes 7.</p>

	<p>
	<i>New Clause 10 added to the Bill.</i></p>

	<p>other words, because the farmer has been farming the land badly.</p>

	<p>The second ground is in the interests of sound estate management. Here the landlord will have in mind in particular the need to reorganise his estate,for example, into fewer larger holdings.</p>

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>The third ground is that the land is required for purposes of agricultural research, educational experiment or demonstration, or for use either as smallholdings or allotments.</p>

	<p>The fourth ground, a particularly important one from the landlord's point of view, is that greater hardship would be caused by withholding consent to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0631">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1151</span>
operation of the notice to quit than by giving consent; and finally, that the landlord proposes to terminate the tenancy so that the land shall be putto another use for which planning consent is not required. This applies in particular to the use of land, for example, for afforestation.</p>

	<p>New Clause 11 adds a sixth ground to the five already in the 1948 Act, namely, that the holding itself is smaller than a commercial unit and the landlord proposes to amalgamate it with other land, within two years of gaining possession to form a commercial agricultural unit. I have drawn the Committee's attention, in our discussion on new Clause 8, to the role of the Ministry of Agriculture in certifying whether the existing holding or the proposed new holding is or will be a commercial unit.</p>

	<p>Two matters should be noted. First, any decision by the Agricultural Land Tribunal on the landlord's notice to quit will be subject to the fair and reasonable landlord test as set out in the proviso to Section 25 (1) of the 1940 Act, which provides that the tribunal must withhold its consent to the operation of the notice to quit if it appears to the tribunal that a fair and reasonable landlord would not insist on possession. This is the tenant'sopportunity to raise the question of hardship if he has not had the opportunity to do so beforehand.</p>

	<p>The other point to be noted is that the provisions of Section 29 of the 1948 Act apply in relation to an application for the Agricultural Land Tribunal's consent under this clause as they do under the provisions of the 1948 Act. These are that any conditions made by the tribunal when giving a direction must be complied with, subject to the penalty under that Act for non-compliance, namely a fine by the tribunal of a sum equivalent to two year's rent for the holding. Clearly, such a condition would be that an amalgamation must take place within a specified period. Subsections (4) and (5) deal with procedural matters.</p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of these amendments is to make sure that in the best interests of agricultural production, good estate management and good husbandry, amalgamations at the end of tenancies should not be prevented, perhaps through misunderstanding on the part of the Agricultural Land Tribunal. Their purpose is to ask the Minister to give an explanation in respect ofsome of the cases to which I shall refer, to show whether our fears are well grounded. I am advised that new para. (
	<i>j</i>)is unnecessary under Section 25 (1) of the 1948 Act because it is already covered by Section 25 (1) (b). Again, I fear that the new para. (f), by dealing expressly with the amalgamation of non-commercial units, may be interpreted by the Agricultural Land Tribunal as meaning that only that kind of amalgamation shall be permitted. I hope the Minister will answer these points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer briefly to some of our fears. It might be desirable to amalgamate anon-commercial unit and a commercial unit, or 
	<i>vice versa,</i>to make thebest use of buildings and machinery or to rationalise boundaries where, as often happens, one holding is adjacent or almost adjacent to another. UnderSection 25 (1) (b), in relation to one of the deadly sins—and the most deadly sin is that of dying—a tribunal might think that this was not the case if new para. (
	<i>F</i>)were to be added. Again, although the newpara. (
	<i>f</i>)starts with the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Without prejudice to paragraph (b)"</p></blockquote>
it is thought that the paragraph would only confuse what is at present very clear under Section 25 (1). t seems to me that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0632">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1153</span>
the proper course would be to exclude non-commercial units here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second amendment seeks to leave out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"to form such a commercial unit"</p></blockquote>
If these words are retained, it will mean that new paragraph (f) would apply only where there are commercial reasons for amalgamation, and might not apply where a non-commercial unit was proposed to be amalgamated with an existing commercial unit. I hope the Minister will look at that. I believe he will agree that the tribunal should be free to allow any amalgamations in the interests of sound estate management, the better farming of land and thebetter production of food from the land to the benefit of agriculture as a whole. I hope the Minister will be able to advise us of these matters and say whether the concern behind our amendments has any foundation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would ask my hon. Friend whether he can give me a specific answer on this point. What would be the position under the legislation of someone who has a non-viable unit but is able to support a family because he has the grazing rights? Would that person be protected and have a right of succession?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Grazing rights would not apply in relation to an agricultural holding in this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I cannot see that I can support the inclusion of subsection (3), because I consider that that person has just as much right to protection in this respect as the holder of a viable unit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) has moved an amendment to leave out the whole of subsection (3) and has referred to Amendment (b), which also seeks to leave out certain words in the subsection. The effect would be to delete the additional ground (
	<i>f</i>)in the new clause which a landlord can cite in support of a notice to quit. Subsection(3) (
	<i>f</i>)is similar to a provision in the Scottish legislation. Its purpose is to provide a balancing provision for the landlord by enabling himto put forward to the Agricultural Land Tribunal a specific proposal that because the holding
	<span class='label label-info column'>1154</span>
is below commercial size he intends to amalgamate it with other land withintwo years of the end of the deceased's tenancy, to form a commercial holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a much more powerful and positive ground than that in current use, and I refer to Section 25(1)(b) of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948, under which a landlord can serve a notice to quit in the interests of sound estate management, one purpose of which would be the reorganisation of the holdings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (b) is very much tied up with this. The encouragement of the formation of commercial units has been the policy of this and previous Governments since the introduction of the amalgamation scheme under the AgricultureAct, 1967. The amendment seeks to delete the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to form a commercial unit"</p></blockquote>
and thus apply this special provision to any proposed amalgamation, whetherto form a commercial unit or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe hon. Members would agree that this would both widen and weaken this special provision and make it no different a ground in effect, from thatalready set out in Section 25 (1) (
	<i>b</i>) of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948, whose meaning is normally taken to cover proposals for amalgamation. Therefore, the amended subsection (3) (
	<i>f</i>) would be repetition, and so redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) wants a definition of " Commercial unit". t means an agriculturalunit which in the opinion of the appropriate Minister is capable when farmed under reasonably skilled management of providing full-time employment foran individual occupying it and for at least one other man—or full-time employment for an individual occupying it and employment for members of his family or other persons equivalent to full-time employment for one man. This is a matter on which the Ministry itself would give advice on commercial prospects. I hope that, with that information, the hon. Member will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a particular point whether the retention of (f) narrows the clause under the existing legislation so as to prevent a tribunal from going outside the precise terms of the new paragraph,

	<span class='label label-info column'>1155</span>
even though it may be very desirable to amalgamate one holding with anotherin the same ownership. It might be desirable to amalgamate a non-commercialunit with a commercial unit, or 
	<i>vice versa,</i> to make the best use of the buildings and machinery and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that if these words were left out it would weaken the landlord's rights. In our opinion they appear to do so if left in. We want clarification as to whether the Agricultural Land Tribunal would be able to deal with any desirable amalgamation under the terms of good husbandry and good estate management.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand by my claim that this would weaken and widen the special provision so as to make the grounds no different from those set out in Section 25 (1) (
	<i>b</i>)in the Agricultural Holdings Act. The question of amalgamation of two holdings to form a larger commercial holding, falls underSection 25 (1), but para. (

I still do not think he has fullyanswered the point about the question of amalgamations, that this clause does not exclude anything that is contained in the present legislation and that in fact the tribunal will be able, on the grounds of good husbandry and good estate management, to allow amalgamations of holdings to go on. That was the point I was trying to make. As far as the point made by the hon.

Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick). We have been trying, during the course of this Committee, to protect existing tenants, and we are afraid that certain tenants will not be protected because of a technical definition, with the existing holding or tenancy of the land he is farming being excluded from the consideration of the viability or not of the unit. This seeks to protect the tenant and not his successor. We do not want to see a genuine point of difficulty being lost over a technicality. I ask my hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the proposed Clause, Amendment (c), in line 21, leave out subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0634">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1157</span>
this is basically a probing amendment, because the nature of subsection (4)seems to us to be somewhat vague. The new Clause gives to the landlord an opportunity of applying to the tribunal for its consent to the operation of his notice to quit on any grounds specified in Section 25 of the 1948 Act. This notice is a notice to quit under Section 24 (2) (
	<i>g</i>)of the 1948 Act, which, apart from those provisions, is an incontestable notice and would still continue to be an incontestable notice if paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>)and(
	<i>b</i>)of new Clause 9(1) apply. There is no need or opportunity for thelandlord to apply for consent to the notice to quit except under new Clause11, where there is an application which might result in a direction entitling the applicant to a tenancy of the holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have put down this amendment to leave out subsection (4) because, as it stands, it restricts the landlord to seeking consent to the operation of the notice to quit to cases under new Clause 11. There appears to be no reason for that, as this seems to be the only time that he would need to apply for consent. We are concerned that new Clause 11 provides no procedure for the landlord applying for consent, but simply states that he must be afforded the opportunity. If the landlord were not given a reasonable opportunity for some reason and missed the opportunity afforded by the tribunal, subsection (4) would prevent him from having any other opportunity to seek consent to the notice to quit. That seems rather anomalous and we would be grateful if the Minister could explain the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to try to clarify the points the hon. Member has made with regard to subsection (4) of new Clause 11. First of all, the whole point of the new Clause 11 is to provide the opportunity for the landlord to obtain the tribunal's consent to the operation of the notice to quit. The purpose of subsection (4) is to prevent procedural difficulties which could otherwise occur. Without this provision, it would be possible for a landlord to apply for the tribunal's consent to the operation for notice to quit before the appropriate stage had been reached in any tribunal hearing, or, indeed, independently of any application to the tribunal for tenancy of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1158</span>
the holding. Subsection (4) requires the tribunal to disregard the landlord's application in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously if no one had applied to become the tenant of the holding, the landlord does not need to get the tribunal's consent to the operation of a notice to quit given by reason of the death of the tenant, and if applications are made for the tenancy and the tribunal decides that none of the applicants satisfies it as to his eligibility or suitability, the landlord will regain possession of the holding without any further action on his part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only after the tribunal has decided that an eligible applicant is suitable to become a tenant of the holding, and before it gives a direction entitling him to a tenancy, that the landlord's application for consent to the notice to quit will be heard. The purpose of subsection (4) is, therefore, to make sure that the landlord's application for consent to the operationof the notice to quit is made in the correct sequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that explanation has clarified the situation with regard to theamendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of that explanation, which we shall have to study because these are rather complicated matters, and assuming that we might have the opportunity of returning to this matter on Report when we have considered the full moment of what the Minister said I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the proposed clause Amendment (d), in line 27, insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'(6) If the landlord can show that he purchased the holding within ten years before the passing of this Act, specifically for the purpose of the holding being farmed, as an owner-occupier, after the death of the tenant, by himself or by his child, then the Tribunal shall give their consent under this section to the operation of the notice to quit'.</p></blockquote>
I regard this amendment as one of the most important we shall be debating this morning. I am glad to say at the outset that it has the support once more of the hon. Member for Durham (Mr. Hughes) whose name is attached to it.We can therefore say that there is all-party support for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying in this case to protect the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1159</span>
interests of the landlord where within the 10 year period before the passing into law of this Bill he has purchased a holding with the specific intention of farming it himself after the death of the tenant—either to farm it himself or to allow his child to farm it. We believe that, potententially, this is a very hard case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will remember, Mr. Costain, that, when we debated these matters on the Floor of the House, I drew attention to a case which had been brought to myattention by a constituent of mine who is temporarily living abroad. He wrote to me and I sent his letter to the Minister. I have had a letter back from the Minister dated 31st March. My constituent says that he owns a 90-acre tenanted farm. I feel I must read what he said in his letter although I did read it out before. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the new clause stands to create personal hardship for me in that I may not be able to reside at, and farm, the property when the present tenant, who is elderly, retires or dies. Temporarily a non-resident, I bought the farm three years ago with a view to returning from abroad and making itour family home when the present tenancy expires, and the farm now represents the bulk of my savings".</p></blockquote>
He goes on to relate some of the other details of the case. The Minister has seen the letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is a case where we ought to try to soften the cutting-edge of this provision. A man has put the bulk of his savings into a tenanted farm, imagining that the tenant would be likely to give up farming or die at about the time when he himself wished to retire. It is wrong, where somebody has set out his retirement years in this way, or made provision for his son to farm,to pass legislation which could totally upset the plans of a number of people, although perhaps not many, for their future. Immense hardship is likely to occur in these cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reply I got from the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Tribunal will therefore weigh the element of hardship in the landlord's case against the element of hardship in the case presented by the tenant's successor. I have no reason to doubt the ability of the Tribunal to use their discretion and reach a fair and reasonable decision in such a matter."</p></blockquote>
It is all very well saying that, but that is no safeguard for my constituent and a number of other people who have written to me in very similar termsover the last few weeks. There is immense hardship in these cases. This is not a case of the great landowners,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1160</span>
and if the Minister of State wants to write in an acreage provision, then so be it; l would not quarrel with that too much. We are dealing here with the smaller landlord, who has his eye on a certain holding which he has bought for a purpose. He has deployed his savings or resources into that, and it would be immensely unfair if Parliament were to pour out this legislationwithout making some effort to see that this very limited number of people have their savings and future safeguarded to some extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the all-party support that we have had for this amendment, I am hopeful that the Government will be prepared to accept it. It is essential to deal with this matter. The Government speak a great deal about hardship,and say that they are invoking these new clauses because of hardship being created. So I think they will accept, in fairness, that this type of situation would create the most tremendous hardship for a family of that kind, whose savings had been sunk into a farm and who had perhaps made heavy borrowing. We ought to protect their interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the amendment is intended to take into account the situation where someone has bought a farm so that, after the death ofthe tenant, it can be farmed by himself, by his child or by some successor,and it is felt that the tribunal should therefore give its consent to the operation of the notice to quit. I naturally sympathise with someone who bought a holding with the intention of occupying it when the present occupier either gives up farming or dies, and I agree that a close relative of an occupier who lived on the holding for less than the 10-year period specified in the amendment would find it difficult—though not impossible—to sustain before the Agricultural Land Tribunal a claim of hardship in support of his application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note, incidentally, that there is no mention of the fair and reasonable landlord test here, which I should have thought the hon. Gentleman would consider a necessary ingredient. So the tribunal is given no discretion in reaching its decision. In other words, it would not have an opportunity of making comparisons, because the amendment would take that away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary, and this may be one reason why my hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0636">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1161</span>
the Member for Durham (Mr. Hughes), who is quoted as having signed this amendment is alone among my hon. Friends in supporting it. This is a clear case of hardship, and the legislation already provides the necessary safeguards. The landlord will be able to present his case to the tribunal for its consent to the operation of the notice to quit based on Section 25(1)(d) of the 1948, Act which contains the phrase,
	<br><blockquote><p>"greater hardship would be caused by withholding than by giving consent to the operation of the notice to quit."</p></blockquote>
The tribunal will, therefore, weigh the element of hardship in the landlord's case against the element of hardship in the applicant's case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two lay members of the tribunal represent the landowning interest and the farming interest and will have their part to play, and I see no reason to doubt their ability to use their discretion and reach a fair and reasonable decision in the matter. But I do not think it desirable or justified—and I am sure my hon. Friends will agree—that their powers of discretion should be circumscribed as proposed in the amendment. I think my right hon. Friend, in his reply to the hon. Member inthe House, made it quite clear that the Tribunal will weigh the element of hardship in the landlord's case against the hardship in the case presented by the tenant's successor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am just wondering what would be the Minister's view if someone inherited a farm during the last 10 years, instead of purchasingit for the same purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a situation which has certain similarities, because a person could expect to inherit certain land, both in the present situation and when the legislation is passed, and he may well feel that he should havethe right to take over a farm. But the tribunal will have the job of assessing the greater hardship, and this will protect the interests of those concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are looking at the situation before the legislation is passed, in which some people may say " I bought this farm with a certain intention ", and inwhich the customs and traditions of succession which we are putting into the Bill have already been applying. We are only carrying in to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1162</span>
legislation what is the normal practice of good landlords. Certainly, if the legislation is passed, those people who have it in mind to acquire farms in the situation mentioned by the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling)and the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) will know what the situationis and will be aware of the fact that it is for the Agricultural Land Tribunal to consider where the greater hardship lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I feel that the amendment is unnecessary. Indeed, it goes right against the whole purpose of the succession principle which we are trying to embody in the Bill. One imagines that some people may regard this as a possible way of evading the legislation. I hope that, with that explanation, and in view of the fact that there will be no real hardship which cannot beconsidered by the Agricultural Land Tribunal, the Opposition will not presstheir amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister of State cannot have read the amendment, because he said that if it is passed there might be a temptation for people to try to evade the legislation. The amendment states that this will apply only to the 10-year period before the passing of the Act, so there can be no question of people using it to evade the law. We are merely being retrospective and trying to protect the interests of people who have put their savings into a holding over the last 10 years. These are people who havetried to plan for their future from 1967 up to the present day, and who, asa consequence of this legislation, see their whole plans being totally shattered, which is quite unreasonable. I do not think the Minister paid any attention at all to what we put down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I point out to the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) that we did not put the question of inheritance into this amendment because that is a different situation. We have only brought in the narrow point of someone who acquired a holding with a view to obtaining it in order to farm it himself, andwho made plans accordingly. We felt that the question of inheritance was a rather broader matter, and we preferred to leave it out. We are trying to deal with cases of great hardship, and the Minister of State was most unsympathetic in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the greater hardship test, I would say that the fact that a land-

	<span class='label label-info column'>1163</span>
lord had sufficient funds to invest in a farm might mean that he had greater resources than the tenant's son, but I do not think that that alters the situation. The tenant's son must always have known the position and would have had the opportunity to plan for the future. So I do not think we shall necessarily add very much to the hardship of the tenant's son, because, if the landlord can show that he purchased the holding with a view to farming it himself, that implies that he must have informed the tenant's son of hisintention.

I am grateful for the comments of the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling). Very briefly, the purpose of the clause is to set out what is to happen when the Agricultural Land Tribunal issues a direction to the effect that a suitable applicant is to become the tenant of a holding. With that almost formal moving, I will await any comments which may follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: In default of any other contributor to this debate, I should like to press the Minister for more explanation. We are entitled to some advocacy, not merely to presentation. He is like a waiter who brings the food to the table, but the head waiter explains and compliments the diner on his choice. Therefore, I look for some more on this matter. This is a complex clause and, however briefly, we are entitled to an outline of the main objectives and of the dangers and difficulties which the Minister comprehends in this situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may put myself in the role of the waiter, I was taking a hint from the customer as to the way in which the meal should be served. I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman says, and I shall go through the subsections briefly if that would be for the convenience of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) vests the new tenancy in the person or persons who are the subject of a direction by the Agricultural Land Tribunal with effect from the relevant time and under the same terms as the deceased's tenancy. The relevant time for the beginning of the new tenancy is primar-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1166</span>
ily defined in subsection (2) as 12 months from the end of the year of tenancy in which the deceased died. This is the normal period of time under theexisting legislation for ending a tenancy on death.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative definition of "relevant time" in this paragraph is requiredbecause of the possibility that a tenant may die shortly before the term date of his tenancy but the landlord may not serve notice to quit until afterthe term date. If the notice to quit expires 12 months after the time indicated in paragraph (
	<i>a</i>)of this subsection, the period of the occupancyby the executors would be cut short if it were not for this provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In subsection (2)(b) there is a reference to Section 24(2) (
	<i>g</i>)of the 1948 Act, about which I am concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that that is the present position. There is no change. t is merely clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) applies to a succession taking place in a fixed-term tenancy. Subsections (4) and (5) are procedural. Subsection (4) prevents the new tenancy being assigned without the landlord's consent. Admittedly, a landlord may well decide to include a non-assignment clause in the new tenancy agreement, but the new agreement may take some months to negotiate and the landlord's interest would be exposed in the interim period, so this subsection prevents any assignment taking place during that interim period. Subsection (5) terminates any other tenancies to the holding at the same time as thenew tenancy begins. The most obvious example is any tenancy which the deceased's executors hold by virtue of their own legal status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main purpose of subsection (6) is to exclude the provisions of new Clause
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0639">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1167</span>
13 where the landlord and the tenant have already negotiated a new tenancy agreement and/or rent. But this provision is also necessary to prevent any tenancy created by agreement between the landlord and the tenant being terminated by the provisions of subsection (5) of this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (7) is a similar subsection to subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (8) is an unusual subsection in that it enables the Lord Chancellor
	<span class='label label-info column'>1168</span>
to make regulations, subject to annulment by either House, providing for any or all of the provisions of this part of the Bill to apply in cases wherethe person to whom a direction applies dies before taking up the new tenancy.

	<p>'(1) Where the Tribunal give a direction such as is mentioned in subsection (1) of section (Effect of direction under section (Applications for tenancy of the holding)) of this Act, the provisions of this section shall apply unless excluded by subsection (6) of that section.</p>

	<p>(2) In the following provisions of this section—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the landlord" means the landlord of the holding;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the tenant" means the person or persons entitled to a tenancy pr joint tenancy of the holding by virtue of the direction;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the relevant time" has the meaning given by section (Effect of direction under s. (Applications for tenancy of the holding)) (2) of this Act;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the prescribed period" means the period between the giving of the direction and the end of the three months immediately following the relevant time.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>(3) At any time within the prescribed period the landlord or the tenant mayby notice in writing served on the tenant or landlord (as the case may be) demand a reference to 15 arbitration under the 1948 Act of one or both of the following questions, namely

	<ol>

	<li>what variations in the terms of the tenancy which the tenant is entitled to or has obtained by virtue of the direction are justifiable having regard to the circumstances of the holding and the length of time since the holding was first let on those terms;</li>

	<li>what rent should be or should have been properly payable in respect of the holding at the relevant time.</li></ol>
In the following provisions of this section those questions are referred toas "question (a)"and" question (b)" respectively—</p>

	<p>(4) On a reference under subsection (3) above the arbitrator—

	<ol>

	<li>where question (

	<ol>

	<li>shall determine what variations, if any, in the terms mentioned in that question are justifiable as there mentioned and accordingly shall with effect from the relevant time vary those terms in accordance with his determination or direct that they are to remain unchanged; and</li>

	<li>if it appears to him that by reason of any provision included in his award under sub-paragraph (i) above it is equitable that the rent of the holding should be varied, may vary the rent accordingly with effect from the relevant time;</li></ol>

	<li>where question (
	<i>b</i>)but not question (
	<i>a</i>)is so referred, shall determine what rent should be or should have been properly payable in respect of the holding at the relevant time and accordingly shall, with effect from that time, increase or reduce the rent which would otherwise be or have been payable or direct that it shall remain unchanged;</li></ol>

	<p>(6) On any reference under subsection (3) above the arbitrator may include in his award such further provisions, if any, relating to the tenancy which the tenant is entitled to or has obtained by virtue of the direction asmay be agreed between the landlord and the tenant.</p>

	<p>(7) The award of an arbitrator under this section, if made after the relevant time, shall 50 have effect as if the terms of the award were contained in an agreement in writing entered into by the landlord and the tenant and having effect as from the relevant time.</p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with the details of arbitration on a new tenancy. The provisions of this clause operate only when there has been a direction by the Agricultural Land Tribunal in accordance with subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) provides that at any time between the giving of the direction by the Agricultural Land Tribunal and the end of the first three months of the new tenancy, the landlord or the tenant may require arbitration on the terms of a new tenancy agreement and/or a fresh rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) gives alternative procedures to be followed when there is arbitration only on a new tenancy agreement or there is arbitration only on afresh rent. If the date of the arbitrator's award is before the end of the deceased's tenancy, the new tenancy shall come into effect with the new agreement and/or rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) provides that the new rent shall be on the basis of the well-known open-market rent formula which is used for all new tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (6) empowers the arbitrator to include in his award any additional terms that may be agreed between the landlord and the tenant, while subsection (7) allows the arbitrator's award to be applied with effect from thebeginning of the new tenancy should arbitration take place after the new tenant occupies his holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, under subsection (8), the various general provisions dealing with the conduct of agricultural arbitrations which are contained in Schedule 6 of the 1948 Act are made applicable to arbitration under this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is all admirably straightforward and transparently obvious in meaning.

	<p>(2) In the following provisions of this section—

	<br><blockquote><p>"an eligible applicant "means a spouse or a child or adopted child of an eligible tenant in whose case the following conditions are satisfied—

	<ol>

	<li>he has throughout a continuous period of not less than five of the previous seven years, or for two or more discontinuous periods together amountingto not less than five years during the previous seven years, derived his only or principal source of livelihood from working on an agricultural holding of the eligible tenant in respect of which an application is made under this section, and</li>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a slight amendment to the clause, which makes it in order for me to say a little more about it. The clause is an attempt to provide forthe tenant's retirement at about the age of 65 where he is to be succeeded by a close relative. The combination of taxation and the provisions of the Bill will leave the landlord—tenant relationship in danger and will have grave consequences for the future of British agriculture. The clause, albeit badly drafted and incomplete, is an attempt to rectify the balance and to improve the provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Landlords—and sons who are promised a succession to the tenancy—sometimes complain that the tenant holds on into old age so that the son is past middle age when he becomes the tenant. The Parliamentary Secretary earlier gave an assurance that he will bring forward an amendment on Report to provide that where there is family agreement between the parties there will be a succession under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause seeks to provide that after Michaelmas 1977 the succession clauses will not take effect on the death of a tenant but on a procedure which must be put in train before the tenant reaches the age of 65. In effect, that compels the tenant to retire at about 66, because the new tenancy would not start until at least a year after the application where a close relativesucceeds, unless the landlord has agreed or will agree to a later date for retirement. In other cases, the tenancy will continue until death as at present, but there will be no succession procedure under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) postpones the operation of the retirement scheme until 29th September 1977 so as not to catch on the hop tenants who reach 65 within about one year of the passing of the Bill, and to allow the provisions of theBill to be thor-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1174</span>
oughly known in the agricultural community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (2), the definition of the eligible applicant is somewhat narrower than the eligible person in new Clause 8. I am prepared to accept, asa result of the discussions we have had on the Bill, that that part of my new Clause is imperfect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By subsection (5), if the landlord does not enter into a contract of tenancy with the close relative within three months, the close relative can applyfor a direction from the ALT entitling him to a tenancy in the same way as under new Clause 10. The same criteria would apply as in new Clause 10 and the landlord would be able to defeat the application on a fair and reasonable landlord test. If the close relative succeeded in getting a direction, his new tenancy would start as from the relevant date and the existing tenancy would end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If tenants are to be required to retire, consideration will have to be given as to their accommodation. This point was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton). t may be necessary to provide that the tenant must be allowed to occupy a dwelling on the holding, if no alternative accommodation is available, during his lifetime and that of his spouse living with him, if any. This should not cause difficulty because the close relative would presumably not require new accommodation. He would eitherbe living in the farmhouse or near the farm. t would also be necessary to ensure that succession on these retirement provisions would be limited to two occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the object of the exercise. It would involve very few cases. If we are prepared to have the ALT as arbiter of hardship in the other new clasues, I do not see why, in these very few cases where
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0643">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1175</span>
the existing tenant hangs on and thereby allows the farm to run down and prevent the succession taking place, that the hardship element of making the succession in these cases should not be decided fairly by the ALT. That is the substance of my new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It became clear during the Second Reading debate on new Clause 8 that there was some kind of agreement between us that where a tenant farmer, his chosen successor and his landlord were all agreed that the tenant should retire in favour of the chosen successor, it should be permitted and should count as one succession under the family succession scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already announced our intention to provide that succession by agreement on the death of the tenant should be allowed to count as one succession. I am glad to be able to extend that provision to the case of retirement,provided that the tenant, landlord and new tenant are all agreed, and we will table the appropriate amendment on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main purpose of new Clause 16 is to deal with the problem of the elderly tenant farmer who refuses to retire, even though he may have a son who wishes to take over the tenancy and a landlord willing to accept him. This isa situation which is not unknown in the farming world. The holding eventually starts to deteriorate. It is a situation by no means unknown in the business world either, where the business also starts to deteriorate. This is ageneral and not just a farming problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic question which new Clause 16 poses is whether it would be acceptable for any elderly tenant's close relative to seek a direction from an impartial body or to make a private arrangement with the landlord to the effect that, because he is reaching the age of 65, 70, or any other age, the tenant should be deprived compulsorily of his tenancy in favour of a younger man. Such a radical reform would have wide ramifications. I do not believe it would be acceptable to the Government or to our Back Benchers. I doubt whether it would be acceptable to Parliament as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
t would create a situation where a man's tenancy of his holding could be put in jeopardy because of the compulsory retirement age which may be decided. The present situation is very much more com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1176</span>
mendable than the change which the hon. Gentleman proposes. I hope the hon.Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) will bear in mind what I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong the debate on this new Clause, but I am in two minds about it.

I agree absolutely with my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) that we are in danger of this Bill leading to bad husbandry. We ought toredress balance. I believe we will find farms remaining of the same size and not being amalgamated. We are in grave danger of not having the most efficient farming with the greatest possible production from the land, which isan important matter for this country, particularly at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As someone approaching the magic age of 65, I do not know that I would liketo be compulsorily retired.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a considerable period, there has been an extremely intense feeling throughout the agricultural industry at the unfair and unrealistic constraints placed upon it by the restrictive trade practices legislation and by the failure of successive Governments, both Conservative and Socialist to alleviate the situation or even to recognise the true extent of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
United Kingdom restrictive trade practices legislation is far more formidable than anything that exists with our European partners. It contributes significantly to a perpetuation of the very weak bargaining position of small producers or businesses 
	<i>vis-a-vis</i>buying power concentrated in fewer and fewer hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
United Kingdom legislation is very comprehensive and covers any recommendation or agreement on price, production, supply, description, persons to whomsupplied, and so on. It presumes that everything is restrictive unless it is covered by one of a few specific defences, none of which is relevant to agriculture or appropriate to smaller businesses. All agreements or recommendations have to be registered. Penalties for a failure to do so are very severe indeed. Virtually all registered agreements have to be defended before the court or, if they are not,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1180</span>
abandoned. The cost of defence is prohibitive and the chances of success are minimal, virtually non-existent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only exemptions to date are certain co-operatives, and even these have to have a sophisticated constitution, frequently unrealistic and contrary to their commercial and taxation requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are important areas of the main legislation that are inappropriate not only to agriculture but also to trade organisations and associations of smaller businesses. This is recognised in European legislation. Quite rightly, the farming industry says " if we are to be part of Europe, let us appreciate and have a full understanding of European legislation".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much collective action amongst smaller businesses is neither harmful nor against the national interest, nor of major economic significance. t is frequently advocated by Government. It can help rationalisation of production and facilitate the achievement by small businesses of economies of scale. TheEEC, therefore, exempts from certain of the Community's general rules against restrictive practices companies that have a turnover of less than 150 million units of account or cover less than 10 per cent. of the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clearly indicates what Europe regards as economically significant. Thus, companies in Europe with substantial turnovers are exempt for certain kinds of agreement, while in this country collective action of a few small businesses is statutorily assumed to be against the public interest. But our legislation goes even further. A verbal recommendation- by an officer of a trade association such as the National Farmers' Union is prohibited. There is no comparable constraint in Europe. United Kingdom trade associations are statutorily assumed to have a clause in their constitution requiring all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0646">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1181</span>
their members to do what they are told. Again, there is no similar constraint in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a much wider recognition in the legislation of other industrially-developed countries that restrictive practices legislation is totally inappropriate to, and unnecessary for, smaller businesses and their trade associations in general, and for agriculture in particular. Community regulationsgive a very wide measure of exemption to agricultural associations because they recognise their weak bargaining position vis-a-vis the large buyers, processors and freezers, and also because they recognise that collective action by groups of farmers is neither against the national interest nor of great economic significance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite apart from the European aspect, the impact of restrictive trade practices legislation is of itself grossly unfair on small businesses and their trade associations. The findings of the Bolton Committee of Inquiry into Small Firms stresses this point very forcibly. Its findings have been sympathetically understood by both major parties and, I believe, the Liberal Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In agriculture, where, of course, some 99 per cent of the farms employ 10 men or less and are therefore very small units, there have been constant Government exhortations to the industry to improve marketing, ensure steady throughput of produce, improve quality, and so on. None of this can be achieved except by collective action and recommendations. Yet this is just what the restrictive trade practices legislation prohibits and will continue to do so unless the exemptions are adequate. 1emphasise that this is the purpose of my new Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Monopolies legislation cannot be invoked unless a quarter of the market is controlled by one company, and a merger is not scrutinised unless assets of£5 million are to be taken over. Companies and mergers minimally below these limits escape the legislation because they are clearly regarded asbeing of insufficient economic significance. Yet collective action by 20 or30 farmers, the economic significance of which is trivial by comparison, isprohibited unless they have the cumbersome and sophisticated constitution laid down in the orders made under the 1962 Act. This is grossly unfair and makes no
	<span class='label label-info column'>1182</span>
kind of political or economic sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European method of a wide measure of block exemption thus has much to commend it and merits very much further consideration in this country than it has so far been given. In addition to ensuring a situation in which smallbusinesses can operate and take collective action with a clear knowledge ofwhat is within and what is outside the law, such an approach would free thetrade associations of small business industries, such as the NFU, and theirofficers and officials from unrealistic and unnecessary constraints which their counterparts on the Continent do not suffer. The NFU has never argued that agriculture should be free from all constraint. If ever there was a restrictive practice in the industry that was against the national interest it should be possible to prohibit it, but all that is necessary to deal withsuch a situation would be a residual power for the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Europe accepts to a very considerable extent that restrictive trade practices legislation is inappropriate to agriculture, and that collective arrangements in agriculture are not of sufficient economic significance to pose a threat to national interests. Failure of the United Kingdom to recognise this results in unfair competition for the British producer which neither theTreaty of Rome nor the Treaty of Accession requires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ibelieve that this Bill is absolutely the right instrument for bringing in this necessary amendment to the law which can only benefit the British farmer. The Government have brought in the succession clauses and have made this Bill the instrument for doing so. Let them now, having supported the NFU over succession, support it over restrictive trade practices and accept this new Clause, perhaps with a few minor amendments which I am prepared to accept, for there are one or two points of drafting which could be improved. If the Government accept it, they will be doing a service to British agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of priorities. I am sure that in what I say I have the support of our staff as well, and I do not think I can ask our Clerk to reconsider her position. I know that the words " ALT " are very much in our minds in this Bill. I believe our Clerk intends to add the letters " AR" for she is off to the altar in a few days' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this Committee, we have been considering the criteria for those who have succession in mind. She comes well up to the requirements of new Clause 8, which refers to eligibility; and most certainly she comes up to the criterion of suitability, which is also part of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may speak for this Committee and say something which, in another sense, might be considered a matter for the Agricultural Land Tribunal, I would think that she and her intended husband are well suited to a joint holding of their assets in the future, though whether a farm or land would be suitable is not for me to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If she were to suggest that, I would hope that for once you would ignore what she has to say. My hon. Friends and I would like to associate ourselves with what the Minister has said. I was rather surprised that he spoke of our Clerk as thinking about getting married, because this is a rather late moment for her to be changing her mind
	<span class='label label-info column'>1184</span>
or even thinking of doing so. But in view of the determination she has shown in keeping you, Mr. Costain, and the rest of us in order, I do not think her determination is in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is with great delight that we are able to do this. I do not know whetherever before in the history of the House we have had a motion of this kind. Of all the motions that the Government have moved during our deliberations,this is much the most sensible. We have not had an opportunity of meeting our Clerk's " intended ", but I am sure he is an extremely lucky man, although on reflection, considering the iron rule with which she has dealt with you, Mr. Costain, and the rest of us, I hope he knows what he is in for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We give her our very best wishes at this moment and our affection and gratitude for what she has done for us. We are delighted to know that she is to stay in the Clerk's Department. That is a rather good discipline for a wife, because, in doing their duty about the House, the Clerks learn that they cannot answer back, and that is quite a good discipline for a wife.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You may have noticed, Mr. Costain, that we have made remarkable progress this morning, principally perhaps because we understood that our Clerk was not to be with us at our future meetings, and we were therefore very keen to do our utmost to complete consideration of this Bill this morning. I hope that we may be able to continue until 1.15, but we felt that if we were to continue it might be a case of, " when the cat's away the mice will play".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thinking of that, every member of the Committee has contributed a small sumof money to give to our Clerk a small memento of our affection and gratitude to her. We have, together with the Parliamentary Clerk, Tony Woodhouse, whom we have made an honorary member of the Committee for this occasion, bought her a silver ornament with the mice on it so that she can think of how we might have played if we had had to continue without her guidance. We areglad this occasion has happened and wish her every happiness in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As there is a prospect of finishing this morning, I shall extend the sitting till 1.15 p.m. We now return to the Question, That new Clause 17 be read a Second time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot allow the harmony of the Committee tocontinue with regard to new Clause 17. It would have the effect of considerably widening the classes of association and the scope of the agreements given exemption from the restrictive trade practices legislation. It would enable agricultural associations, such as agricultural trading co-operatives,to enter into restrictive agreements relating to any matter with any other association without any obligation to register them as restrictive agreements with the Office of Fair Trading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, an agricultural federal co-operative would be able to accept restrictions on behalf of its members or make recommendations to them in respect ofthe quantity to be produced or supplied. A large federal could, under this proposal, control the supply of produce over a wide area. This would removethe safeguards incorporated in the Agricultural and Forestry Associations Order 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the intention, I am sure, is only to smooth the path of the agricultural trading co-operative, the clause as it stands would leave the consumer much too exposed. Although provision is made for agricultural Ministers to deal with any abuse, effective surveillance would only be possible if everyagreement and every recommendation were submitted for scrutiny before adoption. That, I suspect, is precisely what the proposers of this clause wish to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the evaluation of restrictive agreements is a function of the Restrictive
	<span class='label label-info column'>1186</span>
Practices Court, which was set up specially for the purpose. The examination of restrictive agreements extending beyond agriculture is not a subject appropriate to the agricultural Ministers' functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, more importantly, I am not convinced of the need for this clause. A very wide measure of exemption for agricultural associations has been provided in agricultural legislation since 1962. The Agricultural and Forestry Associations Act of that year exempted from registration agreements made by formally-constituted co-operatives and their members in connection with the marketing of members' produce and the supply of requisites to their members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then, in 1968, the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act widened the classes of co-operatives and of agreements which could benefit under the 1962 Act. The most important change made by the Agricultural and Forestry Associations Order was to extend exemption from the restrictive practices legislation to arrangements under which a number of cooperatives consisting of individual producers agreed to sell their members' produce through a second-tier co-operative —referred to in the Order as a "federal" —of which they are members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, the new order widens still further the range of agreements that are given exemption, and indeed goes as far as is possible to assist the legitimate activities of agricultural co-operatives, while preserving a proper balance between their needs and the interests of consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions made by the 1974 order are somewhat complex, and I recogniseThat they need to be tested in the light of experience. If any substantial difficulties are reported, these will be fully considered in consultation with the interests concerned, and if any changes in the existing legislationare considered to be desirable, they will be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the proposed EEC directive on producer groups could, when it appears—and this is important—involve a much more radical re-appraisal of the relevant legislation affecting agriculture associations, and it would seem good sense to wait for that. The agricultural legislation rightlyoffers exemption only to approved agricultural trading associations. The new clause would give exemption not only to agricultural associations, but toany association, perhaps without any agricul-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0649">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1187</span>
tural connections, that might come into contractual relationship with an agricultural organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1 recognise the strength of the hon. Member's feeling, but I think he will appreciate that this is a matter which goes far beyond the work already done in the preparation of this clause. t would certainly require consultationwith other Ministries, and possibly the Restrictive Practices Court and theOffice of Fair Trading and other people, and the time will come when the House will have an opportunity to make the review which the hon. Gentleman seeks. I hope that he will accept my assurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether any of my hon. Friends wish to speak in this debate, because this is an extremely important new clause. I can only repeat that the Government found it right to introduce a very important new matter into this Bill. Their excuse for doing so was that the NFU had for long been pressing them on this matter, and that there was a great deal of pressure for a change along the lines which they have suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I would say, in turn, that for many years those farming—the NFU, in particular—have pressed for a change relating to restrictive trade practices legislation. One of the reasons why the Government introduced the succession clauses into this Bill was that Parliament does not provide many opportunities for such changes. Therefore, again I put it to them that this Bill also provides an opportunity to make this very valuable change. I agree that in the light of legislation which will no doubt emanate from Brussels and other centres of European bureaucracy, further changes will be required in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel very strongly about the clause, which meets the just representations which
	<span class='label label-info column'>1188</span>
have been made to us by the farming industry as a whole and the NFU in particular. We must press the clause to a vote. I am not prepared to withdraw it. In taking this line, I appreciate that one or two improvements could be made to the drafting and no doubt, if it is accepted by the Committee, the Government could table amendments on Report or, if necessary, in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want specifically to refer to subsection (1)(a) and the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and shall be deemed never to have included".</p></blockquote>
My view is that the Government would not accept that retrospection, but by an amendment at an appropriate time those words could be struck out. Likewise, the date of the coming into force of the clause in subsection (5) (
	<i>b</i>)is inappropriate. Again, the necessary amendment could be moved on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This legislation has long been required by the farming industry. The industry is suffering from a disadvantage compared with its European partners. The Government have made one change because of pressure from the farming unions, and I hope that they will take this opportunity to make another change which will be even more widely welcomed by the industry. I hope that all hon. Members will give serious consideration to supporting the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
