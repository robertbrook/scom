	<section>

	<div class='bill'>Museum of London Bill</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Museum of London Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesday 14 January 1986 and Thursday 16 January 1986 and thereafter on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past ten o'clock.—
	<i>[Mr. Luce.]</i></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a word about the sittings motion, and the best way to do that is by moving an amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to move, to leave out "and Thursday 16 January 1986". There will have to be a consequent amendment to delete "and Thursdays" but presumably that will follow after we have dealt with the first amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason why we should proceed at this appalling speed. It is clear that the Committee's intention is not to proceed with the Bill until after the Christmas recess and so there is no reason to proceed with such haste thereafter. We all have plenty to do on Thursday, but, more importantly, a delay will give us time to investigate the workings of the museum and to let the Government change their mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have changed their mind in a very short space of time. After all, it was only this year that the Local Government Act 1985 was passed. It set out a very different proposition from that with which we are now confronted in the Bill. Section 43 of that Act wipes out democratic representation through the abolition of the GLC and, consequently, its members. On page 27, section 43(1) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and as from that date the number of members to be appointed by the Prime Minister under paragraph 
	<i>(a)</i> of that subsection shall be increased from six to twelve."</p></blockquote>
That Act was passed only a few short months ago but now legislation has been introduced that seeks to alter that and in place of the "six to twelve" it is proposed to alter the number from six to nine, in the same way that the Corporation of the City of London should have the number of its members increased from six to nine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has come about within a short space of time. It is almost as short as the time we would have to discuss the Bill were we to do it in proper depth, which would take us towards Easter of next year. There is no reason to proceed as quickly as the sittings motion proposes, for by the time we meet on 14 January the Government may well have decided to change the number. They may want to make it seven or 11. They may object to even numbers and decide that odd numbers are preferable. Two lots of nine add up to an even number and the Government may wish to alter that so that the Chairman does not have to use his casting vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that in any case it will not be long before the legislation is changed. There must be a general election during the next two years, and there seems little reason to rush through crudely measures
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
that will have to be reversed if we are to maintain democracy for the Museum of London and, in the wider context, for this country. The amendment is intended to give the Government time to rethink their position and to withdraw the Bill or change their mind about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading we were told why there was to be a change after such a short period. The Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As the House will recall, last Session the Government announced their intention to divide the GLC's share equally between the two other partners after abolition."</p></blockquote>
I could not trace that declaration but no doubt the Minister can tell us when the Government made it. The Government could not carry out their intention. The Minister continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It was not possible to make provision for those new arrangements in the Local Government Act 1985 which abolishes the GLC. This was partly because the Government wanted to make amendments to the Museum of London Act 1965 and to effect other repeals, neither of which could be done under the terms of that Act."</p></blockquote>
Later he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The position is slightly confused by the fact that the Local Government Act 1985 included interim provisions that would not take effect until after 1 April next year."—
	<i>[Official Report,</i> 21 November 1985; Vol. 87, c. 469-470.]</p></blockquote>
I am not surprised at that confusion, because this has been a very confused Government, but I do not see why they could not have included in the Local Government Act 1985 the provisions in the Bill. No doubt the Minister will explain the Government's change of mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are so confused that they need to change their mind, we should give them more time. They could have between now and January—the whole of the Christmas recess—to consider clause 1. We shall not progress very far with clause 1 because six amendments have been grouped together. If the Government listened to Opposition arguments on successive Tuesdays, and I trust that we could clarify the Government's confusion and help them to find a more lasting solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are much more fundamental reasons why we want to change the sittings motion. We have a deep objection to the measure. It digs deeper into the foundations of our democratic principles than do the museum's archeological excavations into the foundations of London. The Bill appears to be merely a measure connected with the Museum of London, but it digs deep into our democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is the first example of the Government's attitude towards elected representatives, elected local authorities, and local government and democracy. I am open to correction, but my understanding is that the Bill is the first legislation to flow from the abolition of the GLC. It was argued that the GLC was expensive and cumbersome and that we should restore local democracy to where it belonged—to the local boroughs of London. It was asked why the London boroughs should be tyranised by the large-scale GLC and why local democracy should not prevail in the local boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now several months since the Local Government Act 1985 was enacted. Yet, after several months of long consideration, and after examining their faults
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
and confusions, the Government still came back with the same proposition. They said that the purpose of abolishing the GLC was to provide local democracy, but their first act is to wipe out local democracy. It happened to be the Museum of London, but it might have been bigger things. This is the first example. Instead of giving local democracy back to the local boroughs, they have stripped them of power and control, and stripped away any democratic representation in the operation of the museum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the crucial aspect. There is a new Minister who is rapidly finding his feet in the Department. Now that such a cavern of possibilities has opened in front of him, he should be given time to move around more carefully before plunging into the antidemocratic abyss with which he has been saddled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should have time to reflect during the recess before tentatively bringing in new proposals in January. Let us provide time to see how democracy can be restored. I stress this point because this is the first example we have seen of the carrying out of the Government's policy since they abolished local democracy throughout great stretches of England and within London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason for further consideration is that many consequences follow from this measure. The general principle of the Bill is to share the governorship not with local or neighbouring boroughs but with the Corporation of the City of London. That is a very curious body. I hope that hon. Members will have an opportunity to consider some statistics involved in the Corporation which need a lot of research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Replacing the democracy of the GLC, half the governors will be either elected or nominated by a council—I do not know how democracy in the City of London operates. The Corporation will be elected by 4,600 residents, as against 10,330 non-residents. We found on Second Reading that half the governors of the Museum of London would come from a body which is elected in proportion of more than two to one by non-residents of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You are long in the tooth, Sir Anthony, as I am now becoming—I mean metaphorically. One of the great planks of British democracy has been the principle of one man, one vote. As British democracy matured, it was said that it was intolerable that people who were not even resident but who were involved financially in an area should receive a vote, and that the business vote should be wiped out. But in the City of London, where there is even more money, the business vote remains. Among the electors of the Corporation, 4,600 are residents and the staggering figure of 10,330 are non-residents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is intolerable. It is a problem that goes much deeper than mere technicalities. It is our first example, since the abolition of local authorities throughout the country, that the Government do not intend to use this opportunity to strengthen local government, but almost contemptuously to flout democracy by having governorship composed only of members nominated by the Government—the very Government that is destroying democracy—and the other half directly from the Corporation of the City of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
sion that sat from 1957 to 1960 and provided the basis for the London Government Act 1963, which set up the GLC? It said that logic had its limits, and for these purposes the City lay outside them. Does not that emphasise my hon. Friend's point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before we go any further, I remind the Committee that we are discussing whether the Committee will sit on Thursdays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Were it not for the fact that I have been reminded that we are discussing that proposition, I would certainly have recalled the words quoted by my hon. Friend, for which I thank him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the present board of governors come from different bodies. Some are appointed by the Prime Minister, some by the Corporation of the City of London and others by the Greater London Council, including people such as Sir Ashley Bramall and John Gorman, whom I know well. It seems incredible that a person such as John Gorman should be removed from such a post.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among appointees of the Corporation of the City of London, we see the proliferation of honours: for example, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Colin Cole, KCVO, TD, BCL, MA, FSA. That contrasts with the straightforward man-in-the-street approach of GLC appointments: for example, Louis W Bondy, Esq. We are proud of that Esquire, rather than of the proliferation of titles among those from the purple ranks of the City of Westminster's various anks—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Stevens
	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Fulham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful to the hon. Gentleman to remember that Esquire is a title; so is Mister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are proud of that title, but we question the proliferation of titles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I caution my hon. Friend not to go too far down that path? One of the other nominees—no doubt my hon. Friend is looking at the same page of "Who's Who" as I am—is Willie Bell, who is a Conservative member of the GLC. Apart from—apparently—owning half of New Jersey, he has a considerable number of handles to his name, and we put him on the board. We do not believe that, in appointing governors, we should apply the Prime Minister's dictum of, "Is he one of ours?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is all very interesting. I am grateful to the hon. Member for reminding the Committee that we must stick to the question whether the Committee meets on Thursdays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, as always, Sir Anthony, but with respect, my hon. Friend has underlined my point. The name he has mentioned was not on the list of names that I received from the Library. In other words, there have been changes; and if we are to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays amid continual changes, it will be difficult to come to any conclusions. If there is a reason for us to take up time in the Spring, into the season of daffodils, it is this kind of change. So I thank my hon. Friend for underlining my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish now to discuss the choice of amendments in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
relation to the sittings motion. The selection confronting us—I recognise that it is entirely a matter for the Chair—has included the five amendments to clause 1 in a single major debate. That debate, which proposes three different solutions to the problem of how to bring back democracy, will certainly need a great deal of time. There are bound to be changes of thought in the course of such a discussion because it had been our intention to propose some of the amendments as alternatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, we could first have debated one amendment that proposed sticking to the present constitution of the board, since after the next election— which will not be too far off—we shall start to restore democracy. We could then have dealt with the other amendments as alternative solutions on successive weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we meet only on Tuesdays, we shall have time during the long debate in which the Government can change their mind, either by giving way on certain amendments to restore the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason for haste and every reason for thought. Such time would be in the interest of the Government, who have already admitted to confusion and have brought in a Bill in the same year as the Local Government Act 1985 was passed. Three or four months remain before democracy is stripped away from the GLC and the people of London. We want time for the new Minister to exercise his authority and say to the Government, "This will not do. I am not prepared to be the Minister to bring through the first legislation since the abolition of the GLC; it underlines the anti-democratic practice and theory of this Government".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support the wish of my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) to delete Thursday from next year's Committee timetable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case is strengthened by the fact that we are not intending to meet this Thursday. The House has decided—rightly in my view—that Committees should be in charge of their own timetables. That is the present position, at least. The timetabling of Committees is, of course, a current topic of conversation, because of the Select Committee report on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Timetable control by Committee is important. This morning we can choose whether to meet on one or two mornings a week after Christmas. Our choice, and any variation to it that we make after Christmas, is important. I served on the Committee considering the Water Bill way back in 1973-74. It got into such a tangle that it had to adjourn. Indeed, the Chairman found it necessary to be released from his job, and another Chairman was appointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that we shall get into similar tangles on this Bill—certainly not under your chairmanship, Sir Anthony—but my experience illustrates the importance of a Committee choosing its own timetable.

All hon. Members have other duties. I see several hon. Members looking at their post. No doubt the Minister has other duties in his own Department. The Bill is not long, although it is important. I suggest that to meet only once a week would be for the convenience of all hon. Members on the Committee, at least for the time being. If the Government found that, for some important reason, they needed to speed up the Bill, we could, perhaps, sacrifice our convenience and meet twice a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A certain Committee that meets to discuss important Private Bills does so only once a week by contention; that is, unless that Committee decides to go open-ended, which I hope will not be our fate, Why should we accede to the Government request to meet more than once a week when Private Members' Bills are limited to that? What urgency is there about the Bill that requires us to meet twice a week when Private Members' Bills can only be discussed once? What is the reason for this Crown request? Why do we need to hurry the Bill through?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is great offence in the Bill, as my hon. Friend said. If the Crown's representative said that he was going to abolish the shire hall in Winchester, or in Somerset or in any country represented by Conservative Members, their indignation would be as great as ours today. I am sure that their indignation about being asked to meet twice a week instead of once is also as great as ours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members would be indignant if shire hall, Winchester, were to be abolished, especially if they were trustees of an important museum. If a Minister said that he was going to remove the City Corporation, Conservative Members' wishes not to meet twice a week would be even greater, even though the City Corporation is not democratically elected or accountable to anyone except the denizens of the offices and other senior people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further reason why we should meet after Christmas and for only one day a week. Events in the City are moving, and relevant legislation may come before the House. We have heard about deregulation of the City. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) has made some surprising comments, but he is now found to be not far off the mark after all. I suggest that, in the months after Christmas, events in the City and about the City may come to such a pass that even the Government may have second thoughts about giving the City Corporation responsibility for appointing trustees to the all-London museum. The museum is concerned with the living past of all the people of London—the workers in the docks and in transport—not just of the City. In view of events in the City, is it a proper body to appoint such trustees? The Government may have second thoughts. If we meet only once a week, events may unfold and persuade the Government to reach that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The City is no longer involved in production. It may have proudly named guilds which used to produce goods, but they do not produce much now. Many of those who comprise the Corporation live outside even the Greater London area. Perhaps we should find out how many do to ensure that the Corporation is a proper body to appoint trustees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In financial terms the trusteeship of the City is less secure, and that fact may influence the Government's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
attitude to the Bill, to the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) and to other amendments that we wish to table in the light of current events. If we meet once a week we shall have more opportunity to table pertinent amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill and the reasons behind it reflect patronage, autocracy and the influence of people of finance over the rights of the citizenry to an individual vote. Prior to 1066, the City and the Crown moved warily round each other, and ever since they have been the twin pillars of patronage, autocracy, and fixing behind the scenes. I suggest that, this being the House of Commons, all Members have a joint responsibility to ensure that the unreasonable entreaties of the Crown, even though they come in the unlikely and gentlemanly guise of the hon. Member for Shoreham (Mr. Luce), the Minister here today, are looked at with great suspicion and care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have outlined the reasons why it would be the personal convenience of the Minister and of every member of the Committee to meet only on Tuesdays after Christmas. I have suggested that members' indignation could be best expressed by voting against the sittings motion, or by a similar Bill proposing that the City of London be abolished. I have also suggested that the City might not be the right body to appoint trustees. We need more time to consider the Bill but we should meet only once a week. I support the motion moved so ably by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too, was hoping that a Conservative Member would support us, but perhaps I am over-optimistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) I wish to speak to the amendment that seeks to delete "and Thursdays" from the sittings motion. I have a personal reason for wanting to do so. I am a member of Standing Committee A which is considering the Local Government Bill. That Committeee will also be sitting throughout January and it will be extremely difficult for me to be present at both Committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With Respect, my hon. Friend's present post means that his reasons for supporting my amendment are not purely personal. It is vital to the Committee that he should be here because as the leading representative of the GLC, which is under attack in the Bill, he should be present if that is possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is too kind. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> That remark at least managed to flush out the Conservative members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am chairman of the Greater London council. That gives me much additional work, although one cannot argue that I have been forced into that post, so I shall not enter that as a special plea in supporting my hon. Friend's amendment to the sittings motion. However, I hope that I can bring a little GLC dimension to our proceedings, although I am by no means the best qualified person to do so. Many others at County hall are better qualified than I am to speak on the subject but, regretably, they are not Members of Parliament.
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Many will become Members of this House after the next general election. I look forward to the reconstruction of the GLC Labour group on the Floor of the House. Having driven them from one home it seems that they are all coming over the bridge. I am merely the forerunner of what is to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I can assist the Committee with the little expertise that I have gleaned in the nearly 16 years that I have been a member of the GLC, I shall gladly put that knowledge and expertise at the Committee's disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to stretch a point and say how pleased I am to see the Minister in his place today. Although we have great differences in political approach to the arts and in many other respects, at least his presence in the House gives an added dimension to Question Time and to debates on the arts. On Second Reading we raised many points in some ways tangential to the Bill but relevant in that the Museum of London is part of the arts and culture that the GLC has funded. We had a wide-ranging discourse on the arts and the Minister's presence ensured that the debate was much more important and relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Dicks 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hayes and Harlington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, as the hon. Gentleman has explained most matters to us, he will explain why not so long ago the GLC's committees managed to get through a record number of items in one sitting. The members sought to process business to ensure that actions were taken, allegedly on behalf of the people of London, which should not have been taken at all. They took minutes to process literally hundreds of documents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not sure whether the answer to that question will be relevant to the motion. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would stick to the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Sir Anthony, I must always be guided by you. The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Dicks) is well known to be very provocative in most of his statements and interventions. No doubt I shall be able to answer that point on a future occasion. I shall merely say that the sentence of death tends to concentrate the mind wonderfully. That might be the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the Minister here in the Committee, we should be given a greater volume of more valuable answers to our questions. That is another reason for taking our time with the Bill. We do not want to drag out the proceedings or filibuster. We accept that the Bill in principle is one that we shall have to go along with, as we cannot just abandon the Museum of London. Something must be done following the abolition of the GLC, but we feel that this is not the best way of looking after the Museum. That is why we want to take our time, to be deliberative, to examine the Bill in detail and not be rushed into any hasty judgments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a great pleasure to see the sittings motion, even in its unamended form. It is considerably more agreeable than the pressures of the timetable that we face next door on the Local Government Bill. This is a more cerebral Committee that will be able to produce some good legislation, and it is not the sort of kangaroo court that exists in Committee Room 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motion, as we seek to amend it, would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0493">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
give us more chance to scrutinise the Bill. As a Member of the House I accept that the Government have a right to secure their business. That is why they are elected and what they intend to do. Equally, as the Opposition, it is our right to oppose the Bill—I hope in a constructive fashion—which is what we shall do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the fifth Committee stage of a Bill which I have attended, mainly because the House is interfering more and more in the affairs of local government. If it were not for that, I should have sat on only one of those Committees. I suspect that I shall be sitting on many more as the Government interfere more and more in the internal affairs of democratically elected councils around the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience may not be as vast as yours, Sir Anthony, but it is relevant on this occasion. The Opposition are now left with the task of examining the fine details. I cannot believe that Conservative Members are completely happy and content with the Bill as it stands. They all look busy and industrious, but I am sure that none of them are examining the Bill. They are probably all doing their constituency work, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) said. Indeed, if it is in order to say so, they may be writing Christmas cards to constituents and building up very good reputations as earnest, diligent constituency Members. I accept that writing Christmas cards to constituents is an important task for a Member of Parliament, but so is scrutinising a Bill's provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a further reason why Conservative Members should support our amendment? At election times, they always complain about the amount of legislation. Now, in office, they have introduced vast Bills to change local Government, and have followed that with a Bill of six clauses just to put new trustees in charge of the Museum of London, rotten as that idea is. So if the Government are really concerned about their legislation, let them give the Committee one meeting a week, which will enable them to ensure that the Bill is properly written and scrutinised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I know that the Conservative party is always talking about the great weight of legislation, which is, of course, its legislation. We are dealing with its programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is consequential to the Local Government Act 1985, which abolished the Greater London Council and the metropolitan country councils. We all know that if that Act had not gone through Parliament, we should not be sitting here today considering a Bill that picks up one of the consequences of abolition. That abolition was an act of vindictiveness, as well as an Act of Parliament. It will long be regretted by the people of London and, I think, by the Conservative Party, as they reap the whirlwind at the next borough council elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It it now up to us, the Opposition, to scrutinise Bills in fine detail. That is an important function, and at times we should like to see a little support from Conservative Members, who must be concerned about the quality of the legislation that they are a party to steering towards the statute book. To leave the job entirely to Opposition Members is highly undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Meanwhile, Conservative Members of the Committee have a chance to catch up with their constituency mail. No doubt those in marginal seats will welcome the opportunity of coming out smelling sweet, appearing to be good constituency MPs, so that everyone will think that their MPs are hard-working people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What their constituents will now know is that such Conservative Members, by sitting and writing letters when they should have been examining the Bill, will, perhaps, be allowing bad law to be made. While not a major Bill, it is still an important one. If it were not, the Government would not have introduced it and the Minister would not be here today enjoying my speech. He would be doing something else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a short but nevertheless important Bill. As Opposition Members have to scrutinise it, perhaps we should have a greater right to examine trie timetable and try to get one that suits us, because the responsibility for scrutiny is largely ours. Thus, although we do not have the legions on our side, Sir Anthony, you will, perhaps, weight our vote when it is taken and decide that what we lack in quantity we make up for in quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are optimists and it is Christmas. I am thinking of my Christmas card list, which, as I am now chairman of the GLC, is considerably larger than last year's. I am sure, Sir Anthony, that I can find a place on that list for you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many things to examine in the Bill. My hon. Friends have mentioned the board of governors, which is important because it influences the nature and philosophy of the Museum. It might be in the interests of the Committee to meet the board of governors. If we tie ourselves up in Committee it will be more difficult to get out and do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that the Minister has suggested that we visit the Museum of London. That is a welcome initiative on his part. I believe that the visit is today. I regret that I shall be unable to go on it because I shall be serving on the Local Government Bill Committee but I should like an opportunity to go later. However, it will be more difficult for me to go if we have afternoon sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Hanley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond and Barnes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he has not visited this important museum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is hardly worthy of the hon. Gentleman. He knows me better than that. I have visited the museum several times, though not as often as I should like. When I became chairman of the arts and recreation committee, I discovered that although I had more opportunity to go to places of interest I went to fewer of them because I was too busy taking decisions affecting them. That discovery is relevant to the Committee because the quality of decision may suffer when the personal experience element declines. I have probably been to the museum on more occasions than the hon. Gentleman. I should be glad to take him round to show him that I am familiar with the museum and its work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to go round the museum in the company of the Conservative members of the Com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
mittee. I could point out to them some of the things that the museum does not do as well as those things which it does excellently, if I may put it that way. If the Committee has afternoon sittings and I am tied up with the Local Government Bill Committee our visit will be more difficult to arrange. I am sure that I can get time off from the Local Government Bill Committee to take Conservative Members round the museum, providing that they are not caught up in afternoon sittings on this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of who its members are, their personalities and their walks of life, the board of governers has a strong influence on the museum. We shall discuss that factor later. It is because I believe that we should meet the members of the board that we should pass the amendment to the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) said, without straying into the Chairman's prerogative, that although our amendments have been selected in a block, they represent options. We should like to discuss the amendments individually so we shall be popping up and down more frequently than we should have done had the selection of amendments been different. We need longer to be briefed and to become acquainted with the relevant facts so that we can impart that knowledge for the benefit of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also spend more time over the financial provisions for the museum. The Minister wrote to me about a point that I raised on Second Reading. His letter contains a further point of some substance, to which I shall refer later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is often said in debating sittings motions, "If you need more time, surely more sittings will provide it". On the surface that is an attractive argument but we need time with sufficient flexibility. Time can come in a great rush and put hon. Members under enormous pressure. It is largely left to the Opposition to scrutinise legislation, and sometimes we cannot do so as constructively and efficiently as we should wish. The Opposition have argued for more time but we do not want it compressed. To do justice to the Bill we want the time spaced out so that we can do our homework, be assiduous as Opposition Members, and scrutinise the Bill in a constructive and fair-minded fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned the role of the City, which will be crucial to the Bill. There may be times in future, Sir Anthony, when you may think that we are wandering slightly out of order by examining the democratic structure of the City, but if we find ourselves in difficulty we shall put the point to you, Sir Anthony, that the democratic structure of the City is crucial to the philosophy of the museum. It will come as no great surprise to you to learn that the Opposition are opposed to the continuance of the City within the structure of democratic local government in London. The Herbert commission said that the City lay outside the bounds of logic in terms of local government. It certainly does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The City has an ability to survive which I wish that the GLC had been able to emulate. Politics is like a wheel: one is at the bottom at one moment, then half way up, then on top, and then going down again. We shall bide our time, but we want to discuss the City's structure in depth because that will reflect the quality and outlook of its appointees and, therefore, the quality, outlook and philosophy of the museum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
The history of the City of London goes back many hundreds of years. I am not suggesting that our timetable should stretch over such a span. It would be a little wilful to suggest hundreds of years, but because we shall be dealing with ancient institutions with such rich historical traditions, which are reflected in much of the museum's work, we shall want more time for some Members to familiarise themselves with the way that the City works. That is another reason for having a more leisurely timetable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr.Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is reinforcing my argument. Has he noticed that clause 2(5) points out that the Museum of London Act 1965 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this section 'London' includes all Greater London and the surrounding region."</p></blockquote>
The paradox of the emphasis on the City Corporation is made that much greater by the words in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I recognised that fact. I do not want to be ruled out of order for straying too far from the one square mile within which the museum lies into the Greater London area, but I have a letter from the inister that says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You asked in that debate about the definition of the region surrounding Greater London, to which clause 4(3) for example refers: That region is not precisely defined, but the Bill is drafted so as to allow the Museum's interests and the Commission's funding to extend to areas just beyond the boundary of Greater London."</p></blockquote>
That means that the scope of the Bill is far wider than appears at first reading, or indeed at second reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need more time to consider the Bill. We do not need periods of time compacted together so that we miss points. We are left with the responsibility of examining the fine print while Conservative Members resume their task of writing to constituents pointing out why they should be re-elected at the impending general election. For many of them that possibility is diminishing rapidly because of the abolition of the Greater London Council, an act which will not be forgotten by the electors of London. London Members of Parliament will no doubt suffer the consequences at the general election. Much though I admire what some Conservative Members have said, Parliament may be doing without their services after the next general election, not because of any lack of quality on their part but because of the abolition of the GLC, which some of them supported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill arises out of the abolition of the GLC. That is why we are discussing it today and why I am speaking to the amendment to the sittings motion. The Bill has profound implications for the City of London and for Greater London and sufficient flexibility should be built into the timetable to ensure that we get the legislation right the first time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have found in Committees on other Bills that Ministers often give verbal assurances about their intent in answer to questions. Obviously it was accepted at the time that the Minister's intentions were as he described, but we cannot write intent into a Bill. The wording has to be precise. We all pass on, even Ministers. The Minister has passed on here from something else, and perhaps if he makes a success of this job he will pass on again. Unfortunately, Governments do not see the arts as being as important as other areas of Government activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'> This Government do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, this Government do not. However, Previous Labour Governments have perhaps not given the arts the same emphasis that I know the next Labour Government, with the present Leader of the Opposition as Prime Minister, will give them. No doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) will make a distinguished and illustrious Minister for the Arts, but that is in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may give assurances during the course of the Bill, and we shall have to accept them because we accept that he is an honourable person. However, the Bill may be interpreted by his successor or by a court of law, in the event of a challenge. We all know that judges are not able to refer to 
	<i>Hansard</i> to find what was in the mind of the Minister of the day. The GLC found out the truth of that when our "Fares Fair" policy—to fares in order to attract people to the the buses and tubes—was found to be unlawful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider what happened when the Transport Bill of 1969, under a previous Labour Government, was being considered. Perhaps hon. Members took assurances from the Minister, who I believe was Barbara Castle, that it was possible for the GLC to have a "Fares Fair" policy, but, as it was not written into the Bill, Mr. Justice Denning was able to say that it was unlawful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want the same thing to happen with this Bill. Although I do not suppose that it will ever become the centre of controversy that the Transport Act 1969 became, following the election of the GLC in 1981, we must still be sure that we have got it right the first time. That means that we must scrutinise it in detail, and have the time to do that. I can see by the singular absence of interventions by Conservative Members that they will sit there and keep their heads down during the course of the Bill. Unfortunately, Conservative Members of Parliament do that all too often in Committees, which perhaps explains why there is so much bad legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to take our role as the Opposition very seriously. We do not wish to filibuster or drag matters out for the sake of it. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is not fair for Conservative Members to laugh. I have done my best to stay in order and to make my points pertinent to the amendment. We genuinely want to ensure that the Bill is as good as we could make it. We do not want it to go through because it is clearly consequential on something else that we like even less, but we accept that the Government will get their business through. We can only ensure that, however wrong-headed the business might be in its intent, we have eliminated some more obvious mistakes from the fine print.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the end we are all responsible for ensuring that as little interpretation can be laid on legislation as possible. I do not believe in government by judges. I believe in government by Parliament, which means that we should at all times try to get it right the first time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even Opposition Members are not infallible, but if we are to take our job seriously, we have a good case for asking for more time. We do not want to be pressurised; we want to look at the Bill in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) made a lot of remarks about the failure of Conservative Members to take part in our proceedings.

I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it would be in the Committee's interest to have visits to the museum. I use the plural because, knowing the variety of schedules in hon. Members' diaries, it will be hard to get us all to go together. Of course, we are free to go when we like, individually, but it would be better if we went when the director and senior staff were there.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have such overwhelming support from hon. Members. I shall leave it to my hon. Friend the Minister to say what arrangements can be made for us. It is clear from the enthusiastic response that I have received for my modest little proposal that the Committee support my view that we ought to keep close to the knitting, as the Americans say. The knitting in this case happens not here but in the Barbican.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Sir D. Price), who made an interesting contribution to the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I—and, I am sure, other members of the Committee—had never thought of him as a butterfly before. His contributions to debates on the arts are always thoughtful and interesting, and I look forward to more contributions from him and his hon. Friends during our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that the hon. Gentleman made about the sittings motion—his suggestion that we meet in the Museum of London—has given us all something to think about. If it is outside the Standing Orders at present, the Select Committee on Procedure should look into the matter. Sitting in the context that they are debating would improve and concentrate the minds of Members of many Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You did not give a ruling, Sir Anthony, when an hon. Member asked for one of our sittings to adjourn to the Museum itself. I wonder whether that is covered by the same sort of Standing Order that prevents us from formally meeting there. If we went to the museum, would we be going formally as a Committee, or only after the Committee has adjourned here?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Eastleigh (Sir D. Price) was perfectly in order to make his suggestion, but the Committee may not hold a session formally in the Museum of London. There is nothing to prevent Members of the Committee from going there, and if they all go together, the Committee will have gone there, but the Committee will not have held a formal session in the Museum of London. It may hold formal sessions only here in the Palace of Westminster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for your ruling, Sir Anthony. If the sittings motion is passed and we decide to sit on Thursdays, I hope that all hon. Members will support a move to adjourn the Committee on a Thursday, so that we all can assemble here at 10.30 am and go on to the museum by eleven o'clock. I hope that the hon. Member for Eastleigh will support such a move. His suggestion was genuinely constructive and would help all Committee Members to get to the museum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and his Parliamentary Private Secretary have been helpful and courteous in suggesting that they arrange a visit for us. However, I believe that the Minister is having difficulty in co-ordinating a visit of large numbers of hon. Members, because the time suggested—5.30 pm, I think—is often one that clashes with other meetings and commitments in the House. If we adjourned on a Thursday, we would thus surmount the problem being encountered by the Parliamentary Private Secretary. I put forward the suggestion, not in a mischievous or partisan spirit,
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
but in a genuine spirit of helpfulness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Due to their interest in the sittings motion, the hon. Friends have omitted to welcome you, Sir Anthony, to the Chair. I speak for all hon. Members when I say that it is nice to have a Chairman who has a personal and well-established interest in the subject matter of a Committee. We shall all welcome that interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether or not the sittings motion is passed, with or without our amendments, I—and, I hope, my hon. Friends—intend our criticisms to be constructive. There is much in the Bill to criticise, and my hon. Friends have already gone over some of the areas that need criticism. In that spirit, I welcome much of the Minister's thinking that is evident in the sittings motion. It makes good sense. It would be particularly constructive if the Committee did not sit before Christmas. I am looking forward to hearing the reason for the Minister's original suggestion that, if the motion is passed today, we should not meet for a further five weeks. That is an unusual way for a Committee to proceed. I am curious about what is in the Minister's mind. Is it solely a parliamentary version of mince pies and Christmas spirit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Palace of Westminster is a strange place. One hon. Member referred to cupboards in the museum but Westminster also has cupboards and wainscotings from whence things emerge. I believe that the suggestion that we should meet today and then not until after Christmas emerged from the wainscoting. It was probably endorsed when hon. Members on both sides of the Committee said "This is good seep-through. Perhaps we should agree on it." The agreement apparently happened mutually, helpfully and wainscotingwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that explanation. I wonder whether it coincides with that of the Minister. "Usual channels" have been described in various ways but I have never heard of "usual wainscoting" before. Be it through wainscotings, usual channels or arrases, a seasonable and attractive suggestion has emerged. It reflects well on the Minister and on his civilised approach to our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several reasons have been suggested for not holding further sittings before Christmas—for example, lack of time and the pressure of sending Christmas cards to constituents and friends. I have not begun to buy even my Christmas presents. I fear that those reasons may appear irrelevant to the Committee's sittings but Christmas presents and cards can both be very much related to the arts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that this year the House of Commons Christmas card bears an original watercolour by Sir Hugh Casson. I am a great admirer of Sir Hugh's work, though this is not one of his better drawings. The dwarf-like proportions of St. Margarets are exceptionally inept but Sir Hugh is a distinguished artist who has given a great deal to the Royal College of Art and to British art. It is an attractive card. As hon. Members have to send such a tremendous number of cards to constituents, it is good that they have an original illustration on their cards, although it is perhaps not the most notable example of that artist's work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
West (Mr. Banks) talked about his commitment as chairman of the GLC. When you receive the Christmas card that my hon. Friend promised you, Sir Anthony, you will see that it carries a very fine work by Walter Crane. Inside is a note to ensure that hon. Members on both sides of the House recognise that he was a Socialist artist. The quality of the card is very high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When hon. Members choose Christmas presents they have plenty of opportunity to buy works of art currently in the shops. The Minister can confer patronage to the arts, and especially to poetry, through his Department and through Arts Council bursaries and fellowships. Poetry is enjoying a renaissance in this country. The works of poetry available as Christmas presents in the shops will make good use of the time that the Minister suggests that we provide for ourselves by not meeting before Christmas I trust that all hon. Members will use the part of the sittings motion that provides for no sittings before Christmas not only to indulge in the wider aspects of the festive time but to ensure that their present buying and card writing has an artistic element, and to increase their education and concern for the arts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may also be a serious reason behind the Minister's suggestion that we should not meet before Christmas. He is a new Minister in the Department and must have a great many demands on his time. He must be inundated with requests from regional arts associations and bodies funded by the Arts Council to visit them and acquaint himself with their works. His responsibility in fulfilling those invitations must be onerous. I suspect that he wants a clear run between now and Christmas, not so that he can deal with his cards and presents but for getting out into the regions and making contact with those administering and creating arts and to talk to arts audiences in the regions. If that is so, we shall encourage him to use the time before Christmas in that way rather than sitting this Thursday and the following Tuesday and Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister visits the regions he will see the grave damage and potential damage to the arts. When talking to non-party political administrators and audiences he will hear their grave reservations about the trends that the Government's policy for the arts have taken during the past five years. That is a serious and laudable reason for the Minister to visit the regions, and he has the Opposition's blessing. Any sittings motion tabled by the Minister is for his convenience. If his reason for doing so is to have time in the regions, it has our support. Tabling an amendment to the sittings motion does not mean that we are criticising the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the sitting motion suggests that we should meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays. On the one hand, the Government are saying that we do not need to meet for five weeks, and on the other they say that after Christmas we should meet every Tuesday and Thursday. There appears to be no logic in that. The Minister has an extremely logical and rational mind and he will be hard put to say why we should start so slowly and with such relaxation and then make
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
up the time by sitting every Tuesday and Thursday. If we took a fairly leisurely approach from the start there would be no reason not to adopt the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) and meet only on Tuesdays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suggest that the Committee should sit only on Tuesdays, not only for the reasons given by my hon. Friend, but as an extension of the Minister's serious political reason for not meeting again before Christmas which is to give him an opportunity to play himself into his brief and meet the many diverse organisations around the country. Unlike many other ministers where concern is concentrated on large organsisations, nationalised bodies and corporate entities, the work of the Minister's Department takes place in a variety of small and often poorly funded organisations, so the Minister's responsibility to see the full range of activity is much more onerous than for many of his colleagues. If the Opposition's amendment to the sitting motion were carried and the Minister used the Thursdays early in the new year to get out into the regions, he would learn a lot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the fact that he is a Minister, but his background is in the diplomatic service. Because his predecessor was not tied up in Committee and in responsibilities to the House, he was active in getting out to the regions. During the past three years Labour Members have often criticised the appointment of Lord Gowrie, because he was not accountable to this House, but the converse—and good—side was that he was free to get out into the regions. No one could say that he was not an extremely hard-working, if hugely misguided, Minister. He also has an interest and background in the arts, as the director of an auction house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the present Minister has the added responsibilities of his duties in the House, he will find out that it is more difficult to get out and see all the constituent parts and bodies funded by the Arts Council. If our amendment to the sittings motion is not accepted, he will be tied to the Committee two mornings a week, which would make it difficult for him to see the arts in Scotland or north Wales. He would have to do so at the weekend or on Friday as it would be difficult to fit in a long distance trip on a Monday or Wednesday in between his commitments here on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I am sure that there are many funded bodies and many audiences in the further regions of the United Kingdom who would like to see the Minister, or to see more of him, and who feel that he should understand at first hand what they are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden of "The Glory of the Garden" was to extend the regional dimension. Many of us feel that the policy of concentrating activity on the centres of excellence in the regions was wrong and that there should be a greater diversity outside those essentially regional capitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"The Glory of the Garden" had a good reception by the press, but there is a growing understanding that there are serious flaws in it. If we release the Minister from duties in Committee on Thursdays, he will be able to go and listen to the very real fears about the wrong form of a good policy of decentralisation. That would be constructive, but he could do that only by visiting the regions. He might well reply that the chief administrators of the regional arts associations can meet him here, that his door is always open, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
that he is actively pursuing education for himself and consultation with regional arts associations, artists and funding bodies. We welcome and indeed expect that from a Minister with his reputation for open-mindedness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is no substitute for visiting the regions and seeing them for himself. Unless our amendment is carried, a real difficulty would arise. I would like to invite the Minister to Stoke-on-Trent to see the work that his Department is doing in financing the Victoria theatre, and to see the museum there, as he would learn interesting information which might even change his attitude to the Bill. He would see a local government involvement in our art gallery and museum, in the Gladstone pottery museum and the Chatterley Whitfield mining museum, all of which are dependent on a strong local authority input which will be lost if the Bill is passed in its present form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The knowledge, understanding and empathy of locally appointed governors on those museums has provided the individual flavour and appeal which makes them popular. The Hanley art gallery museum and the Gladstone pottery museum have been museums of the year in two of the last three years because of that local element. No amount of delegations to the Minister in the time when he is not in committee could possibly explain that. Only by using his Thursdays in the new year to go to the regions and see the work being done can he understand it. The Black Country museum in the constituency of the hon. Member for Dudley, West (Dr. Blackburn) is another classic example of a museum rooted in the history as well as the present lifestyle and industrial aspirations of a community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. John C. Blackburn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have read the speech that I made on Second Reading, which has a great bearing on the points that he has raised. I agree with his comments, but I direct the Minister's attention to the fact that if that is to be a plank for the argument in support of the sittings motion, I add this rider. I have visited the Victoria theatre. We must be scrupulously honest and pay a warm and generous tribute to the former Minister for the outstanding work that has been done at Dudley castle, Stafford castle and Montgomery castle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that point. The Victoria theatre would not be being rebuilt were it not for Arts Council support during Lord Gowrie's office. Everyone in Stoke-on-Trent welcomes that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stoke-on-Trent and the Black Country museum are places that the Minister could visit on a Wednesday because they entail short visits. He may be able to fit them in while adhering to the present sittings motion. But there are many interesting places, perhaps slightly less accessible, in Somerset, in the Somerton, Frome, Taunton and Bridgwater areas. I commend Bridgwater as an example of an arts centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not a word about arts centres in "The Glory of the Garden". If we released the Minister from his responsibilities in the Committee he could look at arts centres. They are truly organisations which are often in remote places. It would be difficult for the Minister to visit them if he were tied up here two days a week, but if we sit only one day a week he could go on tours of small art centres and would learn a great deal. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
would play a crucial part in the dialogue and debate on whether the direction decentralisation in "The Glory of the Garden" were correct. Unless decentralisation spreads outside major cities to arts centres in semi-rural or small urban communities such as Bridgwater, it is the wrong policy and we shall simply transfer the centralisation of arts resources in the capital to regional capitals, and millions of people in north Wales, northern Scotland and in the west country will be denied access to arts provision, which I am sure is not the Minister's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to support our amendment and use Thursdays in a constructive and responsible way to get out and see what it is all about. If he talks to governors he will learn a lot about his wider responsibilities and about the Bill. We are discussing who the governors should be; who are proper, responsible and constructive governors for an arts museum and what should be the level and source of funding. If the Minister used Thursdays to go out into the regions he would learn much about the importance of local authority governors and of local authority finance. He would also learn about the great trends and changes that have takan place in the museums during the past few years, such as the pioneering work done by David Sekers for the Gladstone pottery museum and at the Styal museum for the history of the textile industry just outside Manchester. That has given a totally new dimension to the museum world. The Museum of London understands and is pursuing that dimension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If only the Minister would use his time to go out to the regions and look at, say, the Black Country Museum, instead of being cooped up in Committee two days a week looking at the minutiae of an already written Bill, he would be able to meet the museum's administrators, local trade unions and industry including private industry that has contributed funds and local customers; he could then see that the whole mood, attitude and relevance of museums has changed in recent years. For that change to be sustained, funding must be adequate and governors must understand their communities and how their history should be reflected in the museums. Those are not things that the Minister can learn by listening to Opposition Members in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my hon. Friend for having missed part of his speech. I had some pressing business elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully understand what my hon. Friend is doing: he is concerned that the Minister should be able to get about, which will only be possible if we do not have afternoon sittings. If we did not have afternoon sittings, the Minister might find time to take up my invitation—which he previously declined—to come to Newham, one of the outer regions of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises a whole new dimension by saying that the Minister finds an outer region of the GLC too far away to visit. That reinforces my point that the Minister may experience difficulties in getting to such outlandishly distant places as Stoke-on-Trent and Dudley—all the more reason for releasing him from his responsibilities on at least one day a week, which can be done only by passing our amend-

	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
ment to the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to the "drift" of my argument. Without being unduly sensitive, I take that as a slight textual criticism—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not referring to afternoon sittings at all. We are discussing Thursday sittings, so perhaps the hon. Gentleman would stick to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene to say that I would not wish my hon. Friend to interpret my remarks as being in the slightest way critical of his very powerful speech. Because of my absence, I had not realised just how powerful it was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my argument has been so thrustful that it has got through to my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that I have established a clear case for saying that the Minister would be well advised, both in his work in the Committee and in his wider responsibilities to the Government and the world of the arts, to delete Thursdays from our sittings for the time being. That can be done only by passing our amendment to the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the argument, and not only out of concern for the Minister. Other factors affect all members of the Committee. The Committee comprises hon. Members whose interest in the arts is well established, such as the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Sir D. Price). However, we also welcome other Committee members of whose interest in the arts we were hitherto unaware. The hon. Member for Dudley, West (Dr. Blackburn) made a thoughtful speech on Second Reading, which I read with great interest. I had not associated his name with arts debates before, which may have been ignorance on my part. However, I was delighted to see such an interesting contribution from the Conservative Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other Conservative Members, such as the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley), have a well-established interest in some areas of the arts. The hon. Gentleman has an interest in the film industry but I was not aware that he was acutely interested in museums. I greatly welcome his interest. The hon. Gentleman looks pained and grieved by that aspersion on his interests, and I am sure that pain and grief do not often cloud his face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other Conservative Members are like the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Dicks), who has been a little less forward in his interest of the arts. It is good that he is here but it is also important that he should widen his interest and education in the arts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Dicks) has a rather muscular approach to the arts, as he probably has to most things. I draw to my hon. Friend's attention the fact that the hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East (Mr. Freud) is absent. It is regrettable that we have no representative of the Liberal party to listen to my hon. Friend's most powerful speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that serious point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned that the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Dicks) had an interest
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
in the arts vigorous rather than the arts aesthetic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dicks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My interest in the arts is not like that of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher). I believe that there should be no public support for the arts and that they should be funded by payments from their consumers. I am here to promote that view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be interesting to hear whether the Minister supports his hon. Friend or whether there is already dissention in the Government ranks, which could make our sittings far more interesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very helpful to the Committee that the hon. Gentleman has nailed his colours to the mast so early in our proceedings but he is not alone in his views. His hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth)—where, if Will Shakespeare had never lived, the council would have had to invent him—is also on record as saying that he wants an end to all subsidies. He says that he has been plagued by pressure groups of all kinds wanting an uneconomic pit here and an uneconomic maternity home there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are straying rather far from the sittings motion. We are discussing not the Committee's composition or the qualifications of its members but the times at which it is to sit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be guided by you, Sir Anthony. I wanted to relate the interests and backgrounds of members of the Committee to the sittings motion. I wanted to show that some Committee members' interest in and knowledge of the arts was less well-established than their experience of other Government policy. Like the Minister, they need Thursdays to improve their interest in and knowledge of museums. Unlike the Minister, I do not suggest that they go to the regions and talk to regional arts associations about general arts policy. The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington has little sympathy for or understanding of what museums are about. How can such hon. Members fulfil their responsibilities on the Committee if, before its proceedings end, they do not have every opportunity to get into the country and to learn about museums?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have anticipated the Government's success with the sittings motion and will have cleared their diaries for Tuesday and Thursday mornings for the foreseeable future. I suggest that they do so for many weeks ahead, because there is much in the Bill to discuss. Now that Conservative Members have cleared Thursday mornings in response to the Government Whip, they could use them to visit museums and to learn what they are about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a fair-minded man, I am sure that the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington would learn that his comments about no public support were nonsense. The funding and constitution of governing bodies would be totally different if the hon. Gentleman had his way and we paid for all admissions to arts museums. If we had governors who believed in that sort of admission policy for museums, the museum system of this country would be totally different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there were no Thursday sitting, per-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
haps we could take the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Dicks) round the Museum of London in order to bash a little appreciation into his head. That would support my hon. Friend's argument, as it might prove to be the only way that my hon. Friend and I could inculcate an appreciation of the arts in the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington. We shall bash it into him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will do that job. He and I are of fairly diminutive stature, and I should not like to chance my arm at bashing anything into the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington, who, I suspect, is a great deal tougher and fitter than we are. However, I would happily take him to museums on the Thursday mornings that we are trying to delete from the sittings motion, to try—without wishing to bash him, or incur his ire—to educate him and his hon. Friends as to what museums are about. It is important that the hon. Gentleman should see more museums—apart from the Museum of London— before considering the Bill, which has to do with the constitution of the governing body and the museum's level of funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our point is genuine: the time that hon. Members leave clear in their diaries on Thursday mornings could, if our amendment is passed, be used more constructively and could lead to better scrutiny of the legislation by Conservative Members. I suspect that, when they make their contributions to the debate, some Conservative Members will have to say that museums have not been in the forefront of their political concerns. If they are to fulfil their responsibilities as I am sure they would wish to, their understanding of the subject should not be confined to the technicalities of the three clauses but should range over the whole question of museums policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, Northwest mentioned that the alliance, as represented by the hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East (Mr. Freud) is not present this morning. The hon. Gentleman in question approached me in the lobby to explain that he had three other Committee meetings this morning, one of which was a Select Committee. That proves my point. If we meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays we may be denied the contribution of the hon. Gentleman, who spoke on Second Reading and made, as always, an interesting and knowledgeable speech. We need him in the Committee, and he may not be the only hon. Member who has responsibilities on a Select Committee on Tuesday or Thursday mornings. It is important that the full Committee be here to scrutinise the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for explaining why the hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East (Mr. Freud) is not present. I did not draw attention to his absence in a critical spirit; I was merely surprised that he was not here, and I hope that when he reads 
	<i>Hansard</i> he will understand that there was no personal animosity in my intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
the sitting of this Committee would be unfortunate if it took away Members such as the hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East, who undoubtedly possesses a well-established expertise in the arts, and whose presence would assist the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While all hon. Members would be interested to know the reason for not sitting again before Christmas, the important point is that, both for the Minister and all Committee members, a sitting for one morning a week for a small piece of legislation for which the Government have no immediate rush would allow us to sustain our interest on Thursday mornings in museums in particular and in the arts generally. That would lead to a better and more considered response to the legislation. Hon. Members on both sides want to give the maximum possible scrutiny to the Bill. We owe it to the people of London, to those who work at the museum and to the governors of the Museum of London to do as good a job as we can. If the knowledge of some hon. Members is scant or slight, Thursday mornings would be better spent on furthering their knowledge.

In considering some legislation such as the Gas Bill which will come up shortly, it would be stupid and trivial for hon. Members to suggest that they met only one day a week, but for a small Bill such as this, where there is no rush or urgency that is not the case. There is no danger of this Bill falling off the parliamentary programme in July and no time scale for getting the legislation through. We all have a genuine interest in the Bill. There is no party political animosity but a genuine concern to get the right form of funding and the right governors, if only for the two years until the next Labour Government come in and return the authority of the museum to democratic accountability. We want to make sure that the damage done to the Museum of London in the interim is as minimal as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because Conservative Members believe that this is the correct way to manage the museum, and because the Opposition want a damage limitation exercise on the handling of that museum during the next two years, we both have a genuine interest in getting the legislation right. I do not believe that the Minister will say anything to suggest that there is an enormous rush. I challenge him to tell us why he needs to get the legislation through by a certain date. He may say that it is so that he can get back to his other duties, but he could fulfil those duties and contribute to the Bill by accepting our amendment to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The suggestion that we sit today and thereafter on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the new year is ideal. I want to discuss the Bill and I shall be more than grateful when we get to that stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today we have started our deliberations. Some of us have taken a great interest in the Bill and in the Museum of London before today. Between now and 14 January, when the Committee meets again, is a period of one month. During that time we should all concentrate on the matters in hand. It would be cynical to suggest that members of the Committee will be dealing with other matters, such as their own corre-

	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
spondence, rather than concentrating on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time scale between now and 14 January is almost exactly right to research into the matters that will form part of our deliberations. Once we have finished our research and are refreshed after the Christmas recess, when we can concentrate on the world of education and knowledge and the rich heritage shown in a most enjoyable and successful way by the museum, we shall return impatient to discuss the Bill. Not to discuss it on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which is the normal process, is an attack on the world of culture and the arts in London. I beg my hon. Friend to agree that we discuss the Bill without further ado when we return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for the Arts (Mr. Richard Luce)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I
have tried to listen to all the speeches with the greatest of care and interest. I have been remarkably touched by the great and rather unusual warmth that has been shown this morning for my personal welfare and interests. The hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) said that he was anxious that I should have time to settle into my job. I appreciate his concern for my welfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had nearly two hours to settle in this morning. I feel well-established and I am looking forward to getting down to the meat of the debate. As the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) said, there is much to discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) for suggesting that I should use Thursdays to visit the regions, which was most considerate of him. I shall contemplate such visits but I shall not make them on Thursdays while the Committee is sitting—I believe that the Committee will pass the sitting motion—because the Bill is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regard visiting the regions as an important part of my job. I have been twice to Newcastle-upon-Tyne and to the south-west and to Wales. I am grateful to Opposition Members for their concern for my welfare but their real concern should be the welfare of the Bill. It is important that it should make sensible progress in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that, by any stretch of the imagination, anyone could accuse me of trying to rush the Committee. The hon. Member for Paisley, South said that the Bill was being taken "at appalling speed", but to suggest that we meet today and resume in five weeks' time is not exactly rushing. My experience is that Committees progress at a reasonable pace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) was most flattering about the Committee. Perhaps he was comparing it with others on which he has served when he described it as a cerebral Committee. The hon. Gentleman may be right. The description fits my hon. Friends but only time will tell whether it fits Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are a cerebral Committee we should have the capacity to sit twice a week. Every Committee on which I have served during my 15 years in Parliament has been able to cope with both Tuesday and Thursday morning sittings. With its great talent this Committee should also be able to do so. As the hon. Member for Paisley, South said, the Bill is an important one. It affects the future of the Museum of London
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
and it is only sensible that we should allow adequate time to discuss it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, I said that, if Parliament approved, it was important to make adequate provisions for the museum's future by the time of the abolition of the GLC. For the sake of the museum's long-term security, it is important that we should make some progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the sittings motion is slightly unusual in that I have suggested a gap between now and our next sitting. Although the hon. Member for Paisley, South was kind enough to intervene during the speech of his hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, I must explain that I have a long-standing commitment to the Select Committee on Education, Science and Arts to discuss the arts, their funding and their prospects. I know that all members consider that task important. I had to take commitment into account and I am grateful for the co-operation of hon. Members on each side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I thought that we should at least make a start before Christmas. We have started with a Christmas atmosphere, with plenty of goodwill, which I hope will continue in January. After Christmas, it is only reasonable that we should make normal progress under the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh (Sir D. Price) made a valuable intervention and raised the question of facilitating a visit to the Museum of London. I accept that it may be possible for hon. Members to make their own arrangements, but I am happy to facilitate such a trip. My hon. Friend the member for Romsey and Waterside (Mr. Colvin) will make whatever plans need to be made. It may be possible to make the visit before we resume in January.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not being unreasonable in putting forward the sittings motion. I hope that, once they have had time to contemplate it, hon. Members will accept the motion as being reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have listened with care and pleasure to the Minister's reply. We welcome his tone—I am sure it is not just a Christmas tone but one characteristic of the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, he has not accepted our arguments, so I shall urge my hon. Friends to vote for the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In referring to osmosis, or wainscotting, or whatever, I was trying to avoid the Minister's terminology. He said that there had been discussions. I always thought that we did not have discussions in this place. But the Minister was frank about it, and, of course, our discussions were mutually helpful. We wanted to help the Minister, who was in a difficult position that we well understood. He needed to go to the Select Committee, and therefore suggested that we meet today, make the necessary progress, discuss the sittings motion and resume re-invigorated after a Christmas break of four weeks' research, as the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) has suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After voting on the motion—I have great hopes of Conservative Members supporting us—I might seek permission to move progress, because it would not be helpful now to start on the amendments, especially as I intend to raise a point of order in that connection
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
about the grouping together of the five amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my long experience of Committees, it is a fact of life that if hon. Members decide together to meet on Tuesday, they will finish in the same month as if they disagree over the sittings motion and meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Thus it might have been better for the Minister to accept our suggestion, as Committees often end precisely on 22 March, regardless of whether they meet once or twice a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Museum of London Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesday 14 January 1986 and Thursday 16 January 1986 and thereafter on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Anthony. We are not happy about the grouping of the amendments and we should like you to reconsider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with two or three possible options. The main burden of the Bill is to establish the situation affecting the governing and funding of the Museum of London when the GLC as a body no longer exists. There are alternatives to the Government's proposals that there should be a mixture of the Corporation of the City of London and Government appointees. There are other ways to maintain a more democratic governorship of the board of the museum and we are putting forward alternative methods to deal with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One is my simple proposition that we stick to the present governors. Although the GLC no longer exists, appointments made by the GLC relating to the museum should remain in office and presumably be subject to the same turnover. Amendments to that may be tabled later when we have dealt with the first amendment. The second proposal is that the museum should become part of the Inner London Education Authority. The third is that it should be dealt with by the successor boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These options should not be debated together but taken one after the other. That is appropriate for a clause 1 debate. We appeal to you, Sir Anthony, to consider taking the amendments separately. For example, amendments Nos. 1 and 3 could be taken together. I hope that you will give sympathetic consideration to that proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able assist the hon. Member. I am prepared to consider regrouping the amendments to provide for separate debates on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
three principles that the hon. Gentleman wishes to debate. It would probably be for the convenience of the Committee if we now begin with amendment No. 1, which is a self-contained point. We can perhaps discuss the possible regrouping of amendments at the next sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I not only thank you, Sir Anthony, but congratulate you. Sometimes we get so tied up in formalities that procedure becomes difficult, Your helpful intervention and that of the Clerk makes sense. In Committee after Committee over the years I have found that we could not discuss what we wanted to discuss because we got tied down in formalities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be brief. We believe that we shall win the next election. If we do, the fewer disturbances the better. The logical course would be to let arrangements remain as they are. The GLC has made perfectly good appointments and there is no reason why they should not stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can deal with the two-yearly or three-yearly rotation of members either on Report or, if the Government accept the amendment, at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years the GLC has helped to endorse the necessity and the correctness of a Government for London as a whole. In the context of the Bill the GLC has done more. I make this observation unquestioningly and I shall be shot down in flames by my own local authority and by local authorities throughout the country. Those of us involved in the arts know the GLC's devotion and support for the arts, which has not been bettered by any other local authority. Its appointments to institutions have not been ideological or partisan but based on the best interests of the museums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Museum of London is not only the property of the Corporation of the City of London but is a combination of the Guildhall museum and the old London museum. It is almost a historic and folk museum. It reflects the way of life and the history of the people of Greater London, not only of the City. It is unthinkable that the governancy of the museum should not reflect Greater London, although I am perfectly happy for its funding to remain with the City of London and the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have put forward alternative solutions, but the cleanest way is to accept my simple, modest proposal that the existing governors remain on the board. In two years' time, when we have won the general election and reformed the government of London in line with every capital city in the world, we can resume where we left off and return some sanity to the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
