	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Lanarkshire (Motherwell) Enterprise Zones Designation Order 1993 (S.I. 1993, No. 24).</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman:</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> With the agreement of the Committee, we shall also consider the other orders before us, namely, the Lanarkshire (Hamilton) Enterprise Zones Designation Order 1993 (S.I. 1993, No. 23) and the Lanarkshire (Monklands) Enterprise Zones Designation Order 1993 (S.I. 1993, No. 25).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This sitting is very much a constituency occasion. It is fair to say that the Minister, who has shown a great interest in Lanarkshire, will not be surprised by the presence of a number of my hon. Friends. My hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell, South (Dr. Bray) is greatly involved in these matters, particularly those arising from the closure of Ravenscraig. The order covers parts of the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson). My hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood) might make a case for parts of Clydesdale being included in an enterprise zone. My hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell, North (Dr. Reid) has shown a great interest in these matters following the closure of Ravenscraig. My hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) has a particular interest in the issue of new towns in his constituency. I am sure that he appreciates that some of the problems of the new towns are not shared by other parts of Lanarkshire, such as my own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency there are enormous areas of dereliction—the steel industry is virtually non-existent and there is high unemployment. The people of Lanarkshire are arguing for the special recognition of the industrial situation arising from rapid changes in Lanarkshire—not least the decline of the steel industry and the closure of Ravenscraig. The Minister has been exceptionally courteous, certainly to the district councils of Monklands and Strathkelvin in my constituency. I am sure that that will be the tone of his contribution to today's debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are meeting in this Committee because of the serious problems facing the economy in Lanarkshire. We have witnessed devastation in Lanarkshire, not simply because of the closure of Ravenscraig and the fact that it was closed in a calculated way following privatisation, but because of the other job losses in industry after industry, the cuts in the training budget, and because the enthusiasm of the people of Lanarkshire to regenerate industry and to play their part in the manufacturing economy is not reflected in Government policy. Although we welcome the orders as far as they go, they do not match the enormous problem that Lanarkshire faces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 7 January 1992 British Steel announced its intention to close Ravenscraig by September 1992. The Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
will recall that on the same day the Government announced that they would approach the European Community to obtain enterprise zone status for certain areas. The orders are a consequence of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends will speak from their deep knowledge of their constituencies. I shall simply make some general observations and perhaps refer briefly to my constituency of Monklands and give other hon. Members the opportunity to make their points. Although we welcome the orders as far as they go, we appreciate that the debate on enterprise zones and their contribution to the economy will continue. We insist that, if there is to be a strategy for enterprise zones to deal with our problems, it should be concerned with new jobs. I am not convinced that that is always the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) has views on the recent switch of a sizeable insurance company from Perth to Dundee where it had all the benefits of an enterprise zone. That is splendid for Dundee and I support everything that my hon. Friends who represent that city want to see established in their constituencies. However, in common with what was described in the west of Scotland as the Radio Clyde debate on Clydebank, we must seriously consider whether enterprise zones lead to new jobs or merely take jobs from other parts of Scotland whose need for employment may be just as great as that of the areas in which they are located.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about the technical proposals in the orders that we are considering and whether they reflect the determination of the Government and all agencies concerned with enterprise zones to improve conditions. The agencies include Scottish Enterprise, the Lanarkshire development agency and local councils in Strathclyde region. I am interested in hearing whether the consultations that I assumed were held with Strathclyde region meant that the proposals would not inhibit its own industrial promotion activities, including an option to borrow if that was necessary to promote the job opportunities and skills of the people of Lanarkshire and its ability to respond to a modern Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployment creates desperation in Lanarkshire and the levels are appalling in Hamilton, Monklands and Motherwell. Most alarming is the rise in male unemployment in those areas. My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton may wish to comment on conditions in his constituency but I understand that its unemployment rate increased from 13.6 per cent., 4,077 people, to 14.8 per cent., 4,443 people, between December 1991 and December 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency of Monklands unemployment increased from 14.7 per cent., 4,321 people, to 15.6 per cent., 4,606 people. In Motherwell, the rate increased from 14.7 percent, 5,843 people, to 16.4 per cent., 6,496 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am citing figures but we all know that they represent people, their families and the devastation that unemployment brings to the quality of life in our communities. The sad backdrop to the orders is that male unemployment in Lanarkshire increased by more than 30 per cent, between December 1989 and December 1992, according to figures from Strathclyde region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In accepting the orders, I hope that the Minister will not assume that the Opposition believes that they go
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
far enough to deal with the problems of our economy, infrastructure, industrial investment and so on. The proposals obviously take account of conditions in Monklands, where a number of steel jobs were lost in Coatbridge. There was the closure of Gartcosh, cutbacks in the Imperial steel works in Airdrie and a spin-off in the rest of Lanarkshire from Clydesdale to Ravenscraig.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the setting up in December 1990 of the Lanarkshire working group was welcomed. Its report, published in June 1991, was certainly welcomed by Opposition Members. One of its most significant proposals was the creation of
	<br><blockquote><p>"selected strategic and industrial development sites in North Lanarkshire as Enterprise Zones."</p></blockquote>
The orders result from that strongly held view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is needed is a wide-ranging, effective and co-ordinated strategy for the regeneration of Lanarkshire. I should be doing less than full service to the people of Lanarkshire if I had not said that. The enterprise zone will not of itself, wherever it may be placed, be a panacea for existing economic problems—clearly, more initiatives will be required—but it will go some way to alleviating existing problems. For those reasons, I welcome it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us specifically the benefits he believes will be derived from each order? The interesting Library paper explains in detail the benefits of enterprise zones. They are exempted from rates on industrial and commercial property and from development land tax. The zones operate under a system in which there is 100 per cent, allowance for corporation and income tax purposes for capital expenditure on industrial and commercial buildings. The siting of enterprise zones means a simplification of planning procedures and speedier administration of planning controls and a reduction to a minimum of Government requests for statistical information. Employers are exempt from industrial training levies and from requirements to supply information to industrial training boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a strong view on training and we need more of it. We need a commitment to training in Lanarkshire to make the most of the industrial and economic opportunities that might exist. A further benefit of enterprise zone designation is that applications for customs facilities will be processed as a matter of priority and some criteria will be relaxed. Will the Minister tell us how those principles will apply specifically to the orders?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we welcome the orders as far as they go, we recall that, following the closure of Ravenscraig, the Prime Minister said that he would not forget Lanarkshire. We want a full scale commitment to a strategy for job creation in Lanarkshire. We welcome the work carried out by most of the agencies that are involved. We want a reiteration of the commitment to the Eurofreight terminal in Mossend, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell, North. That is crucial to our infrastructure. We have had numerous and helpful discussions with the Minister about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need for debate in a constituency sense about the orders. We say that unashamedly because of our commitments to our constituencies. The reason we prayed against the orders was that we wanted to put our views on record. The Minister will also have the opportunity to tell the people of Lanarkshire how he sees the position and how the Government intend to respond to the appalling problems that we face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.43 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I tell the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) that I welcome the opportunity to debate the Lanarkshire enterprise zone designation orders. I accept entirely the basis on which the debate is taking place. Opposition Members have prayed against the orders not because they do not welcome them but because of their wish to debate the implications of the orders and how they relate to the problems to which the hon. Gentleman rightly referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish first to make one or two general observations. I shall respond later to the more detailed constituency issues that will no doubt be raised during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Monklands, West said, the specific measures can be traced back to December 1990, when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced the establishment of the Lanarkshire working group to consider the problems in Lanarkshire caused in particular by restructuring in the steel industry. That group was quickly established with representatives of all the key players in the Lanarkshire economy. It worked speedily and efficiently in producing findings and recommendations for action. It identified the need for new and quickly available industrial sites as a priority for the regeneration of Lanarkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hard on the heels of the establishment of the working group, the Lanarkshire development agency came into operation as part of the Scottish Enterprise network. I hope that everyone agrees that the local enterprise company has been a major driving force in the regeneration process for Lanarkshire. It now approaches the end of its second year of operation. It has an excellent track record as the Government's agent for economic, environmental and skills development in Lanarkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to spend time ennumerating all its achievements. It has been supported by Scottish Enterprise National and by its local-authority, private-sector and other partners. It has achieved a great deal in those two years for Lanarkshire and for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, West asked how the orders related to Strathclyde regional council's development activities. I assure the hon. Gentleman that Strathclyde is happy that the enterprise zone does not cut across its industrial development activities. The council was a member of the working party and fully supported the creation of an enterprise zone. The regional council has been fully involved in the selection of sites and of the members of the management group that will oversee the development of the zone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one example of the cooperative approach of everyone trying to work together in tackling Lanarkshire's problems and exploiting its opportunities. It is important that our real and proper perception of people working positively together on what are widely admitted to be serious problems, is widely shared. Outsiders will not invest in losers; they will invest only in people who believe that they will and can succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have invested a great deal in Lanarkshire, not only in financial resources, although it is undeniable that we have made substantial additional resources available through Scottish Enterprise and the LDA via local authorities and the Scottish Office. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
additional cost to the Exchequer of the enterprise zone orders, will exceed £50 million. We are confident that that investment will be repaid. We are also investing a great deal of energy and optimism in Lanarkshire's future, an investment to which the hon. Gentleman kindly referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are acutely alive to the problems that unemployment has brought to Lanarkshire. I do not deny that key tasks need to be tackled and that a great deal more must be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the need for a general strategy. We hope that the Lanarkshire regeneration strategy, which involves the local authorities, will be publicly available in two months or so. The document will be available for hon. Members to study.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have laid the foundations on which the new Lanarkshire economy can be built. The enterprise zone is one of the building blocks and will be a major contributor to the regeneration process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the likely implications of the enterprise zone. If it is successful, as we have every reason to believe it will be, it will create 17,000 gross jobs and more than 8,300 net additional jobs for the people of Lanarkshire and their families. I mentioned the sum of £50 million from the Exchequer, which is being invested in various ways in the zone. We expect that to lever £250 million worm of private sector investment. Those are substantial sums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that background to the orders has been helpful to the Committee. I look forward to hearing the comments that Opposition Members want to make as constituency Members, and I hope to have an opportunity to respond later in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.51 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Jeremy Bray 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Motherwell, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All my right hon. and hon. Friends welcome the enterprise zone proposals but, as the Minister said, they can be only a part of a wider strategy that must deal with the future of all the people of Lanarkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appropriate that students from Braidhurst high school in my constituency are in the Room listening to our debate. Lanarkshire high schools have the secret of the future in their hearts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tax incentives will be especially important in the enterprise zone. I have little doubt that development will take place there. The site preparations are long overdue. Those developments should not divert attention from the complementary developments needed to make a success of the re-industrialisation of Lanarkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, perhaps half the jobs created in the enterprise zone will result from the diversion of jobs that would have been created elsewhere. Because of the location of most of the enterprise zone sites along the easily accessible motorway routes to the entire central belt, many of the jobs, whether new or diverted, will be filled by people living outwith the area—from Glasgow and Edinburgh. I do not begrudge them that, but it is mistaken to think of the enterprise zone as being for the benefit merely of Lanarkshire. It will provide benefits for the central belt over a much wider range.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is some danger, therefore, that the intention of providing jobs for Lanarkshire fulfilling its industrial
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
potential following the loss of the steel industry will be dissipated. It is unfortunate that not all members of the Committee have maps showing the proposed enterprise zones. The red patches on the map indicate the sites scheduled. They are located along the main motorway and ring the principal steel site areas, which are left stranded in the town centres, principally of Motherwell and Wishaw.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The steel sites, particularly the Ravenscraig, Lanarkshire and Clydesdale works sites, are large urban sites. They were ringed by what were once steelworkers' houses and they were served for industrial purposes by railways, not roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ravenscraig—the latest of the steelworks which operated for only one generation—was manned from the start mainly by workers who were not steelworkers by trade and who came from a wider area in Lanarkshire—many were from mining and other industries which experienced a decline in employment in the 1950s and 1960s. The inner, urban core in the steel sites seems to have been forgotten by the planners who scheduled the enterprise zone sites. The danger is that we might create a ghetto—an inner ring of unemployment—around blighted town centres that are remote in terms of public access and remote from new jobs in public transport terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A housewife looking for a half shift who lives in Paisley or Gowkthrapple will simply find it impractical to get to the new industrial enterprise zones sites along the motorway unless she has a car. The people who do not have cars need the jobs. There is a danger of a serious social problem developing in areas that already have high levels of unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The planners argued that to reclaim the steel sites would take time and cost a lot of money and that it would be quicker to develop on green field sites. However, the development could have gone ahead just as quickly on some of the brown field sites. The Lanarkshire work site—which is in the middle of Motherwell and has good road access—has been available for development for the past 10 years but nothing has been done. It has been in the ownership of first the Scottish development agency, then Scottish Enterprise and now the Lanarkshire development agency. Still nothing has been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consequently the industrial land market is in danger of being over-subscribed by subsidised land from within the enterprise zones while the inner urban decay will be allowed to continue. It is especially unfortunate because the main railway line from Glasgow to Euston—now with main line trains to Edinburgh and down the east coast—passes alongside the Lanarkshire and Ravenscraig sites. That offers obvious scope for major redevelopment similar to the development of Bristol Parkway station and many other parkway stations which are being developed around the big cities in the south. There has been no such thinking in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am asking for the simultaneous—not the delayed—tackling of the urban problems and the redevelopment of the steel sites. The hon. Member who represents a constituency in Teeside, in which area I used to have a constituency, well knows the problems of urban decay and the necessity of tackling them. The Scottish Office seems to have lost sight of those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The emerging attitude of Strathclyde region, Scottish Enterprise and other parts of the Scottish Office seems to

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
be that with the enterprise zone, the Eurofreight terminal and the Strathclyde business park, Lanarkshire will have had its share of development. That is understandable in the light of needs elsewhere in Scotland which are pressing and urgent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that, according to the criterion of what will benefit Scotland as a whole most, the problems of urban decay and the reclamation of the steel sites have to be tackled. There is a strong case for industrial redevelopment. It is necessary to make the best use of what are inevitably limited resources and inevitably limited and time-constrained political good will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister said that there would be, there is no plan or strategy for the redevelopment of the steel sites. So the options tend to close. I shall use the important example of road access to the steel sites and to Ravenscraig, Clydesdale and the heart of Motherwell. The road access must match motorway standard, or at least the dual carriageway standard of the A725, which has been so successful in attracting development in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ove Arup feasibility study, which was commissioned by the Lanarkshire development agency in consultation with other authorities, spelt out several options for the future road development in Lanarkshire. The cheapest link between Carfin and Holytown from Ravenscraig to the motorway, to the north, is already pre-empted with Strathclyde regional council plan putting in only a two-lane single carriageway in next year's capital programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The railway bridge is out to contract now. That is going ahead in advance of a strategic decision about what the road plans should be. A possible preferable link to that specific route is one that goes through the Clydesdale steel site up to the M8. However, that would go slap bang through the middle of the Eurofreight terminal, which has been pre-empted for other purposes. How the planners will get round that problem I do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third possible link and a necessary complement to whichever of the other two routes is chosen is the link to the M8 to the south. That would complete the fast link concept between the M8 and the M74. It would make it much easier for traffic coming in from the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale. The traffic coming up from the south could spread itself round the central zone if there were a fast link from the south up to Edinburgh or Glasgow through either part of Motherwell. That road is, however, being restricted by local housing developments, not only by current developments, but by those that are proposed under the enterprise zone plans. The Excelsior Park site alongside the railway blocks a road access route to the main steel sites.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a sign of the political attitudes developing in Scotland, Strathclyde regional council, as the strategic planning authority, is using an obsolete structure plan to call in and block useful supporting developments such as the Cleland estate proposal for school playing fields and good quality housing adjacent to the Ravenscraig site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That planning proposal will go on appeal before the Secretary of State, so I do not expect the Minister to tell us the outcome. That is a clear example of the political reaction from the rest of Scotland in that it considers that Lanarkshire has had all that is due to it. Such an argument is not in the interests of Scotland but, given the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
considerable planning confusion that exists, such a reaction is understandable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further and higher education and research and technology transfer have made an important contribution to re-development in Lanarkshire. They have not yet begun to be integrated with the industrial development proposals. There is already the prospect of the health board, with its influence over the training of nurses and the College of Nursing, forming links with one Scottish university and Bell college in Hamilton forming links with another. As a result, there will be confusion and dissipation of effort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulties are caused by classic planning confusion between authorities with lack of strategy that is in danger of causing wasteful and conflicting plans and developments and frustrating overall intentions. Such confusions were analysed and ways in which to avoid them were developed after the war, when serious strategic planning was first adopted. Under the baleful influence of the short-termism of Tory Scottish Ministers, those lessons seem to have been forgotten.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proliferating agencies and the divorce between funding and statutory powers, so beloved of Scottish Tory Ministers, is at the root of the muddle. They talk about co-ordination but the reason they do so is that they have created so many different authorities that fall over each other to develop proposals, put them forward and implement them without taking account the overall strategic direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the Lanarkshire working group as a success. It was chaired by Scottish Office civil servants. Only officials sat on it. It had no public accountability. When he came to details, the Minister could not sustain his case. The orders are a collection of proposals of the past 30 years put together by officials who wanted to get their pet schemes through. There is no strategy. The strategic plans that I have talked about cannot be found in the plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be fuller, franker, earlier consultation. A strategic planning brief is quickly needed to relate the physical, social and economic aspects. It must break out of development stereotypes. There is scope for a much wider contribution to be made to planning Lanarkshire's development, perhaps by international competition— why not?—on the working environment of the future, with particular reference to Lanarkshire and the steel sites, seeing the enterprise zone in its total environment. We could find industrial sponsors with local interests, including British Telecom, Mercury, British Rail, British Steel and Motorala, which I believe, would be enthusiastic about the idea of promoting a well-publicised international competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no room for the closed-shop attitudes that too often rule the narrow professional cliques that assume responsibility for those matters. Why should the best of British architecture been found only in Paris, Hong Kong or Tokyo? Why not in the industrially redeveloped heart of Britain? I hope that the Minister will today and in the future show greater efficiency and effectiveness and strategic sense than he has so far in Lanarkshire's redevelopment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Hood 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydesdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give the orders a qualified welcome. I am disappointed that Clydesdale was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
not considered. I note that one or two Maastricht rebels seem to be serving penance as members of the Committee. One has gone AWOL; the other is listening intently to Lanarkshire's problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am tempted to describe the Clydesdale constituency, which I am pleased and honoured to represent. It covers more than 550 square miles. The cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow would fit inside it five or six times over. It was a former mining constituency, but since the late 1960s and early 1970s mining has disappeared. Small mining communities still exist, but they are devastated by high unemployment and the social problems that go with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there are major rural interests. Tragically, we suffer not only the urban deprivation of the former mining communities; there is strong evidence of devastation being caused by rural deprivation. Clydesdale has more than 4,000 unemployed. When the figures are released tomorrow, that number will be seen to have increased significantly. With a population of more than 80,000, Clydesdale has a mixture of problems. We need help to regenerate the local economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, my support for the orders is qualified. One of my great fears is that the enterprise zones will be allowed to act like a black hole, sucking employment, funds and companies into them out of Clydesdale. With all our problems, we genuinely fear that companies will be tempted to move into the enterprise zones. That would have a devastating effect in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had some news last week, of which I am sure the Minister is aware, that will have tragic consequences for my constituency. Because of the uncertainty of the proposed privatisation of rail, Strathclyde regional council put a hold on all rail investment, which amounted to more than £50 million. More than £5 million of that was intended for investment in a rail link from Hamilton to Larkhall in the Clydesdale constituency. That delay is causing uncertainty and if it leads to the negation of the planned development, that, too, will have a disastrous effect on my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will be talking to Strathclyde regional council to clear up any uncertainty and to urge it to press ahead with the investment, which is what I am doing. Recently, we heard good news, albeit about three years later than we had expected to be told about it, about a bypass in Stonehouse which is due to start in April. It is planned in two phases and there is a great fear mat phase two has been written out of the capital programme because of restraints on Government support to the regional council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will investigate that matter, because it would be nonsense to proceed with phase one of the bypass and to stop work on phase two. That would leave us with only half of the bypass. I note that the Minister is laughing. I do not blame him for that and if the matter were not so serious, I would join him in laughing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give my qualified support to the order but I ask the Minister to remind his colleagues that the Lanarkshire enterprise zone was named after the town of Lanark, which is located in the centre of Clydesdale. As the Member of Parliament for that constituency, I claim that it should be given equal consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this opportunity to discuss the enterprise zones that have been created in Lanarkshire. When I walked into the Room and saw the hon. Members for Stafford (Mr. Cash) and for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen), I believed that I had left the rarified world of the debate on the Maastricht treaty to deal with matters of vital importance to my constituents, but I thought that the nightmare had recurred. I have often thought of the hon. Member for Stafford as an "Oor Willie" character but he left us very quickly. However, the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West keeps his attention fixed on the business of the Committee, and he is a man with rare discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With you, Mr. Hill, as Chairman, we have someone who could not come from much further away from Lanarkshire in representing Southampton, but I know that there is no ignorance about the industrial heartland of Scotland even in that part of the world. This may seem to be a rather parochial debate and Conservative Members who have been dragooned into the Committee may perceive it as such, but it is not. Lanarkshire is the industrial heartland of Scotland and what happens there, for good or ill, affects the Scottish economy, which is intimately connected with the British economy as a whole. So the economic health of Lanarkshire is of much wider importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not consider ourselves to be a locality. I hope that the Government do not, either. I represent Hamilton. Hamilton is, and has always been, the county town of the varied landscape of Lanarkshire and we expect to play a major role in the regeneration of Lanarkshire, which must happen if the Scottish economy and, indeed the British, is to be revived. I welcome the enterprise zones, with the caveats of my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West. They are a step forward—one of the building blocks, as the Minister said—toward die regeneration that is so vital for an area so badly hit in die past by steel closures and, before them, mining closures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Lanarkshire Members of Parliament met the Prime Minister only a few months ago, he told us that he believed Lanarkshire to be a victim of history. We agree, but believe it to have a future. Almough Labour Members say, righdy, that enterprise zones are not sufficient to deal with me crisis that we face, they can make a contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be problems for Strathclyde regional council over the borrowing consents that will be required to make the infrastructural developments of the enterprise zones, especially the Blantyre park zone, which is in my constituency. The Leechlee road site is also at the heart of Hamilton, although the problem is perhaps less severe mere. What worries me about the Government's reliance on the enterprise zone policy is mat it has been abandoned elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Everywhere else the Government have given up on enterprise zones as a principal instrument of regeneration. That worry is at me back of my mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote from a letter that hon. Members have received this week from a constituent of mine, Mr. Alex Brown, who is chief executive of Midscot training services—a very worthy, largely engineering training institution that deals with the private sector. He has written a non-partisan letter, explaining his fear that manufacturing industry seems to be losing out in the retraining of redundant steel workers. Regrettably, that is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0115">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
the result of the choice of the redundant steel workers themselves to turn their backs on manufacturing and to retrain in other areas. He expresses an anxiety common to Labour Members, which should be shared by the whole House, that that does not bode well for the future. The letter says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would ask that, if you have the opportunity to influence any decisions, you bear the above in mind, as economic recovery will only be achieved in the central belt if we can revitalise our manufacturing capabilities."</p></blockquote>
I put that point to the Minister today, because I am sure that, with his background, he will agree with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friends have said, we need a comprehensive strategy for Lanarkshire and for the recovery of the Scottish economy. Lanarkshire has immense resources of people, talent and a will to survive and thrive. I hope that the enterprise zones will be a building block in its recovery, which is intimately connected with the recovery of the general Scottish economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.18 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. John Reid 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Motherwell, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, like my hon. Friends, I welcome the chance to elaborate on points connected to the enterprise zones. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell, South, whose ingenuity and inventiveness provided us with that opportunity. He, with other hon. Friends of mine, has comprehensively explained our feelings not about the enterprise zones but about the suggestion that they are not only a necessary but a sufficient condition of the revival of Lanarkshire. We take the view that they are a necessary, but not a sufficient condition to achieve a comprehensive revolution in the Lanarkshire economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not rehearse the arguments on the background of the orders—they are known to all members of the Committee—even though some may have been consumed or subsumed by the Maastricht Bill. I am sure that all hon. Members know of Lanarkshire's problems. The area was based on two heavy industries—mining, which is not completely depleted, and the steel industry, which now has 600 or 700 employees compared with the 15,000 or 20,000 employed there a decade ago. Those figures speak for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be more gentle with the Scottish Office than usual. We are fortunate that, to some extent, the Government have taken a non-partisan approach to Lanarkshire's problems. Although we have debated the subject in the House, from the Prime Minister down to die Scottish Office—I should probably say from the Scottish Office down to the Prime Minister—the Government have recognised the problems that we face. At least in theory, and sometimes in practice, the Government have given assistance to help us overcome our problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context, we welcome the orders. We welcome the additional money given to Motherwell district in the past. My hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale expressed our worries about the black-hole syndrome when, instead of creating new jobs, an enterprise zone can suck jobs and employment from the surrounding areas. However, I take heart from the Lanarkshire development agency's assertion, which I believe to be backed by facts, that, of the 1,500 jobs that it expects to have been created
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
in the enterprise zone areas, about 900 or 1,000 are new jobs, not merely displaced jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear, particularly for Conservative Back Benchers, who have been dragooned into the Committee, that we do not expect the Government to do everything. During our struggle of the past 10 years, we have never taken the view that Lanarkshire could be redeveloped only by bureaucrats in Whitehall with an endless supply of Government money. Lanarkshire's particular problem is to create a diversified economy. We do not want the whole of Lanarkshire's industrial belt to be utterly dependent on only one or two industries. That reinforces our view that the Government cannot do everything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, we are talking about a partnership. We also recognise that jobs will come back through the workings of the market. We have seen that in Consett and in Corby. However, even Conservative Members—who may be more free-marketeers than Opposition Members—will know that the market takes time to work and to adjust. Consett and Corby took 10 to 15 years to adjust—a whole generation of young people missed out because there was nothing for them while the market mechanism was adjusting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall mention one of my hobby horses. I am particularly disappointed that we did not win the short-term project of building a national stadium in Lanarkshire. It was supported by Opposition Members and by the Government, including the Prime Minister. Scotland could have had a new football stadium, but, courtesy of the secretary of the Scottish football association, we no longer have that chance, so Lanarkshire, Scottish football supporters and the sporting authorities in Scotland have all lost out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we won the Eurofreight terminal, part of one of the enterprise zones. I am glad that the Government have said that they would do nothing to influence British Rail's decision, so we state clearly that its decision to come to Mossend in my constituency was based purely on the merits of the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was a good decision for two reasons. First, BR recognised that the geographical location of Lanarkshire is perfect as a distribution centre for manufacturing and, I suggest, for service industries. Secondly, BR recognised the quality of the work force in Lanarkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that we did not demand that the Government do everything. Lanarkshire has never asked for charity. We have never come with a begging bowl. The workers, especially at Ravenscraig but also in other industries, have never made a promise that they have not kept. They have never failed to meet a target and have never made a demand that could not be realised. We are not asking the Government for charity and nor do we think that they can do everything. We believe, however, that there are several ways in which they could assist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first way in which the Government could assist, as private enterprise will not, is in me provision of infrastructure, particularly roads. The Minister will know our view that the up-grading of the A8 to motorway status—the entire M8—is a vital part of the infrastructural development. I know that he has already taken that on board. The motorway link between the M8 and the M74 is equally important. That road completes the focal point of the road infrastructure in Lanarkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0116">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Secondly, on training, I shall not elaborate, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton mentioned our fear that the nature of training, which is the result of people's choice, not a Government imposition, may be swinging away from manufacturing. Certain stories are beginning to reach me. I ask only that any of the redundant steelworkers at present undertaking a course financed by British Steel will be guaranteed that the course will finish completely, not 10 weeks before it is supposed to finish. Participants must undergo the full course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, on the environment, my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell, South spoke at length about the reclamation of the steel sites. There is an urgent need for a guarantee that money will be available from the Government or, because the polluter should pay, from British Steel, to reclaim the steel sites and to ensure that that environment is in a fit condition to be used for further development of whatever sort. The cost will be considerable. In my view, responsibility should he squarely with British Steel but it, like any other concern, is not altruistic when money is needed to restore an area that it has abandoned. I hope that the Government will assure us today that they will make every effort to ensure that that responsibility is met by British Steel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, finance is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for regeneration. I welcome this additional money made available by the Government for Motherwell district and for the LDA, especially for 1992–93. However, that money was made available before the closure of Ravenscraig, because of the high level of redundancies that pertained, including those resulting from the closure of Clydesdale tube works. It was a recognition of the difficulties that we faced even before Ravenscraig closed. I hope that the fact that the Government have been relatively generous will not prevent them from recognising that the situation has become much worse since that money was made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend to the Government Motherwell district council's five-year plan for industrial and commercial development. I know from experience and discussion that the plan is not a negotiating position. The council has not put in an unrealistic bid. It has proposed a realistic, concrete plan for the development of industry in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the four aspects that I have mentioned, a psychological change is needed. The work force in Lanarkshire is capable of change and flexibility, as it has demonstrated. We must rid ourselves psychologically of the view that Lanarkshire is a heavy industrial area and can be only that. Lanarkshire is well placed for the development of business, commerce and services. It is a satellite of Glasgow, within its orbit and within reach of those who must work there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All parties—ourselves, the Government, the people of Lanarkshire and Strathclyde regional council, in both its attitude and its structure plans, must move away from the idea that we are dealing with the Lanarkshire of the 1890s. We are in the approach to the year 2000. There is potential there if we approach it in a spirit of partnership, as we have tried to do. No one is asking politicians to do everything; we ask the Government to play an enabling role, to assist the people of Lanarkshire to acquire the talent, dedication, determination, skills and flexibility to meet the challenges of the next century, because they are capable of doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
I welcome the orders as one step in that direction. I hope that the Government will also pay attention to the other issues raised this morning and will continue to give constructive assistance to the people of Lanarkshire for the future that they have earned and deserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Adam Ingrain 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Kilbride)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome and endorse the sentiments of my hon. Friends the Members for Monklands, West and for Motherwell, North. I have absented myself from a Select Committee this morning, which might prove the point made by other hon. Members that we are not discussing merely a parochial issue. This is a most important debate on what is happening in one part of Lanarkshire, because it will have an impact on wider Lanarkshire and on the Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish the enterprise zones every success. We must hope that they achieve their objectives. It has been said that anything is better than nothing, and there has been a dearth of Government policies for tackling major problems in the declining economy of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem has been that, although we have tried to develop our understanding and experience of enterprise zones, they do not always seem to work. I genuinely hope that the locality of the enterprise zones will have a net gain of 8,000 jobs. No timescale has been laid down. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's thoughts on how long it may take to achieve the objective. Knowing the struggling involved in securing jobs in communities and the benefits that have come to the new town of East Kilbride, I think that 8,000 new jobs is an amazing project for which to aim. I have my doubts about whether it will be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituency has benefited because it is in an area which since 1947, has developed as a new town corporation—although it is partly within the hub of the Glasgow-Lanarkshire area and the central belt. We have benefited from drawing people from the Lanarkshire conurbation and from Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it has taken 40 years to achieve that success and each week of those 40 years has been a struggle to maintain it. We did it because of large amounts of Government finance—taxpayers' money—being invested in infrastructure, job attraction, improved quality of fife, especially in housing, and a range of other things. I cannot see all that coming from the enterprise zone philosophy. If there is anything to be learnt from the new town experience, it is that it should be replicated; we should try to build upon it. I do not think that the enterprise zone philosophy will adapt the success lessons of the new towns and add to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There appears to be a contradiction in the Government's philosophy as it relates to Lanarkshire. They state that they are trying to create a new engine-room of economic regeneration but at the same time they announce that East Kilbride development corporation is to be wound up in the near future—without a coherent policy on what will take its place. When the Government produced their White Paper on the future of new towns, they stated that it was about maintaining momentum. But the momentum will come to a dead stop when the new town development corporation is wound up, because nothing will be put in its place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
That will have an immediate impact not just on East Kilbride or Lanarkshire, but on the wider Scottish economy. The majority of inward investment in Scotland comes to East Kilbride. The majority of new jobs are created within that community. The means by which that success has been achieved will be closed down and nothing will take its place. That will work against the Government's wishes for enterprise zones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Treasury diktat, assets will be sold off piecemeal. Industrial and commercial assets will be spread to the winds. There will be no future planning for the marketing of assets in the wider economic market place to take account of job attraction and other aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to understand this contradiction. The enterprise zones are to be the engine room of economic generation, while the East Kilbride development corporation is to be closed down. That is not a party political point. The new business forum in East Kilbride, which represents the wider commercial and industrial sectors, is deeply critical of the Government's policy. It refers not only to East Kilbride but to the wider Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must deal with those issues. No one is arguing for preferential treatment for East Kilbride for ever more. There is a genuine desire for the benefits and the lessons that we have learnt in the past 40 to 50 years to be applied to Lanarkshire to help that troubled economy and, as a consequence, to help the Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should build on success and not close it down. There is a good case for using the expertise of the new town development corporation staff in areas such as enterprise zones and in the wider Lanarkshire economy, to gain from their knowledge of the world market place to attract jobs to Scotland. The whole of Scotland would benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I plead with the Minister to take that request on board. It is not a partisan political point; it comes from the business community, too, which wants the Lanarkshire and the Scottish economy to succeed, but it does not believe that the Government have a strategy. The Government have a piecemeal, incoherent approach. I hope that the Minister will take the message of Opposition Members back to the Treasury and ask for something bigger and better, because Lanarkshire and the Scottish economy need it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a constructive debate. I accept that some Opposition Members must attend another important meeting. They have apologised and I understand if they need to slip out before I have wound up the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members welcome the enterprise zone orders and they are right to emphasise that we have to put Lanarkshire in context. Hon. Members speak for their constituencies, but it is not possible to divorce the Lanarkshire and the Lanarkshire enterprise zone from the rest of the Scottish economy. The hon. Member for Motherwell, North and others have made the point, with which I agree, that Lanarkshire has to be seen as a potential asset to the Scottish economy and not a disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Monklands, West, for Motherwell, North, for Motherwell, South and for
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Clydesdale raised the key question of the displacement of jobs resulting from the establishment of an enterprise zone. The hon. Member for Clydesdale, who spoke on his constituents' behalf with his customary vigour, was particularly interested in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fundamental to the enterprise zones policy to maximise the number of new jobs. I shall reassure hon. Members by saying that the strict management guidelines for the development of the enterprise zone—devised by the LDA with the local authorities—are designed to achieve that. It is good news that 60 per cent, of the jobs estimated to be involved in the early inquiries about the zone sites would be new jobs to Scotland. That relates to the question that the hon. Member for East Kilbride asked me about the timetable for the new jobs. It is estimated that they will be created over the life of the zone. Clearly, it would be possible to improve on that timescale if the zone were a success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The early signs are excellent. The enterprise zone has been in operation for less than two weeks and there is a possibility of 1,000 to 1,500 new jobs in the pipeline. We are confident of reaching the jobs target.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the jobs will be mainly in manufacturing. If I can obtain more detail, I shall let him know. The enterprise zone is designed principally for manufacturing jobs.

The choice of sites was heavily influenced by the scope for early development, in which the hon. Members for Motherwell, South was interested. The zone's attractiveness to industry is a key factor. We have had problems at sites elsewhere in achieving development, so we must remember that industry cannot be directed into the sites. Companies have to be attracted, particularly as the target is inward investors, who will examine sites in relation to their competitiveness compared with those elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the steel sites referred to by the hon. Member for Motherwell, South were not included in the enterprise zone sites. I assure him that that does not mean that they are being neglected. The LDA is having close, constructive discussions with British Steel to secure the reclamation and development of the sites, which are still owned by the company and are its responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Bray</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister deal specifically with the Lanarkshire works site? It is owned not by British Steel but by the Scottish Development Agency and has been for the past 10 years. It is on the main line and has obvious potential for a parkway-type development. Why has none of the potential been explored by the Scottish Office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that the site's potential is being explored, but we had to identify priority sites and ensure that sites met criteria laid down by the European Commission.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The European Commission agreed quickly to the enterprise zone proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members also raised the issues of finance and of general strategy. I must re-emphasise to the hon. Member for Motherwell, North that the extra finance was announced in the knowledge of the decisions about Ravenscraig. In the Lanarkshire working group's terms of remit, that was based on pessimistic assumptions about the steel closures that eventually occurred. As hon. Members have recognised, the resources have been considerable and have amounted to almost £150 million over and above existing resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In future, we must take into account the plans that have been put forward, such as those by the district councils for economic development. We hope to continue the priority that has been given in the capital allocations to economic development expenditure in Lanarkshire by local development authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Motherwell, South asked many detailed questions about roads. It might be convenient if I give detailed answers in a letter to him. As he suggested, there are conflicting considerations on some of the road developments to which he referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Kilbride, among others, asked about general strategy. We are intent on maintaining momentum. The hon. Gentleman accepted that new towns cannot be kept for ever, but we consider East Kilbride to be a major asset to Lanarkshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What will replace the development corporation board in looking after the residual assets that are not sold off to the private sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that we intend to use new town expertise. The development agency has already employed the new town under contract
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
to use the expertise of its staff. We are discussing with East Kilbride the possibilities of joint working, both before and after wind-up. The Government have asked all new towns to do that as part of the planned approach to wind-up. The hon. Gentleman referred to the East Kilbride business forum. I have met that forum; it is a constructive and forward-looking group with which we shall continue to have close contact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The action plan from the working group was a short-term series of individual projects. We shall develop the strategy, which will be made public, with the full co-operation of the local authorities in the next couple of months. The local authorities have signed partnership agreements with the LDA for the enterprise zone proposals. That is an important building block in the future of Lanarkshire. No doubt we shall have further opportunities to debate that future, but for the moment I welcome the generally positive approach of Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Motherwell, North said, this is not a partisan matter. We have tried to deal with the problems of Lanarkshire in a non-partisan way, and it is in that spirit that I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
