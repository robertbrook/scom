	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Charles Wardle)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Hong Kong (British Nationality) (Amendment) Order 1993.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, it will be convenient to discuss at the same time the other order before us, namely, the draft British Nationality (Hong Kong) (Selection Scheme) (Amendment) Order 1993.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subject to approval in this House and in another place, the first order will come into force on 3 January 1994 and the second on 21 July 1993. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I put the first order in context. As its title makes clear, it relates to the selection scheme that was provided for by the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The detailed arrangements governing the scheme were introduced by the British Nationality (Hong Kong) (Selection Scheme) Order 1990, which provided for applications for British citizenship to be made in tranches. Quotas were set for four classes of applicant:—the general occupational class, the disciplined service class, the sensitive service class—I shall not ask to which class, spiritually, the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) belongs—and the entrepreneurs class. The Act provided for up to 50,000 places to be made available to British nationals in the four classes and the various groups of which they were comprised. The scheme allows for points to be given for various attributes such as age, education and experience. Citizenship is given in the quota of those scoring most points. Some 39,500 of the 50,000 places were assigned for distribution under the first tranche, which started in December 1990 and finishes at the end of this year. Because of an element of under-subscription in some classes, just over 38,000 will be registered in the first tranche by the end of this year. The whole operation is running smoothly and we are well on target to complete the first tranche by 31 December 1993. As at 3 July, we had registered 31,568 principal beneficiaries, together with 52,876 dependants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next phase of the scheme will be the last. Four fifths of the places will have been allocated by then. There will be too few places left to warrant further phases and there will be too little time left for another phase after the second tranche applications have been processed. It seems to us that few people will leave it
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
until 1996 to emigrate if they have that intention and have, by then, secured such an insurance policy. The second and last phase will therefore begin on 3 January 1994 and will extend to 30 June 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new order makes relatively minor adjustments to the selection scheme in the light of experience in the first tranche. At first sight, hon. Members may find the detail of the order rather daunting, but its main purpose can be stated fairly simply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1990 order has been found to be rather rigid and the main aim of the new order is to modify certain provisions of the scheme to facilitate fair allocation of the remaining places. The order introduces the flexibility that will help us avoid over-provision of citizenship places among occupations in which demand has been lacking, and to allocate more places to areas in which demand has been strong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should perhaps confirm that the order does not make any special provision for the non-Chinese ethnic minorities in Hong Kong. As hon. Members will be aware, the future of that group was debated on the motion for the Adjournment on 9 July and I can only repeat what I said then: that the Government see no need to make any special citizenship provisions for them. Members of that group have always been free to apply, along with all other British Dependent Territory Citizens for British citizenship under the 1990 Act selection scheme and this remains the case. Last Friday, I took the opportunity to repeat once more the assurance that we have given on several occasions over the years, namely that if, contrary to all expectations, members of the non-Chinese ethnic minority in Hong Kong came under pressure to leave Hong Kong and had nowhere else to go, the Government of the day would be expected to consider, with considerable and particular sympathy, their case for entry into the United Kingdom. That assurance has been given in response to the special considerations affecting the non-Chinese ethnic minority, and it naturally does not extend to any other category. I should now like to say something about the changes that this order makes to the operation of the selection scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first tranche there was under-subscription in one or two categories, principally among private-sector managers and administrators, by about 4,250 places, but also among the police by some 150 places. It also appears that the number of qualified candidates in the sensitive service class and entrepreneurs class may turn out to be fewer than provided for in the quota. The order provides for places to be transferred from these categories to groups where they will be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is envisaged that any transfers between groups and/or classes will take place in a one-off exercise on a date to be specified by the Governor. That will probably be before completion of the processing of applications in the relevant group or class, but after the Hong Kong Government have established the size of the unused quota.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To assist with the general aim of matching more exactly supply and demand in the various categories,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0777">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
the order sets new quotas for individual groups that will take into account not only their total numbers and emigration rate, as before, but also their application rate in the first tranche. Half of the quota will be distributed by reference to emigration rates and half by reference to previous response, according to our experience in the first tranche.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The practical effect will be that those occupations that showed strong demand for places in the first tranche will have a correspondingly larger share of the quota for the second phase. The groups concerned include accountants and auditors, medical doctors and legal professionals in the general occupational class, and the army and immigration department in the disciplined services class. Conversely, those groups which have not been able to fill their quotas, such as managers, administrators and the police, will have proportionally fewer places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other changes to the scheme are more limited. Experience in the first tranche suggests that the current practice of limiting the number of points to be allocated for exceptional merit or outstanding achievement awards—whether occupation-related or for voluntary work or acts of bravery—has not been fair to applicants with records of long voluntary service or outstanding achievements. The order, therefore, raises those limits by 20–30 points so that such achievements will attract up to 50 points. The order also attaches somewhat more importance to public or community service. Extremely few applicants have managed to score any meaningful number of points under this heading and the order adjusts that slightly. Provision is made for service as a non-official justice of the peace to count as public or community service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order makes a number of other adjustments to the schedule, which are all technical and which I need mention only briefly. It removes the sub-quota for "managers and administrators" in the civil service. Experience has shown that the distinction between them and their counterparts—managers in the private sector—has turned out to be unnecessary. The order puts them on exactly the same footing. Experience has also shown that the earnings scale used under the scheme does not differentiate applicants sufficiently and has resulted in too much bunching around particular levels. The order corrects that. It also provides for recent changes in accountancy professional qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One change that we propose to make that does not require amendment of the original order is the inclusion of librarians in the scheme. This group has a high emigration rate, their service is one of high value and their services are in great demand. Since they have been emigrating and cannot easily be replaced it is right that they should now be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the second order, which sets out a scheme for registering British dependent territory citizens as British nationals overseas—that is, BN(O)s as opposed to BDTCs. This is less complicated than the first order, but has aroused a certain amount of con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
cern in Hong Kong, which I hope the recent decision on passports made by my right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary has served to allay. I shall say a little more on that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the second order is to ensure the orderly and timely acquisition of BDTC and BN(O) status by those who wish to acquire it before Hong Kong reverts to China in 1997. BDTC status expires at that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986 provides for Hong Kong BDTC status to end on 1 July 1997. It also provides for Hong Kong BDTCs to acquire BN(O) status and passports before that date. Under the terms of the memorandum attached to the joint declaration and article 4(2) of the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986, we cannot process applications for BN(O) status after 30 June 1997. So far only 0.5 million of the estimated 3.3 million BDTCs who are—or will be—eligible for BN(O) status have obtained BN(O) passports. There are some 1.7 million BDTC passports in circulation, of which more than half are due to expire in 1996–97. Unless we act not, many of those eligible will apply very close to 1997, and the Hong Kong immigration department will not have the capacity to process their applications before the 30 June deadline. There would clearly be a serious problem if significant numbers of applications remained unprocessed after the deadline had passed. We therefore wish to institute a phased programme of BN(O) registrations to encourage an orderly flow and avoid an overwhelming number of last minute applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important consideration is that those who wish to become BN(O)s have first to acquire BDTC status. Naturalisation as a BDTC normally takes about 18 months in Hong Kong. There is, at present, no time limit on applications. In theory, eligible people may apply at any time in the run up to 30 June 1997—the handover point. However, it is clear that time is needed to process first the BDTC application and then, the BN(O) application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that legally binding cut-off dates for the acquisition of both BDTC and BN(O) status are the only way to ensure that people who are eligible for BN(O) status can acquire it, if they so wish. Without legal deadlines, we can see not incentive for people to apply in good time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme for achieving that aim is set out in the draft order. It is similar in concept to an exercise that Hong Kong undertook in relation to identity cards, with cut-off dates being set by age group. The order provides for cut-off dates for different age groups, at three to five month intervals. They start this October for 22 to 26-year-olds and finish in September 1997 for children born up to 30 June that year. Those children have to be registered by the end of the year. The Governor would have discretion to accept late applications in cases in which applicants became BDTCs after their BN(O) cut-off date or where applicants had other good reasons for not applying by their cut-off
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
date. The Governor has proposed to set up an appeal panel to deal with any late cases that the immigration department refused. This is being discussed with the Hong Kong Legislative Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the need to ensure sufficient time to naturalise those who wish to become BDTCs and subsequently BN(O)s we have made provision in the order for a single cut-off date—31 March 1996—for the acquisition of BDTC status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Articles 2(2) and 2(3) of the schedule to the Hong Kong Act 1985 provide the legal means to take such action, which, in our view, is essential if we are to deal with the transitional problem in an orderly fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I mentioned earlier, the proposals caused some concern in Hong Kong, particularly among members of the Legislative Council. They were unhappy about the removal of the right to become a BN(O) up to 30 June 1997. Most important in their view was that applicants should be able to retain their BDTC status right up to the 1997 deadline. While there was never any question of applicants losing BDTC status, my right hon. and learned Friend has met these concerns by allowing applicants to retain visible evidence of that status in the form of a BDTC passport when they register as BN(O)s and acquire a BN(O) passport. On this basis I am pleased to say that the legislative councillors have withdrawn their objections to the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend both orders to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.44 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Jones, to the Committee. It is the first time that I shall serve under your Chairmanship. I look forward to it, and hope that this is the first of many such occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister sought to portray the orders as almost entirely technical. The Opposition disagree with that assessment. The orders are most important: they are the culmination of a long process of British withdrawal from Hong Kong over a period of 10 years or more—since the former right hon. Member for Finchley, now Lady Thatcher, paid her famous visit to China. We are in the end-game of a sensitive, delicate phase in that process. This may be the last time that the House can debate the issues, even on a technical basis, before Hong Kong finally returns to the Republic of China.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We owe a debt of honour to many people who are still in Hong Kong. Many severe practical problems are involved in the issue of British citizenship: documents, travel documents, passports and so on. That is why I draw attention to the fact that we are discussing a matter of such great importance and sensitivity in Committee rather than on the Floor of the House. People who are thousands of miles from us will be affected. It is a classic case for flexibility in the procedures of the House: we should take expert evidence from members of the Legislative Council in Hong
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Kong and others on how they want the process to be handled and how they feel that it has been handled so far. Therefore, on a point of order, Mr. Jones, would it be appropriate for the Committee to adjourn so that you can consider whether we should take the extraordinary step of calling witnesses before the Committee before we conclude our consideration of the orders?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's request, but there are no grounds on which I could accept a motion to adjourn the Committee</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I accept that ruling, Mr. Jones. However, to consider this matter in less than an hour and a half pays scant respect to the thousands of people in Hong Kong who depend on the outcome of the Committee's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those people are living in the shadow of Tiananmen square. They are waiting for their island, their dependancy, to be taken over by the communist regime in the Republic of China. They are labouring under the shadow of the failure of British Governments of all political colours in the past 10 or 20 years properly to provide a system of democratic control to enable them to have some influence on the decisions that will affect them in the next few years. There have been belated and welcome attempts to democratise Hong Kong, often without great support from the business community in Hong Kong. If the process of democratisation had been started many years ago when it was apparent that the lease on Hong Kong was running out, people in Hong Kong would be in a far better position than they are now to take decisions to control their own destiny. We are administering the last rites for the citizens of Hong Kong. It behoves us to take the matter seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The orders amend two Acts: the Hong Kong Act 1985 and the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990. The Government heralded the orders as mainly administrative, but the amendment of the 1985 Act will restrict access to British national overseas—BN(O)—status. Neither instrument provides a nationality for the non-Chinese ethnic minorities in Hong Kong after 1999. That case has been argued strongly at every stage of discussions on Hong Kong since 1985. I hope that the Minister will take this chance to make a number of points for the record, which will be read carefully by our colleagues on the Legislative Council in Hong Kong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first instrument deals with the registration of citizens of British dependent territories as British nationals overseas. In mid-May 1993, the Chair of the members of the Legislative Council wrote to inform me of the Hong Kong Government's request to the British Government to introduce an Order in Council to amend the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986. The proposed amendments would impose cut-off dates for the registration of citizens of British dependent territories—BDTCs—as British nationals overseas—BN(O)s. After 31 March 1996, Hong Kong people will no longer be able to apply to become BDTCs. There is also a sliding scale of dates, determined by the potential applicant's date of birth, after
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0779">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
which BDTCs from Hong Kong will not be able to apply for a passport as British nationals overseas. That breaks an assurance made at the time of the discussion of the order that everyone who wanted to would be entitled to apply for that status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order also introduces a time limit for applications for BDTC status from Hong Kong people. That status is the necessary passport for obtaining BN(O) status. As the Minister said, about half of the people resident in Hong Kong are not at present BDTCs but may gain the right to apply after five years' residence or after three years' residence following marriage to a person with BDTC status. Such people now have to apply for registration on or before 31 March 1996. That is less than three years ahead and only 15 months before Hong Kong reverts to China. Many people who would have qualified to apply will be deprived of the opportunity and will not be able to retain any British status after 1 July 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order proposes a ridiculously short timetable for application for BN(O) status. People are divided according to date of birth: those born between 1967 and 1971 must apply before 30 October 1993. That means that young people born between those years have less than four months left in which to apply before the order comes into force. People aged between 22 and 26 are the least likely to be thinking about the future yet have the least time in which to make the decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order provides that an application made after the stipulated date may be accepted if there are "special circumstances" to justify registration. In the Hong Kong context, that is not especially reassuring. I shall return to the question of special circumstances a little later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The detailed bureaucratic regulation of applications will not bolster confidence in Hong Kong's future or stability. While it is good that the Home Office is thinking ahead to avoid a possible rush of applications near the deadline, as happened in the United Kingdom at the end of 1982 and 1987 as a result of the British Nationality Act 1981, it would be more sensible to solve the problem through greater publicity of the application dates and the appointment of more staff to deal with applications nearer to 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Very often in Committee debates along this Corridor, hon. Members find that they end up asking Home Office Ministers to take adequate steps to provide sufficient staff to perform a particular task. I remember debating the Asylum Bill with the Minister, and we discussed the delay in processing asylum applications. Much of that delay was caused by the Government's unwillingness to employ enough staff at the appropriate time. The same problem arises, with the same Department, in connection with this order. The proposal to deal with the problem by restricting people's rights to apply, rather than by making adequate provision for the applications, is wholly inappropriate, unjust and, I am sad to say, typical of the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is well understood that both the British and Hong Kong Governments should ensure that there is no
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
overwhelming rush for the new BN(O) documents and that there should be a well-managed system for processing and distributing BN(O) documents, however, members of the Legislative Council, many Hong Kong people and Members of Parliament are worried that this administrative measure may do more harm than good. For example, Mrs. Elsie Tu, Chair of the members of the Legislative Council, pointed out that under the phased programme proposed by the Hong Kong Government those who fail to apply within the specified period will lose their right to apply for registration as BN(O)s. Given that people already feel profoundly insecure about their future in this exceptional moment of Hong Kong's history, it is thoroughly unfair that the Order in Council should add to their sense of unease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, the order amends the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986 by adding "a safeguard" after article 4(3). The additional paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An application for registration under paragraph (2) above made after the relevant date may be accepted if the applicant shows that there are special circumstances which justify his being so registered."</p></blockquote>
That is a highly qualified discretionary power to be vested with the Home Secretary and his Ministers. It may sound sensible and reassuring, but the proposed measure raises a number of problems. I should be grateful if the Minister would deal with these later when he speaks and use the opportunity afforded by this debate to come back on some specific points that have been raised not just by Members in this place, but by members of the Hong Kong Legislature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there are no suggestions or explanations about what will be considered as "special circumstances". Perhaps the Minister will put one or two of those on the record today, so that people in Hong Kong may have an idea about what that vague phrase means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the structure for consideration of late applications has not been explained. What will be the structure for considering late applications? That information would be useful, especially for those in Hong Kong who may seek to avail themselves of that facility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, is there a cut-off date for those cases? It is all very well having special circumstances and a discretion, but when would that terminate? Would it be the day when the handover takes place? Is there a more advanced date than that? When is the very last point at which people will be forced into a decision that will affect them and their families—their children and grandchildren—for the rest of their lives? Such a decision must be taken with all due care and with the fullest possible knowledge of the respective dates to be employed by the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally on this section, who will be entrusted with the role and powers to reconsider cases? Given the debates that we have had in other spheres on asylum and immigration and the abolition of the right of appeal in certain cases, it is absolutely essential that individuals in Hong Kong are wholly aware of their rights in respect of asking for cases to be reconsidered. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0780">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
criteria that will be employed in reconsidering those cases are a fundamental aspect of that problem. What will be the criteria for reconsidering individual cases? It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify the issue of reconsidering cases and the criteria that will be applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the director of immigration will exercise his discretion to accept late applications under special circumstances and I understand that other proposals are being discussed by the Governor of Hong Kong and the Legislative Council. However, none of that justifies what Mrs. Elsie Tu calls the "premature deprivation" of the rights of British Dependent Territory Citizens to register for BN(O) status any time before 1 July 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order seems ill-suited to the needs of Hong Kong people who seek guidance, help and a sense of security from the Governor and the British Government. What they do not need is a further directive that does little to reassure them about their rights and their position in an already confusing bureaucratic maze. The Minister alluded to the algebraic equations in the order which I do not pretend to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive simply adds to public concern by imposing a guillotine on essential decisions by the people of Hong Kong. Those who do not apply before July 1997 should not be denied their right to BN(O) status because they did not apply within the time limit that the 'Government have imposed without consulting them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are ways of introducing administrative changes that would create a system to help the Hong Kong authorities without imposing strict rules and giving ambiguous, vague assurances. Members of the Legislative Council have asked that the Governor and the United Kingdom Government approach them for help and consultation. We have attempted in our own, minor way this morning to ensure that their voice is heard through the British parliamentary process rather than through delegations and faxes, in the belief that it would be useful to have something on public record. I realise that that is not possible in the context of a statutory instrument Committee. We support the option and ask the Government to consider it rather than plough straight through with an Order in Council. The Government must try to help the people of Hong Kong through the Committee by co-operation rather than threats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Nationality (Hong Kong) (Selection Scheme) (Amendment) Order 1993 provides, as the Minister said, for the second tranche of applications made under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990 for registration of people as British citizens. The Act provides for up to 50,000 BDTCs and their spouses and minor children to register as British citizens, therefore to gain the right of abode in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The detailed points scheme was set up to decide on applications. There have been many fewer applications so far than were expected. It is possible that the full 50,000 quota may not be reached under the initial
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
scheme. Perhaps the Minister wishes to comment on that. Does he want the full quota to be reached so that he can reject people who might be entitled to British citizenship on merit, under the points scheme, or does he think it useful to leave some slack in the System? It would be helpful to be told. I am mindful of the Minister's own remarks about the number of Bosnian refugees who should be allowed here, and of the failure of both the Government and the Bosnian authorities to identify the minimal number we agreed to take—I believe it was 1,000 plus relatives—which we still have not reached eight months after the Minister's first statement. I hope that our planning is set for us to reach the 50,000 by the given date. Otherwise, can the Minister explain the Government's thinking about the issuing of the full 50,000 passports?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order makes complicated amendments to the criteria for deciding about registration and adds points to certain categories, thus making it more likely that the quota will be filled. It does not provide for those people who will have no nationality in Hong Kong to be covered by the scheme, if they so wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for providing up-to-date figures. The latest I had were for 19 June this year, at which time 66,734 applications had been received from principal applicants for the 50,000 passports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the first tranche.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. There were 30,762 principal beneficiaries registered as British citizens, with 51,127 dependants. The Minister's figures were correct at 1 July. I believe that he said that 31,568 had been registered. That is a slightly more up-to-date figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to those who advocate incorporating the non-Chinese ethnic minorities that the figures are made clear. This will enable us to see what leeway exists, even within the current quota, to ensure some security for those people. The Government may object on the ground that that would distort the economic and social purpose of the 50,000 schedule, but we shall come to that soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned that the Government have done nothing in the order to take account of the worries of the non-Chinese ethnic minorities who are BDTCs of Hong Kong, nor anything during the process of handing the colony back to China. As a result, I have had many representations from organisations in Hong Kong asking whether the Government could be persuaded to offer greater assurance to the non-Chinese ethnic minority population there. Many of the Chinese population will be offered Chinese passports, and will have a right to them, but a small group has lived in Hong Kong for many years and is not of Chinese origin. Some are Asian, some Eurasian and some White Russians. They could be stateless if they were left without British citizenship, which would allow them right of abode.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The history of the non-Chinese ethnic minorities in Hong Kong goes back to 1981 when the British flag was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0781">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
raised over the colony. Many of the non-Chinese ethnic minority went to Hong Kong precisely because it was under British administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the Legislative Council, there are now 7,000 people of non-Chinese origin—2,000 families—holding BDTC passports. The ethnic minority population—largely Indian and Pakistani—have established in Hong Kong a community that is highly respected for its social and economic contribution to the colony's development. Many play essential roles in creating Hong Kong's wealth: many are major employers and senior figures in finance and Government. In 1985, it was estimated that the Indian population—0.5 per cent. of the colony's population—contributed 10 per cent. towards its wealth. That information appeared in 
	<i>The Independent</i> of 27 January.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a strong case for offering the non-Chinese ethnic minority the right of abode. After the transfer of sovereignty in 1997, the non-Chinese ethnic minorities will effectively become stateless. They will have no guarantee of right of abode in Hong Kong even though they have lived there for many years, as they will not automatically hold Chinese citizenship. Furthermore, the Chinese authorities consider that BN(O) documents to be no more than travel documents. So, in terms of having right of abode and a place that they call their own, their current papers will be next to useless in the eyes of the Chinese and British Governments. The British Government give them similar treatment, since, effectively, they will not entitle affected minorities to the right of abode in the United Kingdom or in any British dependent territory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The BN(O) documents will not be transferable to future generations, although the next two generations will be eligible for British overseas citizen status. After that time, those people—grandchildren and families—will be stateless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Hong Kong Legislative Council and the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs in 1989 argued that the British Government have a moral and legal responsibility to provide proper—British—citizenship to non-ethnic Chinese BDTC minorities. The Select Committee was adamant that the Government should provide British citizenship for the non-Chinese ethnic minority, as it believed that the Chinese authorities, once in Hong Kong, would at best create second-class citizenship for those people. The Select Committee said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is not only statelessness that these minorities risk. It has been pointed out to us that identity cards already being issued by the Hong Kong Government have three small stars to indicate Chinese origin. The writer comments 'I and my family are of European origin and are now coded separately from the bulk of the residents of Hong Kong. I am not entitled to … the full benefits of Hong Kong or Chinese nationality'. Furthermore, the draft Basic Law specifically prohibits non-Chinese from becoming Chief Executive, or from filling senior civil service and police posts. We believe that the British Government has an obligation to provide proper citizenship (ie British citizenship) to this group … which it has co-operated in consigning otherwise to a second class citizenship."</p></blockquote>
We have received verbal assurances from Ministers that if ethnic minorities are denied the right of abode in
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
or are forced to leave Hong Kong, the Government would look sympathetically into their cases to come to the United Kingdom. In 1986, the then Minister of State at the Home Office, Mr. Waddington, stated in the House of Commons:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the unlikely event of any British nationals being forced to leave Hong Kong and having nowhere to go, we have made it clear that we would expect the Government of the day to consider sympathetically whether to admit such people on a case-by-case basis in the light of particular circumstances."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 January 1986; Vol. 89, c. 1303.]</p></blockquote>
It is worth dismembering that statement, which was probably made with great care, because a few aspects of it give us cause for concern. The then Minister referred to people "having nowhere to go". Theoretically, many of them may be able to go to India, Pakistan or wherever their distant origins lie. Thus the United Kingdom may not be an initial choice or option because the United Kingdom Government will probably direct the ethnic minorities of Hong Kong towards other states instead of taking that responsibility themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The former Minister of State also said that the Government of the day would "consider sympathetically whether to admit" those people. If individuals of British nationality are forced out of the country, in times of crisis they should surely expect the British Government to accept them without qualification or reservation. We should look back to the appalling treatment meted out by Idi Amin to the Ugandan Asians and the proper response of the Government at that time. The qualifications to "consider sympathetically whether to admit" such people allows the Government to pick and choose or, at worst, refuse every case. Considering the Government's recent record on and attitude to such cases, it is doubtful whether they would, in fact, be likely to look at those cases sympathetically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"A case by case basis" for decision making is simply not a guarantee to the central concern: the position of a group of Hong Kong's population who may be treated adversely as a distinct second class of citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, this verbal assurance is not enough and the Government know that they could do better. Having taken some time to outline my case—which includes the concerns of many individuals in Hong Kong, and in the United Kingdom, and many representations from the Legislative Council in Hong Kong—I hope that the Minister will have a chance to consider the points raised and to reply to them for the benefit of not merely those on the Committee but those in Hong Kong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suggest, therefore, that the Government amend their recommendation in the Order in Council and consider either reforming the selection scheme so that ethnic minorities are not left stateless or introducing a scheme that will treat ethnic minorities as a group of people deserving special and humane consideration. It would be a shame indeed if the Government did not offer the ethnic minorities of Hong Kong, who have a long-standing tie with the United Kingdom, more security than BN(O) or BOC status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0782">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
We do not pretend to lay down a scheme to which the Government should say yea or nay at the moment. None the less, I hope that the Minister will accept that the representations that he and the Home Secretary have received come from a genuine and deep concern among the 2,000 or so families of ethnic minorities in Hong Kong. Their concern is about not only their future in 1997, but their children's grandchildren's future for generations to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we withdraw from Hong Kong, we must make proper provision for those who live there and, in respect of families of ethnic minorities, that provision is nothing less than a debt of honour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In replying to the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, I hope that you, Mr. Jones, will not think that I am straying out of order if I comment on Bosnia. The hon. Gentleman saw a read across to Bosnia and said that the take-up of the 1,000 places offered by the British Government late last year was not yet completed. He is absolutely right. He attributed that fact either to the British Government or to the authorities in the former Yugoslavia—the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. For the sake of clarity, I should like to make it clear that the selection of individuals to fill those places is entirely a matter for UNHCR. The hon. Gentleman is right that all places have not been taken up. He might also be aware that I suggested to UNHCR that it expands the definition of people qualifying for those 1,000 places, so that more places may soon be taken up by deserving individuals. I perceive, Mr. Jones, that you have not ruled me out of order. I shall, therefore, come smartly back to the question of Hong Kong. I am grateful to you for allowing me that amount of freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke about flexibility. It is worth remembering that both statutory instruments—as I sought to make clear at the start—follow directly from the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990 and the selection scheme order of 1990, which set the ground rules for the first tranche. The hon. Gentleman raised a point of order about input from the Legislative Council. The point of order is not something on which I would venture to comment, but when the Bill that became the 1990 Act was going through Parliament, there was vigorous representation and lobbying—quite rightly so. Since then, members of the Legislative Council and other people in Hong Kong and throughout the world have made representations both to the British Government and to the Governor of Hong Kong. The representations have continued and have been carefully borne in mind by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter of ethnic minorities seems to be the one that concerns the hon. Gentleman the most. In my opening remarks, I mentioned that that issue had been the subject of a debate on Friday. I would not wish to test your patience, Mr. Jones, or the patience of the Committee, by repeating everything that is in columns 647 to 652 of 
	<i>Hansard</i> for 9 July, but I shall refer to three or four key points that were raised in the debate about ethnic minorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will do so briefly, Mr. Jones. As I told the House last Friday, the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Joint Declaration and article 24(6) of the Basic Law guarantee the ethnic minorities in Hong Kong a right of abode in Hong Kong … The Peking authorities have said that people in Hong Kong who are not ethnically Chinese are welcome to remain and that it is open to them to apply for Chinese citizenship."</p></blockquote>
That is why
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government remain firmly of the view that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to introduce legislation to give the ethnic minorities British citizenship. They are, of course, free, along with all other BDTCs to apply for British citizenship under the selection scheme which was set up under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 9 July 1993; Vol. 228, c.650–651.]</p></blockquote>
The Government see no case for further action on the matter. The hon. Gentleman referred to assurances that have been given in the past, and I repeated those assurances in the debate in the House last Friday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman cut-off dates and suggested that people should be allowed to be free of such disciplined procedure. We are dealing with large numbers of people and the cut-off dates have been set for reasons of good order and efficiency. They will serve the people who wish to make the applications and will bolster their rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman, understandably, expressed concern about the "special circumstances" that would allow a person to ask for an application to be considered even though the date by which the application should have been submitted had passed. Any sensible reasons that prevented an application from being made in time—such as ill health or absence from Hong Kong—undoubtedly will be considered by those monitoring the appeals and, ultimately, by the Governor. Those special circumstances are built into the order to provide just the safeguards that the hon. Gentleman has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talked about staffing. I can assure him that the number of Home Office staff who have been seconded for this exercise is up to scratch. The Hong Kong Government have also played their part correctly. The scheme is going according to plan. It is clear that applications for the first tranche will be completed by the end of this calendar year, by which time just over 38,000 of the 50,000 places will have been allocated. The hon. Gentleman was right to say that the number of applications for that first tranche was just over 66,000. The number remaining for the second tranche, as determined by our proceedings today, will be slightly fewer than 12,000, or slightly more than 20 per cent. of the total number of places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman agreed that the formula involved somewhat algebraic technicalities. Their purpose is simply to reflect as accurately as possible the patterns of emigration and the corresponding demand for places so that the system can be operated as fairly as possible. The hon. Gentleman said that the Legislative
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0783">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Council was still uneasy about the cut-off dates. My impression is that the recent assurances from my right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary have caused that unease to abate. People understand the need for an orderly procedure to make the exercise work properly for the people in Hong Kong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that the Government have given assurances for the ethnic minorities, and I commend to hon. Members the debate in 
	<i>Hansard</i> of 9 July. For those reasons, I recommend the orders to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.24 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may come back on a couple of specific points, Mr. Jones. The Minister may wish either to respond to them or to undertake to write to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first issue relates to the five years' residence that is needed to gain BDTC status in the first place. The end date for BN(O) applications is 15 months before Hong Kong is handed to the Chinese. That will effectively prevent as many as half the Hong Kong residents currently without BDTC status from gaining their BN(O) status under that schedule. That is a matter of concern to a number of people in Hong Kong. It is a technical question, but one that requires a practical answer. Many people may want to start the process, but the timescale would preclude them from gaining BN(O) status by the appropriate date. If it is more helpful for the Minister to drop me a line about that, I should appreciate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final question on that subject was, I believe, about who would be entrusted with making the decisions to consider late applications. If someone has missed out all along the line, what would the process be? I referred to the structure for applying. Who would be in charge of that? What would be the criteria for those reconsidered cases Again, that is something of a mouthful, and I should not necessarily expect the Minister to answer immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I floated an idea about the number of British citizenships available. The Minister has been very helpful in providing up-to-date figures. It appears that there is leeway, even within the 50,000 British citizenships available, to make some provision for ethnic minorities. I do not propose that he does that, but request him to consider whether it is one way to deal with this difficult problem—we have some responsibility towards this significant but numerically small group of people—and whether they could be accommodated within the 50,000. Does the Minister feel that that might blow the basis of the scheme for the 50,000, which is on clearly written if not immediately understandable criteria? Or, could an additional provision, wholly outwith the 50,000, accommodate those individuals from ethnic minorities? I am sure that they would look forward with great anticipation to the Minister's answer. For the purposes of this Committee, I do not want the Minister to feel that he must immediately give a comprehensive answer. However, a full
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
answer would be helpful and, if that means my corresponding with him, I should be more than happy to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for his remarks and the clarification that he has given so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.27 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raised three questions, with the third part being divided perhaps into "a" and "b".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The BDTC applications were mentioned. As the hon. Gentleman knows, that exercise ends on 31 March 1996. There must be a cut-off date. There is, of course, a deadline in terms of the transfer date, which has been known for successive generations. For that reason and for good order, we must work within deadlines. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman to amplify that point, but that is the essence of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The composition of the appeal panel is still to be decided. Ultimately, the Governor will appoint people to the panel. I shall ensure that the hon. Gentleman is given any further information about the panel as it develops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talked of leeway in the 50,000 places. I describe that as his question 3a. His question 3b requested additional places to the 50,000 that are proposed. Grasshopperwise, I shall first tackle question 3b. Any additional places would require new primary legislation. The 1990 Act was required to provide for the 50,000 places. The Government can see no need for another such exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Gentleman talked about leeway, he was right to say that some late slack in the scheme is likely to occur. However, that slack will be redistributed within the scheme according to the formula that we have devised. I remind the hon. Gentleman that ethnic minorities, on behalf of whom he spoke so forcefully, were free to apply in the first tranche. They will be eligible to apply in the second tranche. A different category for ethnic minorities will not be established within the slack at the last minute. I have already explained the reasons for that to the Committee. Those reasons are also set out in 
	<i>Hansard</i> of 9 July.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to finish with one general point. The circumstances that we are discussing are probably unique, even in Britain's imperial and colonial history. To seek to hand a dependent territory back to the nation from which it was leased many years ago is unique. In view of that, I ask the Minister and his colleagues to be flexible. We have not found the solution to the problem. The problem cannot be dispatched, or put on the shelf and left. It will probably remain for the duration of the current Administration. Perhaps we shall have an election before July 1997, but a new regime, or a different party, will not have been in power for long at that time. Therefore, the circumstances are the unique responsibility of this Government.

As the process unfolds during the next year or two several anomalies will become apparent. We must respond to them flexibly and with an open mind, especially in view of the delicate negotiations that are taking place with the Republic of China, and the internal pressures on communities in Hong Kong. I make a general plea: I ask the Minister to bear in mind that the responsibility is onerous and not to believe that the problem has been solved. I hope that he will respond as difficulties arise. I am sure that he wishes to do the best for individuals in Hong Kong to whom we owe so much. The Opposition offer him full co-operation in obtaining the best possible settlement for those who live in Hong Kong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
