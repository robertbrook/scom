	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Dioxins) (England) (No. 2) (Revocation) Order 1992 (S.I., 1992, No. 3188).</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Nicholas Soames)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Committee will be aware, this order lifts the restrictions previously imposed on a farm in Derbyshire because the concentrations of dioxin present in some of its food products have now fallen to acceptable levels. The restrictions originally imposed last March prohibited the breeding of food animals, the movement on to and off the farm of animals, crops and any food derived from those animals and the movement off the farm of food and feed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that hon. Members share my satisfaction that it has now proved possible to lift those restrictions. Resolution of this difficult problem has involved a careful and thorough scientific investigation by the Ministry and its satisfactory conclusion owes much to the dedication and skill of those involved. But it has depended, too, on the co-operation and active assistance of the farmers involved and of their two neighbours who were affected by non-statutory restrictions on the sale of their milk. I shall say more about those farmers later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help the Committee if I rehearse past events. Dioxins are ubiquitous environmental contaminants produced as unwanted by-products of incinerators, other combustion processes and certain industrial processes. The problem near Bolsover was first identified by the extensive programme of surveillance which my Department has been carrying out as a follow-up to the publication of a Government paper—"Dioxins in the Environment"—which was published in 1989. The results of the testing programme showed that exposure to dioxins in foods for the population as a whole were well below international safety limits. The full results were given in the paper on food surveillance which was published in January last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Testing for dioxins has paid particular regard to milk as the major potential route of dietary exposure
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
and a useful monitor of environmental contamination. In June 1991, our programme revealed elevated levels of dioxins in the supplies of milk from two adjacent farms near Bolsover. There was no risk to health from these supplies because they were routinely bulked with other supplies prior to sale to the public. Nevertheless the contamination was clearly unacceptable and the Milk Marketing Board took immediate action to prevent milk from these farms from entering the public supply. Further testing in the area identified a third farm where levels were also high. However, in that case the farmer was operating a suckler cow herd and no milk was sold for public consumption. There was therefore no need to place a prohibition order on any of the three farms in relation to milk production as no risk to public health existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem was discussed with the farmers, who readily agreed to assist in the comprehensive research programme on milk, meat, herbage and soil from the area, which was immediately put in train. It was of course essential that no livestock should be moved from the holdings while that research was being carried out. The farmers were fully involved in the research and monthly payments were made to them both for their participation in the programme and also in recognition of the considerable disruption to their farming activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The results of the research programme were published in March 1992.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the compensation moneys were paid, under which provisions in what legislation were the payments made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The moneys were paid not as compensation but for the work with which the farmers assisted us and in recognition of the interruption to their farming activities. It was made clear to the farmers that the payments were not compensation. Perhaps I may return to the matter because the hon. Gentleman may wish to pursue it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Skinner 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bolsover)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be fair to say that at the time it was embarrassing for the Government for the two farmers, and later three, to be put out of work? They had lost their livelihoods and had made claims for compensation which the Government would not meet, so the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food found a device to pay money to the farmers in the hope that they would keep their mouths shut. The payments were supposedly to cover research but were sufficient to satisfy the National Farmers Union, which had not then decided to sue Coalite, but has now done so. The payments may have been loosely connected with research, but in truth were an attempt to silence the farmers. Thank goodness they had more sense and kept shouting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may choose that interpretation, but that is not what happened. The moneys were paid to the farmers in recognition of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
assistance that they gave to the research programme and of the considerable disruption in their activities. The hon. Gentleman knows that there is no possibility of shutting up farmers in his constituency or elsewhere, and there was no intention of doing so. The fanners' views were robustly represented by the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) and the delegation which he brought to me, and on other occasions. We were fully aware of what they thought. I believe that the farmers accept that we have dealt with the matter honourably throughout.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give us a schedule of the payments that were made to the farmers, with headings of expenditure which they might have incurred in helping the research programme? I ask that because the Minister may remember a debate on lead in geese and the argument about payments when farmers lose income following declaration of areas under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985. I am trying to work out whether there is consistency in the Government's approach. Will the Minister publish the figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, as my hon. Friends know, everything that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food does is consistent. The hon. Member for Workington will not be able to find any inconsistency, but I shall discuss the matter with my advisers to see whether it will be possible to provide the information. I shall write to him about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no comparison with that famous discussion about lead in geese and the poor gentleman in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) who had such an unfortunate experience. The pollution in that case was clear and was discovered very quickly. We are discussing the serious matter of dioxins, analysis of which is difficult and requires meticulous and long-term scientific work. I shall write in detail to the hon. Member for Workington about the basis on which we dealt with the matter and how we came to our conclusion, and I shall send a copy of that letter to the hon. Member for Bolsover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem was discussed with the farmers concerned, who readily agreed to the research, which was published in 1992 and which revealed unusually high levels of dioxins in the samples of meat from one farm. An order was introduced to ensure that consumers were not exposed to unacceptable levels of dioxins in food from the farm. When the first order lapsed in June the House debated a replacement order. The order revoking that second dioxins order is the subject of today's debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scientific evidence showed that the levels of dioxins in the meat from the other two farms represented no health risk and that, therefore, it was not necessary for sales of livestock to be prohibited. Results from the analysis of soil samples taken by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food supported the conclusion that the potential problem with livestock was restricted to one farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
We always intended to lift the emergency order and other restrictions as soon as it was safe so that the farmers could resume their normal business. Analysis of samples of the produce from the three affected farms was therefore continued throughout the summer and autumn. The results showed that dioxin concentration in the milk samples from the two diary farms had, by August 1992, fallen below the maximum tolerable concentration previously set by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Health. That result was confirmed by samples taken in October and, in addition, the dioxin concentration of the meat from animals on the farm on which the order had been placed had also fallen significantly to levels found earlier in animals from the other farms. In view of those findings, the Milk Marketing Board agreed to accept supplies from the two dairy farms. The Department of Health concluded that meat and offal from the third farm was safe for consumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was, therefore, delighted to be able to inform the House on 16 December 1992 that the emergency order would be lifted and that food produced by all three farms was once more safe to consume. He also announced that a full report of the investigations would be placed in the Library.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having briefly reviewed the history of the incident, I should like to deal with more general points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I should like to emphasise the prompt action taken by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to ensure that there was no risk to the public food supply. All the completed studies confirm our original assessment that the problem was highly localised. The research undertaken by the Ministry has been complemented by work of Her Majesty's inspectorate of pollution and the National Rivers Authority. None of those studies suggested that there was any risk to public health. We have identified and satisfactorily resolved a potential problem with food safety. However, we are never complacent about the safety of food and shall continue to keep the situation under the closest surveillance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I should like to emphasise again the crucial part in the successful programme that was played by the farmers. Their businesses, indeed their very lives, were turned upside down by the discovery of the contamination, but they reacted positively to the challenge of investigating the extent of the threat and ensured that detailed information was produced to evaluate and to combat the problem. They readily and willingly changed their feeding practices, retained animals that would otherwise have been destroyed, collected milk samples on our behalf and, in a variety of ways, took effective action to co-operate fully with the scientists to ensure that the most complete assessment was made. They played a full part in the team effort, which enabled us to announce that food supplies from that area were perfectly safe and that there was no threat to the health of consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The Government's overriding responsibility is to ensure the safety of the food supply and to take whatever steps are necessary to that end. However, acting in the wider interest, we have been conscious of the plight of the farmers affected by the restrictions. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food visited the two farmers first involved in July 1991 to express his personal concern over what had arisen and to assure the farmers that our scientists and advisers would be working with them during the difficulties that would inevitably follow. Since then, our officials have had regular discussions with all three farmers and the Agricultural Development Advisory Service has provided detailed advice at no charge to the farmers on their farming options. The farmers have had to endure a difficult period and I am sure that we are all delighted that restrictions have been lifted. I have already placed on record the Government's appreciation of the farmers' help and co-operation during the incident but I should like to re-emphasise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the course of the incident there was considerable debate about compensation for the farmers. The Government made their attitude to compensation quite clear from the outset and I explained that carefully in the debate on the original order. Nevertheless, the question is of fundamental importance and one about which the hon. Member for Bolsover is anxious. I believe that it is worth repeating the Government's opinion today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, quite deliberately, no provision in the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 for compensation. That was considered in 1984 and 1985 when the Bill was debated. During the passage of the Food Safety Act 1990 the House again took a clear decision not to support any such provision. On Report, an amendment was agreed in another place providing for Government compensation where precautionary restrictions were introduced but where food was subsequently found not to have been unsuitable for human consumption. However, the House rejected a compensation provision even in those limited circumstances. The amendment was unacceptable not simply to the Government, but also to the Opposition. The House recognised that in acting to ensure the safety of the consumer it would be quite wrong for Ministers to be distracted by consideration of the financial implications that their decisions might have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's long-standing position on pollution incidents such as this is that it is the polluter who should pay. It would be wrong to expect the taxpayer to have to pick up the bill for compensation for pollution that the Government had no hand in causing. I am of course aware, as I am sure are other hon. Members, that the company operating the incinerator in the vicinity of the three farms has been negotiating with the farmers involved. The farmers or their advisers will, doubtless, have been able to make use of the analysis that ADAS has made of the financial consequences for their businesses. They
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
have also been able to use the information on the nature and extent of contamination established by the Department and other agencies which has all been placed in the public domain. However, this issue is now subject to legal action for compensation between the National Farmers Union, representing the farmers, and the company. I hope that the Committee will realise that it would be quite improper for me to comment further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to mention the presentation of the results of our investigations. The Minister announced at the outset of the incident that he intended to publish the results of all the Department's scientific work. That is standard practice in my Department. We stuck by that commitment and produced three separate reports last year. We have also done our best to answer the concerns of local people who were rightly and obviously worried about the possible implications of the incident. Indeed, I met the hon. Member for Bolsover and a large delegation of his constituents last July for that purpose. The hon. Gentleman has been a doughty and robust champion of the farmer's interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Included in the delegation were members and officers of the district and county councils, members of the Shuttleworth and District environment action group and, of course, the farmers. To place before them the most expert assessment of the situation that we could provide, I had with me our chief scientist of food, the senior scientific specialist who led our investigations in the field and a senior medical adviser from the Department of Health. It has not always been easy to answer all the questions put to us. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bolsover for mediating during that meeting. Inevitably, in the course of an investigation, not all the facts are known. But I believe that our policy of openness has gone a considerable way towards allaying local concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout this incident the Government have acted quickly and effectively to prevent any food safety risk. It is now clear that the contamination was localised. Only one farm was affected to the extent that it proved necessary to place statutory restrictions on the production of livestock or livestock products. I am delighted to say that the levels of contamination have declined more quickly than we once feared was likely and that the farm has now been brought back into production. The restrictions which precluded the Milk Marketing Board from accepting any milk produced on the two neighbouring farms have also now been lifted. The Department will continue to follow developments in the area and I shall not hesitate to take further action should it prove necessary to safeguard the public food supply. In conclusion, let me repeat again my satisfaction, which I am sure that the Committee shares, that this, unhappy incident has been resolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.49 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to say only a few words because, in calling for the debate, I was conscious of the keen interest that has been expressed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
by my hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner). All hon. Members will have noticed that he has exercised that interest on the Floor of the House over the past year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are to some extent circumscribed during this debate by the legal action, although had not that legal action been underway, I feel sure that the Committee would have felt able to debate at greater length the question of the relationship between Coalite and the difficulties that are being experienced by farmers. The issues on which I want to question the Minister will not all relate to that matter, but I shall allude to it. I recognise that he will not be able to answer all my questions during the debate because some of them will be detailed. I shall not criticise him, therefore, if he is unable to answer them all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke of the general surveillance programme which has been organised and which is referred to in the press release from his Department of 26 June:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Over the last year my Department has been carrying out a general surveillance programme for dioxins in food in a range of urban and rural areas."</p></blockquote>
On what basis does selection of those urban and rural areas take place? [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am referring to the general surveillance programme mentioned in the press release. I presume that there must be a policy of selecting various parts of the country, unless the Department's objective is to carry out a surveillance programme of the whole United Kingdom over coming years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to scare the general public, but the reason why I raised the matter is that there may be other, as yet unlocated parts of the United Kingdom where there are similar difficulties. Those parts may in future also require the introduction of an order to check dioxin levels in the milk supply, that being the best available means by which to establish excess dioxins in the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why was it felt necessary to introduce an order when I understand that, before its introduction, three farms of the original six—the sucker cow herd farm and the two beef-producing farms—had voluntarily agreed not to allow their products onto the open market? I suspect that there must have been some difficulty if the Department felt that it had to introduce an order under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985. Perhaps we could have an explanation from the Minister about that, revealing the nature of the considerations in the Department when policies are being worked out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us whether all the calves on the first two farms—the non-suckler cow herd farms—were slaughtered? Has the entire herd on either farm been slaughtered? Was there a general slaughter of animals on the suckler cow herd farm? What repeated monitoring is going on? Despite the debate that took place in the other place—where the Minister tells us that it was agreed not to pay
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
compensation—and based on our discussions, does not the Minister believe that there is a need for a wide-ranging debate on the question of compensation payable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to stray into the question of the legal action and I do not want to prejudge these matters, but if Coalite or any other company was found responsible, should not the state have some obligation to pay and then bring legal action against the offending company? The principle that the polluter pays is thereby retained and the victim of contamination is not put through the heartache and distress of having to bring legal action, either directly or through his association—in that instance the NFU. We are not talking about vast amounts of public money. Furthermore, the money would be returnable if the case were proven against the person or company responsible for the pollution. I put that on the agenda, as I have done on a former occasion, because I strongly believe that, in such cases, the Department should take a more hands-on approach to compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That case raises another issue. We have been talking about cattle, but could not wild species in the area, such as pheasant, rabbit and hare, carry dioxins, which might be transferred to the food supply? Vegetables grown in the area may carry dioxins because of the propensity of dioxins to remain in the land. I shall produce some information that suggests that the level of dioxins in the soil in that area has not dropped. Will the Minister comment on that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer to two reports. Unfortunately, one of them is undated so it is difficult to establish when it was produced. It is entitled, "Further Report of Studies on Dioxins in Derbyshire carried out by The Ministry Of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food." I am sure that civil servants are familiar with it. It refers to conclusions drawn from surveillance work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3. 1(ii) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"levels of dioxins in calves taken from Farm B appear to decrease on transfer to a dioxin-free diet. However, further work is necessary to confirm this".</p></blockquote>
What further work is being carried out? Paragraph 3.1(iii)refers to,
	<br><blockquote><p>"levels of dioxins in herbage samples from the affected farms were above the levels found in UK herbage in the survey undertaken by HMIP".</p></blockquote>
What were those other species? Will the Minister comment further on that? The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the herbage from the contaminated farms has lower levels of dioxins than the surface soils of fields".</p></blockquote>
What guarantee do we have that, in the longer term, the levels of dioxins in soil will drop?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 39v) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"as plants are known to take up little, if any, dioxins from the soils in which they are grown, at least part of the contamination found on the farms may be as a result of relatively recent aerial deposition."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
What does that mean? Does it mean that, perhaps even now, a further aerial deposition of dioxins is likely from whatever source it is finally established the dioxins are produced?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Third Report of Studies on Dioxins in Derbyshire carried out by The Ministry Of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food" was produced in about October 1992. Paragraph 2.2 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As a result of these findings, further samples of milk were taken in October 1992".</p></blockquote>
That was three months ago. it goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These results confirm that the milk from Farms A and C now contains dioxins at levels comparable to those found in other urban/industrial areas of the UK".</p></blockquote>
It then gives a range of dioxin levels and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The concentration of dioxins in milk from Farm B, however, continues to exceed the MTC"</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister explain how the concentration of dioxins exceeds the MTC and the implications of that? The reference to range on pages two and three, suggests that perhaps other parts of the United Kingdom have high levels of dioxin in soil and herbage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2.8, which deals with eggs, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"samples of eggs have been analysed in addition to milk and meat. As previously reported, eggs were obtained from Farm A in July 1991 and a nearby free range supplier in September 1991… A further sample of eggs was obtained from Farm A in October 1992… The October 1992 results are higher than those published by MAFF, but comparable with those found in eggs in the USA."</p></blockquote>s
I wonder whether a comparison is drawn with the United States of America simply because it has higher levels of dioxins in eggs. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3.1 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Inspection of the results reveals no obvious trend over time in the levels of dioxins in the soil."</p></blockquote>
That is further referred to in paragraph 4.2
	<br><blockquote><p>"Soils sampled in 1992 showed concentrations of dioxins similar to those obtained in 1991… This may be interpreted to indicate that dioxins are very firmly bound to soil and thus are largely biologically unavailable."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 6.1 also refers to dioxins in the soil. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Dioxins are very persistent in the environment and are known to bind strongly to soil. It would not therefore be expected that levels of dioxins in the soil would have changed significantly during the course of the Ministry's investigations. Uptake of dioxins by plants via the roots from soil is believed to be low, and the presence of dioxins in herbage therefore results largely from soil splash and aerial deposition onto the leaves of plants. The diet of the grazing cattle typically contains abourt 5 per cent. soil as well as herbage, and it might be expected that the concentration of dioxins present in milk and meat would reflect contributions from the dioxins present in both the soil and herbage. Although concentrations of dioxins in milk and meat have decreased, the dioxins concentration in soils have not changed significantly."</p></blockquote>
It seems from those statements, that the dioxin is
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
locked into the soil. How long will that last? I put that as a separate question from the other issues that I raised about soil which I would also like answered. Constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover are entitled to know the long-term consequences of dioxins in the soil. Even if it is true—as we must accept it is, given that officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are so convinced—that dioxin levels in food are below limits which would endanger the general public, I think that we need to know more about dioxin being locked into the soil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, on the question of herbage, paragraph 3.2 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The results of herbage samples collected from Farms A and C in July 1991 have already been reported. Further samples were taken from Farms A, B and C in the same fields as the August 1992 soil samples. The concentrations of dioxins found are shown in Figure 3."</p></blockquote>
Figure 3 is a graph at the end of the document.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The results obtained show a certain degree of scatter, but the concentrations of dioxins in all samples of herbage are lower than similar samples obtained in 1991."</p></blockquote>
Does
	<br><blockquote><p>"a certain degree of scatter"</p></blockquote>
imply that we are dealing with average figures and that there are areas of concentrated, dioxin within the greater area from which the herbage was collected? Can we have an answer to that? I may have misinterpreted the phrase but I suspect that it means that we are dealing with average figures across a wider area, within which, there are pockets of higher concentration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally on the question of the company, I do not want to comment too much but I think that I am entitled to read into the record part of a published document by Her Majesty's inspectorate of pollution. The document from the Department of the Environment is called "Investigations into the Emissions of Dioxins and Furans from the Smokeless Fuel Plant and Chemical Wastes Incinerator at the Coalite Works, near Bolsover, Derbyshire". Its Department of the Environment report number is DoE/HMIP/RR/91/066. The first page refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Abstract: Sampling and analysis for dioxins and furans … has been carried out on a chemical waste incinerator and smokeless fuel plant at Bolsover, Derbyshire. Monitoring has included gaseous and particulate emissions from stacks and aqueous samples from a quench gas and caustic scrubber system. Monitoring was carried out using a sample train developed at Harwell Laboratory based on the EPA Modified Method 5 followed by analysis using gas chromatography and high resolution mass spectrometry."</p></blockquote>
In paragraph 7.4, which deals with the summary of results from the modelling exercise, it is stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Two farms in the vicinity of the stacks have been found to have high levels of PCDDs and PCDFs in milk produced there (MAFF Food Safety Directorate. News Release FSD 43/91–26 June 1991). Both these farms are situated in those sectors which predict the highest concentrations and rates of deposition and are within 1.5 to 2.0 km of the incinerator and waste heat boiler stacks. However, it should be emphasised that routes of transfer in the environmental
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
pathway of the PCDDs and PCDFs into the milk are not yet clearly understood."</p></blockquote>
I draw that to the Committee's attention because it enables me to consider more than the one plan. In so far as the matter will be dealt with in the courts, it is for them to decide whether there is a linkage between the plants and the farms, despite what is in the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to my original question, do we have an assurance that, wherever there are incinerator plants in the United Kingdom and there is public concern, whether established or not, about the possibility of dioxin pollution of the local environment, those areas are targeted by the Ministry with a view to establishing whether there is dioxin pollution of the surrounding land? Are all such plants in the United Kingdom covered? Is there a rolling programme to deal with plants that produce dioxin?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wherever there is a chimney stack in the United Kingdom that releases chemicals into the environment, from whatever process, do we have an assurance that it will be targeted by the Ministry under the general surveillance work which it has, quite rightly, carried out since the decision, which was made in 1988 and announced in 1989, to establish the roots, sources and effects of dioxin in the environment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have raised many questions, but I recognise that the Minister cannot answer them all today. I also recognise, however, that people outside this Room, especially those in environmental lobby groups such as Friends of the Earth, will follow our proceedings and take great interest in whatever response the Minister gives. When he replies to my questions, perhaps he could place a copy of his letter in the Library so that it is made more generally available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark and Bermondsey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because I know that the hon. Member for Bolsover will want to speak at length and I do not want to go over the same ground as the hon. Member for Workington.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two matters that I want to raise in part relate to the matters that the hon. Member for Workington has just dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about constant surveillance by his Ministry to ensure that the levels do not become dangerous again. How do the Government conduct that surveillance, given that the responsibility is shared and not just held by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The responsibility is at least partly under the control of Her Majesty's inspectorate of pollution. In the Bolsover case or in any other case where that problem has arisen, what is the day-to-day practical way in which her Majesty's inspectorate of pollution, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, any other agency and Government Departments make
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
their reports? How often are those reports combined? How often are they assessed? What is the nature of the publication? What assurance is there for farmers or residents that that cause of concern will not recur there or anywhere else?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is being monitored? There are consequences not just for the important livelihood of farmers and their families in the constituency of the hon. Member for Bolsover but for local confidence in agriculture, in that people worry that they will be afflicted by what they assume to be the cause of the problem. There are also general health implications for that area and potentially other areas. There are implications for the marketing and movement of lifestock and for crops. Several knock-on effects arise from incidents involving dioxin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next question follows from the point made by the hon. Member for Workington. I accept the polluter-pays principle and understand why the Government did not step in and the polluter was left to pick up the bill. The practical problem is that it is not always easy to discover who is the polluter. Discovering whether a case can be won against the polluter is even more difficult. The NFU has taken Coalite to court. On the assumption that the NFU succeeds—I am aware of the dangers of jumping to conclusions—if negligence is proved and the cause of action is established, damages will be awarded or there will be a settlement, but that may be up to eight years later. That may be fine in this case because the NFU—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the hon. Gentleman to reduce the exposure to hypothetical consequences of the judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand, Sir Giles, so I shall generalise. Regardless of whether a court case is paid for by someone other than the victim, the remedy may be inadequate. The question for the Government—it is probably as much a question for the Department of the Environment as for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—is whether there should be a contingency fund so that people do not have to suffer financially for something that is clearly not their fault until the polluter is established and liability is decided. Assumption may be made about the wealth of farmers, but it is arguable that they will have spare money to put into the kitty to cover any loss. Access to capital is not as easy for individuals as for a public agency or the Government. I am asking the Minister for an initial response to remove the anxiety that arises when people are unable to carry on their business because, even if they are paid for research, the consequences may be crippling and may not be recoverable when the issue is eventually sorted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are my two key points, but the hon. Member for Workington asked many questions with interesting implications. I hope that we shall receive answers to those questions, either now or later, because they refer to the wider issues of food, dioxins and pollution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>

	<p>11.18 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinner</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) and by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington about the principle that the polluter pays. I have raised the matter several times on the Floor of the House. I am sure that in cases such as the one before us we need a system like the one in Holland, where the Government foot the bill and then ensure that the matter is taken up in the courts or elsewhere with a settlement from the companies concerned. The sooner we adopt that policy the better. It occurs in Britain to some extent. Under the public health legislation if a landlord will not repair someone's house, the local authority has the power to step in, repair the dwelling and charge the cost to the landlord. The principle is the same, but one case involves local government and the other would involve central Government. I shudder to think what might have happened if the three farmers had not been members of the National Farmers Union, which has the ability, money and legal expertise to take on Coalite or any other company. The farmers could have been without any resources at all. Under the current system of legal aid operated by the Government they would not have had a cat in hell's chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My only complaint against the NFU is that it did not react quickly enough. The matter began in June 1991, but it was more than a year before the wheels started rolling. If the case had involved three miners, it would not have taken the National Union of Mineworkers that long. It would have stepped in straight away. There is a good argument for the Government introducing measures to help people at the bottom who have insufficient resources to fight against the big people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order relates to an area in my constituency, but it is important to remember, as my hon. Friend the Member for Workington implied, that the problem could be widespread, which I believe it is. The case before us just happens to be the one that was spotted and there are good historical reasons why it was spotted. However, it would be beyond the bounds of credulity not to accept that dioxins are probably pouring out all over the place in areas where high concentrations of chemicals are being produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand why a Government agency might inspect that area. My hon. Friend the Member for Workington referred to dioxin deposits being locked into the soil. He is absolutely right; they were locked in during 1968 when there was a massive fire at Bolsover Coalite, adjacent to those farms. At the time, Coalite was producing 245T—the stuff that was used in Vietnam—which resulted in dioxin deposits being scattered all over the surrounding area. Coalite, which was then under different ownership, took much of the debris and buried it in old open-cast sites and hoped that no one would notice. Obviously, they could not collect it all and some dioxin debris was deposited in and around the fields. My hon. Friend the Member for Workington said that some was locked in the soil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Of course it is locked into the soil; it has been there since 1968.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We did not make the connection until the Seveso incident in 1976, when many people were killed in Italy and Dr. May was sent to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You have indicated, Sir Giles, that I might be out of order. I must tell you that this matter could affect the constituents of all hon. Members and I want to put on record why the people at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food became involved. It was because of incidents, which affected the farmers and the livelihoods of people in my constituency. Unless people understand the historical precedents, they will not understand the connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1976, when the Bolsover Coalite doctor was sent to Seveso, we realised that Coalite was producing 245T, as they were in Seveso. We began to stick the pieces together. It was only then that we found out about the dioxin contaminated debris that was all around the Bolsover Coalite factory. Some of the debris had been dumped elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1986, there was a fire. Some Coalite workers told me that barrels of 245T had gone up in the fire and that that too was deposited in the area around the Coalite factory. I hope that the Minister knows why we have this massive problem, which has not gone away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested that some of the dioxin debris, which is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Workington said, locked in the soil, is turned over year by year, as changes in the air and the soil occur. It just gets moved around. Tests could be different within a space of a month or two as the soil is gradually shifted about by natural movements—for example, worms—and the dioxin debris moves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be put on record that 27 farms were tested in north Derbyshire. Two were found to have levels of dioxins in the milk that were above the safety levels. But remember that less than 12 months before those safety tests in June 1991, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, with other bodies, changed the method of testing by a factor of 10. If the Ministry had used the old method, all those 27 farms would have been found to have dioxin contaminated milk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall press the Minister on that alleged change in the method of testing when my hon. Friend has finished his speech. That may give the Minister time to consult his officials about whether that allegation is accurate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinner</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We know that it is true; I have said it on the Floor of the House a couple of times and it has never been challenged. It has been represented to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on several occasions and it never challenged the allegation. It came up with a fancy argument, but the truth is that the techniques for measuring safety levels was changed by a factor of 10. Under the old system,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
every one of those 27 farms would have been included and not just those two and the third that was discovered in October 1991.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dioxin level probably became worse at the time of the testing because Coalite was taken over by another firm. The new company allowed the safety techniques to be eroded because it did not pay as much attention to safety. That resulted in the incinerator not working. That caused more atmospheric dioxin pollution which was deposited on the land that already had dioxins locked in the soil. That is one of the reasons why the farmers were stopped from pursuing their livelihood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that proper action was taken. The first thing that the Ministry did was to send the dioxin contaminated milk to the west midlands. The incinerator there could not get rid of the dioxin contaminated milk because it could not reach the necessary temperature of 1,200 deg. The dioxin contaminated milk was poured all over the west midlands because it could not be destroyed. It was only after I drew that to the attention of various people that the process was shifted to Ellesmere Port or somewhere in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been other mysterious occurrences. A fellow called Mitchell in my constituency wrote to the Minister not long after June 1991 to ask: "Mr. Gummer, what can I do about my horse? I have it grazed in a field near the plant. Is it safe?" To quote Mitchell, "Gummer never replied". He did not reply because he did not know the answer. He did not want to tell Mitchell not to graze his horse so I had to write to the Minister, and the Minister had to answer. The net result was that Mitchell was stopped from grazing his horse. Instructions were given for washing vegetables. Can anyone imagine everybody in Bolsover—the population is 12,000 and if the other three or four villages in my constituency are added, I have about 15,000 constituents—washing their vegetables at the same time, putting the dioxin down the same drains and into the sewers? That is what was recommended by the same Ministry that says that it did everything perfectly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mitchell wrote to me again because he wrote to the Minister again a few weeks ago and was sent an acknowledgement but had no reply. I have had to take the matter up again. That fellow wants to know what his position is; it is the same for all the people out there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We managed to get a meeting with the Minister. How did we get that? I had to get thrown out of the House of Commons before he would meet us. I had been trying to get a meeting for 12 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not take issue with the hon. Gentleman, who I know was anxious about the issue. He asked whether he could bring a delegation to meet me, and I hope that he will remember and acknowledge that I immediately agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinner</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was the new brush. That is not really how to describe him, but he had just got the job and thought, from a PR point of view, that a meeting might be the smart thing to do. However, it is true that that happened to coincide with me being unfairly thrown out the House. After that, the Minister agreed to a meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that meeting, one of the Ministry's officials told the 20 people from Bolsover who were around the table that he believed Coalite was to blame. The next hour of the meeting was spent trying to cover up for that statement. All my friends from Bolsover heard the comment—the farmers were there too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth noting that the Minister wanted a meeting with about five people. He complained when he discovered that there would be 10 and complained even more when he heard that there would be 20. The figure grew by the hour and we finished up with two busloads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being extremely disingenous. My concern was purely that there should be a room large enough to hold his constituents. At one stage, I thought that we were to have the entire constituency in conference room A. It was a pleasure to meet the hon. Gentleman's constituents, but initially he said that he would like to bring one or two of his constituents. The next I heard there were four busloads coming. The problem was an administrative complication, certainly not a desire not to see them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinner</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is roughly true. Greenpeace was present too. It is important to remember that the meeting gave the farmers and others from Bolsover—such as the councillors and the environmental action group from Shuttleworth—an opportunity to ask questions, some of which my hon. Friend the Member for Workington has posed today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents are still worried. They have just read a report from North Derbyshire health authority which states that leukaemia in their area is 5 per cent. higher than in other parts of north Derbyshire. People who live in the vicinity of the factory are bound to be worried about that. Results were also published showing that the incidence of breast cancer was several percentage points higher in that area than elsewhere. That meeting established that the Ministry would publish the results. It should be put on record that, for 12 months, the Ministry did not publish those results. Only after pressure from that meeting did the Ministry decide that, from then on, all the results would be published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I please correct that point? The hon. Gentleman must be aware, whatever he says—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinner</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is what happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, whatever he may say, the undertaking had already been given that, in time, we would publish all results and place them in the public

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
domain. I emphasise that point to the hon. Gentleman, who is being uncharitable and less than generous. I said in my speech that it takes a long time to collect and analyse all the information necessary to give an accurate, overall picture on which substantiated scientific evidence can be taken and on which we are able to act. That is the sole reason for the length of time that it took us. As soon as all the information was received, it was produced and put in the Library. What I said to the hon. Gentleman's constituents—in public and in front of their Member for Parliament—was intended to reassure them that the information would be made available and that I would personally send it to the hon. Gnetleman. I did that before it was put in the Library. The hon. Gentleman was able to distribute that information to his constituents. It is untrue that we were not going to publish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinner</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only state that that meeting took place in July 1992; the incidents on the first two farms occurred in June 1991. I have raised the matter more than a dozen times on the Floor of the House in the intervening period. I have called for a public inquiry, for compensation and for the results of the tests to be made public. It was not until we had the meeting in July 1992 that the Minister agreed that, from that time on, all such results would be made public. It could be that the Minister is being ultra-defensive about his gaffer, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who may have asked him to respond in that way. His gaffer never delivered the results. It was only at that meeting that the declaration was agreed between us and the Parliamentary Secretary. Why does he not take the credit for that? Why does he keep defending the little fellow?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister, who deserves great credit for his handling of this matter, always made it plain that all this information would appear in the public domain. Does the hon. Gentleman understand that the herbage testing alone has to be done not just on summer fodder but on winter and spring fodder? It takes 18 months to get that information alone. Officials have just told me that futher work has only just been completed, the results of which will be placed in the Library. The matter cannot be settled overnight if the hon. Gentleman wants to be thoroughly satisfied that we have done our job properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinner</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall that the argument about the test results being made public arose from the question of eggs, which were referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington. We discovered—not through the Ministry—that statements were being made about eggs being dangerous in certain circumstances because of dioxins. That matter was raised at the meeting and it was declared that eggs were safe as long as one did not eat more than five a day. Some Ministry officials at that meeting believed that five eggs a day was a lot. The Minister would probably want 10. However, I do not think that five eggs a day is an abnormal amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinner</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister agrees. We were told that it may be dangerous if someone ate more than five eggs a day. I do not regard that figure as high. One has to consider that eggs may not be eaten only in the morning; they could be put into all sorts of food. There is a question mark about eggs and dioxin, in addition to the matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter has not been properly resolved. There should have been a public inquiry in which the local authorities and all concerned could have taken part, but that was refused by the Government. They have not implemented the polluter-must-pay principle. They simply allowed the farmers some money for helping with the testing technique, but that was not satisfactory and dried up after a while. Now the Minister has produced the revocation order at a time when Bolsover Coalite wants permission to build a new incinerator. It is worth recording that the tests that produced the so-called favourable results to justify revocation of the order were obtained when the incinerator was not being used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us get the picture straight. In June 1991 and before, workers at the plant suggested that an incinerator was not working properly. We were then shown the results of tests on dioxin in milk. Those tests were carried out after the company, under pressure from Her Majesty's inspectorate of pollution, was told to stop using the incinerator. When the incinerator was removed, scientific results showed that dioxin levels in milk had fallen. The revocation order has been introduced at the time when the company wants permission to build a new incinerator to pour out more atmospheric pollution. I think that the two are linked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: 
	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinner</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am convinced that they are linked. There is a close connection between Coalite and the Government and there always has been. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is the Falklands again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also worth noting, as I said earlier, that the National Farmers Union did not take court action against Coalite until recently. The revocation order has been moved and I think that there is a link. Now that the NFU is taking action, the Government have come along and said that everything is all right. That may help Coalite if it is found guilty by the court or admits guilt on the steps of the court. It would be useful to be able to say that the problem lasted only 18 months and that the Government agreed that it had been resolved because they rescinded the order. I shall vote agin it because I believe that there is something sinister between the Government and Coalite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another coincidence is that the National Rivers Authority is taking action against Coalite concerning the River Doe Lea, in which the level of dioxin is 1,000 times above the safety level. The NRA has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
proved that effluent discharge from Coalite is pouring dioxin into the river. Is it coincidental that the Government produce the results of tests—they were carried out when the incinerator was not working—to shout that milk is safe at the time when the NRA is taking action? I was informed the other day that Her Majesty's inspectorate of pollution is also taking action, although I do not have confirmation of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impression given by the Ministry is that everything is hunky dory and above board, but it knows who caused the problem. The company is facing court action from perhaps three sources—the National Farmers Union, Her Majesty's inspectorate of pollution and the National Rivers Authority—and the Government are telling everyone in Bolsover and at Coalite that the order will be revoked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a coincidence. There is a link between the Government and Coalite, which is why the Government want us to revoke the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Bolsover, I shall stick rigorously to the subject matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To deal first with the hon. Member for Workington—I mean "deal" in a caring way, like Dame Edna—the legal action that is underway makes it impossible for me to comment on many of the issues that he raised. He knows that and was kind enough to admit it. However, I assure him that we shall write to him on the detailed issues that he raised about reports for which he does not know the date and which information we do not have with us today. We shall also ensure that other members of the Committee receive copies of the correspondence, as requested by the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to break down the information on payments to farmers. We have not imposed bureaucratic accounting procedures on farmers. That would be inappropriate in the circumstances. However, payments were made on the basis of a standard agreement for any contractor who carries out work for MAF on a research programme. I am happy to let the hon. Member for Workington have more details on another occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need to know the headings for expenditure so that we know exactly how much was spent on what. If there was a contractual agreement, I presume that the contractor will have submitted an invoice to the Department. Perhaps sight of that would be helpful. If the invoice shows only a fixed sum, the document inviting the contractor to carry out the work might also be published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's rather elevated sense of conspiracy is not of value in the circumstances. We will let him have such information on payments to farmers as we are able to give without breaching confidentiality. I have already given that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
The hon. Members for Workington and for Bolsover mentioned surveillance. The surveillance of the food chain, and other specialist surveillances for particular problems, covers many geographical areas throughout the country. As I tried to explain yesterday in the House when we were dealing with the patulin issue, the hon. Member for Workington will have to accept, whether he likes it or not, that we have the most sophisticated surveillance of the food chain of any country. Surveillance operates 365 days a year and seven days a week. It is an extremely sophisticated and important part of our protection programme for the consumer and for public health. Surveillance generally covers a broad geographical area. On issues such as those that we have debated today, it covers a representative area, of which we would be advised by our scientists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third issue raised by the hon. Member for Workington concerned the order. Testing indicated that samples of meat contained dioxins at levels that required action to prevent them from moving into the public supply. The order formalised the existing arrangements, which were entered into voluntarily by the farmer and which had already ensured that there was no risk to the public. Because milk collected from affected farms was bulked with clean supplies before entering dairies, there was no risk to consumers. However, the Milk Marketing Board decided that the milk should not go into the public supply and it took appropriate action. The order has been removed now that food from the farms is safe to consume. It would be quite wrong to rely on voluntary action alone as it is the Government's job to reassure the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I misunderstood the order. I thought that it related only to one farm—the one with the suckler herd—and not to the two beef farms. If that is correct, I am unsure whether what the hon. Gentleman said is consistent with what I said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have misunderstood the question asked by the hon. Member for Workington. I shall check and write to the hon. Gentleman on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Gentleman's point about the slaughter of animals: a sizeable herd has been maintained on the farm, subject to the order. Some calves are now ready for slaughter. The other farms also have sizeable herds, but no milk production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's fifth point was about repeated monitoring. He asked whether any other contamination comparable with that in Bolsover had been found in the United Kingdom. He also asked how we would repeat the scientific and surveillance processes. There is a theoretical possibility of a similar problem occurring elsewhere, but we have absolutely no evidence of it. If a problem did exist, our continuing monitoring programme would identify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am well aware of the hon. Gentleman's views on compensation. We debated that together on another
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
occasion and I have noted the point that he raised. He is aware of the Government's opinion, and it would be inappropriate to discuss it any further now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, he asked, in scientific detail, about soil samples. I shall write to him about that. Soil and herbage samples have been analysed recently and, once the results have been interpreted, they may clarify the situation. A further report on soil is expected soon from Her Majesty's inspectorate of pollution. I hope that I have answered some of the hon. Gentleman's questions. I am sorry if I misunderstood his question about the order, but I shall clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey spoke about surveillance and the food programme. I hope that he will accept from me—I said this yesterday on the Floor of the House—that our food surveillance programme is continuous. It is not carried out on an 
	<i>ad hoc</i> basis. It is a planned and ordered programme, which other countries would dearly love to have implemented. We permanently monitor every range of food. I suspect that the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey was referring to the more specialist sort of surveillance, which examines particular problems. We do that on an 
	<i>ad hoc</i> basis in conjunction with other agencies when recommendations are made to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made an important point about co-operating with Her Majesty's inspectorate of pollution. My Department and my officials co-operate with Her Majesty's inspectorate of pollution and all other interested Government bodies. We work closely with them on this and many other issues. Our scientists work with the Department of Health and Her Majesty's inspectorate of pollution as a matter of course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister and his Department work so closely with Her Majesty's inspectorate of pollution, perhaps he could reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover, who asked whether the Government will take legal action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the question asked by the hon. Member for Bolsover later, if the hon. Gentleman will allow me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey made a further important point about the polluter paying. I have heard him articulate his views on the Floor of the House and elsewhere. It is difficult, for reasons about which he is aware, for me to comment, but I am happy to discuss the matter further with the hon. Gentleman if he thinks that that would be helpful. If he wants to discuss the matter seriously, he should discuss it with the Department of the Environment. In the light of the pending litigation between the NFU and Coalite, however, it would be wrong to take the subject further today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reassure the hon. Gentleman that I shall send him copies of the correspondence that I am looking
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
forward to having with the hon. Member for Workington.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be offensive, but my memory does not coincide entirely with that of the hon. Member for Bolsover. I am sure that that is my fault, not his. I shall turn over now to his many points, which he made in his robust style. I am grateful to him for referring to me as a new brush, as I think that that is the politest thing he has ever called me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinner</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is better than a bladder of lard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, or a big girl's blouse, which was another description. I am grateful even to be acknowledged by as great a man as the hon. Gentleman. I want to deal with the serious points that he raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fairly briefly, please.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, but it is important that I deal with this properly as the hon. Gentleman's constituency has been affected by this matter. I note the hon. Gentleman's remarks about the polluter paying. The policy adopted by the Government of the Netherlands is entirely a matter, thankfully, for them. However, the Dutch authorities have advised us that they did not pay compensation but have provided some financial assistance to farmers who were affected by the case that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. I do not support the notion that in pollution cases the Government should recompense the victims and then take on the task of securing compensation from the polluter. That would be to enter into an open-ended commitment. The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that we could not do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to talk about the NFU. I share the hon. Gentleman's view—I think that we all agree—that the NFU should have proceeded in this matter earlier than it did. I have spoken to the hon. Gentleman informally about this matter, and I agree with him. I am surprised that it did not step in earlier, although I am delighted to say that it has done so. I hope that the farmers will be pleased about that development, but it is a matter between the NFU and them. I also note the great importance that the hon. Gentleman attaches to the farmers being members of the NFU. The NFU exists precisely for that reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He also expressed his concern about dioxin being found in other areas in levels comparable with those found in the Bolsover area. The Government conducts surveys throughout the country. Theoretically, comparable dioxin levels could exist-elsewhere. However, there is no evidence of a similar problem elsewhere in the country and if there were, the Ministry's continuing monitoring programme would identify it. If the hon. Gentleman wants to elaborate on that point, perhaps we could do so on another occasion.

I pass on to his question about the role of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in this affair. He made several unsustainable allegations with which I do not have time to deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinner</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister going to answer my question about changing the safety levels by a factor of 10?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will. The Ministry became involved because we were carrying out follow-up work after the release of a Government paper, "Dioxins in the Environment", which was published in 1989. The monitoring was a direct result of that paper and the results of the testing programme showed that the level of dioxins in food for the population as a whole were well below international safety limits. The Food Advisory Committee, which is the professional body from which we take our advice, endorsed our steps and, in particular, our view that it is unlikely that a health risk will be posed by the intake of dioxins in food in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman attached importance to the change to the tolerable daily intake levels, which he regards as a multinational cover-up. I want to make it clear that the previous figure was the best that could be used on existing knowledge. It was a guideline. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
tolerable daily intake that was later set—the change that the hon. Gentleman referred to—was based on new information and guidance from the World Health Organisation.
