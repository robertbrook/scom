	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>Banana Imports</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.38 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Ms Joyce Quin)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an unusual start to the meeting, which has given me more time to reflect on what I want to say to the Committee on a subject to which I think we all attach great importance. I spoke on a different subject in the Committee last week—the flax and hemp regime in the European Union—when we managed to achieve what I was told was a rare consensus. I hope that we can have consensus on today's subject, on which there has traditionally been wide agreement on both sides of the House, especially as we approach the negotiations to find a solution to this difficult issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The House has shown considerable interest in the future of the European Union banana regime. Indeed, it was debated in this Committee two years ago, when there was common cause in recognising the potentially serious implications for the Commonwealth Caribbean countries. Also, an Adjournment debate on the Caribbean banana industry took place in Westminster Hall last December, introduced by the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Wells). Some members of the Committee who were present during that debate spoke warmly in support of Caribbean banana producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said then, the Government are consious of the United Kingdom's historical and political commitments to our banana suppliers in the Caribbean. I assure the Committee that it remains our firm goal to achieve a solution to this long-running dispute that takes those commitments fully into account. As was highlighted in the December debate, it is a complex issue, for which it is hard to find simple solutions and the slow pace of reform reflects its sensitivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members may recollect, when the European Union reformed its regime in 1998 it was responding to an adverse ruling by the World Trade Organisation. The EU tried to deal with the elements of the regime judged incompatible with international trading rules, but unfortunately the revised regime was also found to fall foul of WTO rules. The United States responded by introducing retaliatory trade sanctions, some of which are still in place. They amount to $191 million a year, as approved by the WTO. It is a matter of great concern to the Government that such measures hit UK and other EU exporters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The WTO's arbitration panel has just ruled that Ecuador can introduce sanctions to the value of $201 million. That has yet to be approved by the WTO's dispute settlement body. We hope that Ecuador will not exercise its rights, but will concentrate, with others, on putting in place a new regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
In addition to the United States and Ecuador, there are many parties to the dispute, each with their own views on the way in which the EU banana regime should be changed. The only practical way forward, therefore, is to reach agreement with all the parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's objective is to achieve a revised EU banana regime that will not be challenged at the WTO and that reflects EU commitments to the most vulnerable suppliers in the Caribbean. We also want US sanctions to be removed. However, achieving agreement to a new regime is complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commonwealth Caribbean countries supply less than 8 per cent. of the EU banana market, almost all to the UK. They have benefited from guaranteed access to a restricted market, in which prices have been high. Successive WTO rulings do not say that we cannot give preferential treatment to our traditional Caribbean suppliers; it is the way in which we do so that has caused difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was said in the December debate, many Caribbean farmers find themselves in a vulnerable position. For reasons of climate and topography, bananas cost more to produce in the Caribbean then elsewhere. That is allied to a high dependency on bananas in the Windward Islands and in specific areas of Jamaica and Belize. The banana industry provides not only employment for a large proportion of the work force but valuable export earnings. A collapse in the industry would cause serious social and economic problems, particularly in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK is committed to helping Caribbean countries to restructure and reduce their dependency on bananas. Virtually all the aid available for banana industry restructuring and diversification comes from the EU, but the UK plays an active role in shaping and monitoring that assistance through its participation in the donor group. However, prospects for diversification are limited, certainly in the short term. The opportunities that exist depend to a certain extent on the banana industry's continuing viability. That is why we must ensure a continuing market for Caribbean bananas in the UK, and ensure that the industry restructures in such a way as to increase competitiveness and efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is enormous good will in this country towards the Caribbean, and we firmly believe that, with improved efficiency and effective marketing, its banana industry has a future. However, good will and astute marketing are not enough. Preferential trade arrangements for the Caribbean, and for other countries, play an important role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EU is seeking renewal of the African, Caribbean and Pacific waiver in the World Trade Organisation, which covers preferential treatment for ACP states compared with other third countries. It includes a new banana protocol that recognises the overwhelming importance to the ACP banana suppliers of their exports to the European Community market. The new protocol is a sign of the EU's continuing commitment in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Commission faces a difficult task in finding a way forward. Besides protecting our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0706">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
traditional ACP suppliers and satisfying WTO requirements, any solution must take account of EU banana farmers and budgetary concerns. Those four elements are difficult to reconcile. The Commission's current proposal offers some hope of ending the dispute, provided that it is adjusted to take account of vulnerable Caribbean suppliers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has reluctantly concluded that the only option that will be secure from further challenge in the long term is a tariff-only regime. Under such a regime, ACP countries would benefit from a tariff preference relative to imports from Latin America. The level of the tariff for imports from non-ACP third countries will be the subject of negotiations under article XXVIII of the general agreement on tariffs and trade. Clearly, the higher the tariff that can be negotiated, the less we will have to look to other measures to help the Caribbean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To allow ACP and EU producers to adapt to this future regime, the Commission's proposal includes a transition period, about which there was considerable discussion in the December debate, which it envisages will last until 1 January 2006. Until then quotas will continue to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic model of a transitional quota regime leading to a tariff-only regime commands support inside and outside the EU. Caribbean Governments have said that they can accept that approach, as have the United States and Latin American countries. Most EU member states can accept it too. It therefore offers the best hope of resolving the dispute, but differences remain on key details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the Caribbean countries, we in the UK would prefer a longer transition. The date of 2006 represents a compromise between the countries that want a tariff-only regime immediately and those that want quotas for a much longer period. We wanted a long transition and have been in contact with the Caribbean countries about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no point in agreeing a long transition if vulnerable suppliers go to the wall immediately afterwards. We should not lose sight of the importance of agreeing the terms for the final regime and of allowing the Caribbean to make detailed preparations. We must also pay heed to the important issue of licence allocation during transition. We have serious concerns about the licensing foreseen in the European Commission's proposal and we have made those concerns clear to the Commission and to other member states. Our concerns relate primarily to the management of quota C. Vulnerable Caribbean suppliers need to be confident of regular substantive access to our markets during the transition period and a striking price auction would deliver no such certainty. A system of historic licensing would be much better. The United Kingdom is not alone in that view. The Commission, other member states, Latin American countries and even the United States—in fact, virtually all parties to the dispute—now express a preference for historic licensing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following discussions with the United States and Latin American countries, the Caribbean countries
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
have made a proposal along the lines of the Commission's model, but wiht licences in quota C being allocated on the basis of a reference period—from 1995 to 1997—for ACP operators. That would give Caribbean operators fewer licenses than they currently enjoy, but sufficient to be confident of an operationally effective level of access during the transitional period. There is no reason why that should not be feasible. A reference period of that kind is gaining increasing acceptance among the parties to the dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I refer to the views of the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, referred to in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford. However, that committee's opinion is not, at this stage, the European Parliament's opinion. The European Parliament will consider the issue, including the recommendations of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in a plenary session next week. The committee's report includes some welcome elements, such as deleting the proposed auction system for ACP bananas in quota C, to which I referred earlier. However, it would also remove the transitional nature of tariff quotas and create a permanent quota system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is in finding a way forward on which all parties agree—a point made strongly by the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford in December. I would prefer not to be locked into supporting the opinion of a European Parliament committee that has not yet been discussed at a plenary and does not run along the same lines as the Caribbean countries' proposal, which has some support from the United States and other parties to the dispute. Therefore, although I support the view that lies behind the amendment, I feel that it would not be helpful at this stage of the negotiations. As I explained, the view of the Committee referred to in the amendment is not the opinion of the European Parliament, which will debate the issue next week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure hon. Members that we are in close touch with the Caribbean countries. Understandably, they are anxious about the way forward and have had discussions with the United States and others. Clearly, discussions between the European Commission and the United States are at a delicate stage, but they are at least talking about and giving some support to the Caribbean countries' suggestions. For that reason, we want to be seen to facilitate the process of negotiation rather than to close it off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we know, the main sticking point in negotiations has been finding an acceptable reference period for historic licensing in quotas A and B. The Caribbean proposal is for a pre-1993 reference period—in other words, a period before the European Union regime existed—which is naturally supported by the United States and most Latin American suppliers. Even Ecuador, whose exports to the European Union have increased in recent years and which would therefore prefer a late reference period, has said that it could accept the Caribbean model if some changes were made to the licensing arrangements—for instance, if a slice of quotas A and B were allocated on a post-1993 basis. However, the task of finding a compromise remains difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0707">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
An exclusively pre-1993 reference period poses problems for the Commission, which fears that it would be challenged in the European Court of Justice by traders who started operations after 1993. Recent Commission negotiations with the United States and others have therefore focused on ways of changing the Caribbean proposal along the lines of Ecuador's suggestions to a hybrid pre-1993 and post-1993 reference period, which might be acceptable. There are signs of progress. On 20 March, the Agriculture Council encouraged the Commission to continue its discussions with third countries in an effort to reach agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, we must not forget that US sanctions totalling $191 million continue against EU companies until the dispute is resolved. Ecuador has also effectively just been granted the right to launch trade retaliation totalling $201 million. Therefore, there is a pressing need to find a solution, not only for British companies but for the banana trade and Caribben farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The makings of a deal are on the table. We await the outcome of the Commission's further negotiations with third countries and the deliberations of the European Parliament, which is expected to deliver its opinion at its April plenary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During last December's Adjournment debate, the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford urged me to
	<br><blockquote><p>persist, pursue, harry and hassle to get an agreement.—[
	<i>Official Report, Westminster Hall,</i> 15 December 1999; Vol. 341, c. 75WH.]</p></blockquote>
I assure him and other hon. Members that that is precisely what we have been doing and will continue to do. We are determined to reach a solution that helps vulnerable Caribbean banana producers. That is the issue at stake. There are many other issues, some of which are technical, but because of that overwhelming interest, it is essential to press forward to a solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 11.39 at the latest for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and should be asked one at a time, as there is likely to be ample time for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke about supporting the historic licensing system and appeared quite bullish about the possibility of achieving that, yet the European document before us says on page 4:
	<br><blockquote><p>Since such an agreement appears unlikely at this stage the alternative solution would be an appropriate form of a first-come, first-served system.</p></blockquote>
Therefore, that is the fall-back position. Can the Minister put a little more meat on the bones of this particular problem? She appeared bullish, but the document seems to show no likelihood of agreement on this critical issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that respect the document has been slightly overtaken by subsequent discussions and the response of the United States and Latin American countries to the Caribbean countries' proposal for taking matters forward. Although the hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
is right that it is difficult to get consensus on this issue, the Commission has been torn in different directions even by different member states. There is now a stronger feeling that reference periods represent a better option than a first-come, first-served system. It is difficult to find the best reference period. That was why I described some of the possible compromises between pre-1993 and post-1993. On quota C and the reference period for Caribbean producers, there is growing support for the 1995–97 period as the best option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the state of the sanctions affecting the United Kingdom? What British businesses are hardest hit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of businesses are still hard hit, particularly in the carton and packaging sector, and they have made strong representations to their Members of Parliament and the Government. It is hard to explain to companies that they are hit by a dispute that appears to have nothing to do with them, but that is the problem with retaliation of this kind. Clearly, the sanctions have been approved by the WTO, which ties our hands considerably, but it puts pressure on us to find a solution as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned Ecuador. We do not know how it will approach the fact that it has been authorised to take such sanctions, which we hope can be avoided. Clearly, because of the level of trade, Ecuador is different from the United States, which had wide latitude in choosing targets for sanctions and could, as we know, target some high-profile industries. We want to reach a settlement that avoids the imposition of sanctions, particularly on unrelated sectors, which understandably consider that they are the innocent victims of something beyond their control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Janet Dean 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Burton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister mentioned that the EU was responsible for most of the diversification funding. What representations have been made to the United States and the Latin American countries for their support in this matter, as the problem seems to stem from there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good question. The developed countries that are party to the dispute could assist themselves. I do not know what discussions have taken place, although I shall perhaps receive some inspiration, but I know that these issues have been dealt with primarily by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for International Development, because assistance comes from the European development fund under the special framework for assistance. I accept that the group of countries that have responsibilities for the Caribbean countries should be broader than the UK and the EU. However, our historical links with the region and the fact that we encouraged the development of the banana industry in the Caribbean countries after the end of the second world war mean that we feel particular responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Jenny Tonge 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond Park)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To what extent have the Government discussed with the United States and other countries that are party to the dispute the possibility that instability may be caused in the

	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Caribbean? Farmers may diversify and start growing drugs, for example, rather than bananas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady rightly raised that concern when we discussed this matter in Westminster Hall in December. It has been raised bilaterally and within the EU. We must secure a lengthy transition period and effective aid programmes and have good ideas for diversification and restructuring. It would be perverse if the United States or another country took actions that had a negative effect. Obviously, no excuses can be offered by those who trade in drugs but, in the absence of proper planning, there are a few alternatives—we cannot always rely on people to desist from a lucrative but criminal trade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Diane Abbot 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister said that the sanctions that the United States is imposing on British companies would put pressure on the Government to resolve the dispute speedily. In view of the effect of sanctions on domestic producers, there are concerns in the region that the pressure to resolve the dispute speedily will have effects that are at the expense of the Caribbean producers. Is she aware of those concerns? She does not need me to remind her that the issue is important for the region because the greater part of the foreign exchange in the eastern Caribbean comes from bananas and because of the industry's effect on employment. Bananas are one of the few regional products that keep people in rural areas. If the banana industry collapsed in the eastern Caribbean and Jamaica, increasing numbers of unemployed people would flock to the towns and there would be an increased transference to a semi-criminal economy. Does the Minister agree that diversification is not realistic for unskilled male agricultural labourers in the region?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my opening statement, I spent more time discussing ways in which we could support Caribbean producers than I spent analysing the effect of sanctions on UK firms. When my hon. Friend arrived in the Committee Room, I happened to be discussing sanctions on UK firms, but most of my comments related to our concerns about the Caribbean and our determination that the foremost consideration must involve their situation. My hon. Friend should not misjudge the thrust of my remarks, which were geared towards supporting the Caribbean. The Government's approach was reinforced by recent debates in the House, our debate two years ago in this European Standing Committee, the debate in December and the position that has been taken by United Kingdom and other Members of the European Parliament. The lobby for a fair solution for the Caribbean has been growing in strength, rather than diminishing, and the Government will take that fact fully into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be possible for the Government to solve the problem of the effect of sanctions on individual companies by accepting the costs collectively, rather than leaving it to individual companies chosen by the Americans to take the blame?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult, once sanctions have been approved by the WTO, for Governments—individually or collectively—to offset the costs of those sanctions.
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
We provided some compensation before the WTO ruled on the admissibility and the level of United States' sanctions, but once that ruling had been made WTO members had to accept it. That is the position as I understand it; if I am wrong about that, I will let the hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the problems associated with finding other employment opportunities and suitable crops. What progress has been made on diversification and the identification of suitable new crops?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: that is an important point. Some progress has been made in increasing the efficiency of the banana industry in the countries concerned and in developing alternatives. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) said, it is not easy, particularly as we want to avoid the problem—that she mentioned of people who have been made unemployed by the process drifting into the towns and failing to find employment there too. That would exacerbate not only the economic problems, but the strains on the social fabric of the countries concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a good deal of interest in the question in some areas. Demand for organic produce is increasing. That fact was brought out in the report by the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development—I managed to glance at it before coming to this Committee. There is some demand for organically produced exotic fruits and vegetables, such as coconuts, mangoes, passion fruit, avocados, ginger, vanilla and nutmeg. As in all countries, the farm-to-table approach and integrating agriculture with the tourism sector could be developed. Obviously, there is a high level of demand from the tourist industry for fresh produce. Much of that produce, I understand, is imported, so import substitution may be a possibility. Such possibilities, however, do not represent a quick or instant answer and it will take a great deal of work and support if they are to have an effect. None the less, we are keen to engage in that process with the countries concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford. Although it has not yet been proposed I presume that I can ask a question related to it. The Minister was not inclined to support it. Her argument ran along the lines that, although the transitional period was extended in the amendment from six to 10 years, she did not support the move at any stage to a tariff-only system. Could she clarify her comments in that regard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless I misheard the hon. Gentleman, he has misinterpreted what I said. My reservations about the amendment were that the Caribbean countries have made a proposal to move to a tariff-only system after a transitional period, which commands some support from the United States and Latin American producers. Discussions on that are still taking place among the Caribbean countries, the United States and other parties to the dispute. I have reservations about an amendment that locks us into a regime that is not identical to the Caribbean countries' current proposal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0709">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
and does not seem to offer an opportunity to resolve the dispute. At present, the dispute seems most likely to be resolved by some kind of transition leading to the tariff-only solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The length of the transitional period is a slightly different matter. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the European Commission's proposal is that it should last until 2006. Understandably, many members of the Committee would like to see a longer transitional period, but, as I explained, the Commission's proposal was a compromise between different views in the European Union, with some countries wanting a much shorter—or even no—transitional period and others wanting a longer one. We argued for a generous transitional period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not time that the World Trade Organisation recognised that fair trade is not just about how much a product is sold for and took into account differences in production capacity and the difficulties of the terrain as well as such matters as animal welfare, an issue facing farmers in this country? Sometimes the WTO does not take account of different ways of producing animals or goods. Should we not push it to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised a wide-ranging subject, which goes beyond the immediate issue to the principle of the WTO's approach to trade issues, particularly in agriculture. She will be aware that, despite the failure of Seattle, agriculture negotiations are beginning again through the framework of the previous Uruguay trade round, in which we must consider the future of agricultural trade and, in particular, of agricultural subsidies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must separate the various elements and distinguish between instances of pure protectionism, which exists in parts of the developed world, and indeed on our own doorstep, in agricultural issues, and what we consider to be worthwhile goals—goals relating to development, the enviornment and fair trading in the sense of not exploiting workers in different economic sectors. As my hon. Friend will understand, it is often difficult to reconcile those issues in specific negotiations. We want a system that removes many of the high-price, production support forms of protectionism and seeks instead to open up trade while recognising environmental, development and animal welfare considerations. The issues will be raised during agricultural negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development has said, developing countries will increasingly be able to use the framework of the World Trade Organisation effectively in this way because, increasingly, they have strength within the organisation. I hope that that strength will be used to raise reasonable environmental and development concerns while not providing cover for developed
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
countries' extreme forms of protection, which have existed for far too long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Abbott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On diversification, is the Minister aware that a problem for people in the region who want to diversify into niche agricultural products is that they often rely on banana boats for transport? If the banana routes collapse, those people will have no economic means of transporting new products to the west. Secondly, has she seen newspaper reports about Sainsburys entering into an arrangement to use Grenada as a source for organic banana production? Can she shed any light on the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend's first point. Clearly, even diversifying in the way that I was talking about is dependent on a continued level of banana production. She is right that, given the volume of goods that the banana boats can carry, there must be a combination of the banana industry and diversification if they are to be used economically. I differ slightly with her apparent equation of the organic market with a niche market. The expansion of the organic market has been such that it offers much potential not only in this instance but to many producers elsewhere in the world. The potential should not be underestimated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confess that I do not know much about what my hon. Friend said about Sainsburys. The initiative sounds interesting. It would certainly be a good idea for some of our major retailers, which are large players, to consider ways of helping ACP suppliers of bananas to build up aspects of their industry that seem to have a good future. The organic sector is an obvious example. I am not saying that organics or diversification is the answer at this stage. For all the reasons that hon. Members have advanced, I do not think that that is true. Those options must be pursued with the pursuit of continued access to the European Union for bananas from such countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>'and, in the light of the unanimous decision of the European Parliament's Agriculture Committee to reject the Commission's proposals for a tariff-only system for banana imports by 2006 and to demand the retention of tariff quotas for at least ten years in order to protect vulnerable producers in the European Union and in African, Caribbean and Pacific states, believes that the Government should support the European Parliament's position and seek such an agreement with the USA and other interested parties which will reflect the European Union's commitment to Caribbean and African countries, particularly the United Kingdom's traditional suppliers.</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford had hoped to be present to move the amendment, but is in another Committee. He will be with us as soon as he can. I am happy to move it in his absence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has already referred to the matter and, in questioning her, I sought to clarify her position. She seems to be saying that the Caribbean countries have now accepted the reality that they may have to accept a tariff-only system and that they are in discussions with the European Union and the United States on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the amendment, we do not demur from the suggestion that a tariff-only system will be accepted and introduced. The amendment would merely extend the transitional period from the proposed six years to 10 years. The only difference is one of time scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment refers to "at least ten years." The Minister's point about not wishing to box herself into a corner in negotiations is valid. However, given the pressure from the ACP countries in particular and the need for a reasonably long transition period, that wording would give them the breathing space that they so urgently need and would be sufficiently flexible for us not to be committed to just 10 years. The period would be "at least ten years" and could last beyond that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have moved the amendment as a result of the unanimous decision by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament, which met recently. A report of the committee's proceedings states:
	<br><blockquote><p>The Agriculture Committee has voted unaminously to reject the Commission's proposals for a tariff-only system for banana imports by 2006 and is demanding a retention of tariff quotas, for at least ten years, in order to protect vulnerable producers in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
EU and in African, Caribbean and Pacific states. The committee fears that the flat-rate system proposed by the Commission in order to bring the EU's banana regime into line with WTO rules would bankrupt producers in the Community's outlying regions and in ACP states. The market would be flooded and prices would crash, say MEPs.</p></blockquote>
The committee made another proposal on which I would like the Minister to comment. The report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>During the transition period, the committee is seeking a minimum tariff preference of EUR 300 per tonne for ACP countries, instead of the EUR 275 proposed by the Commission, to guarantee them proper conditions of access and competition.</p></blockquote>
That is a technical point, but it would be helpful for the Commmittee if the Minister referred to it and said whether she felt that the agriculture committee's proposal was sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take on board the Minister's argument that that was only the committee's view and that the proposal will go to a full plenary, where it might be overturned. If a committee is unanimous in a proposal, it is more than likely that its members will be able to carry their parties with them at the larger session and it is unlikely that the proposal will subsequently be overturned. It would be helpful if the Minister would say whether she thinks that the proposal will be carried at the larger session.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without rehearsing issues that have already been discussed several times—as recently as last December in Westminster Hall—it seems to me that we are still trying to square a circle, or rather we are going round in circles and not making much progress. I know that it is an extremely difficult issue, and the Minister alluded to all the problems involved in trying to reach some sort of agreement with all the parties to the equation, but we are heartened by her resolution to fight hard for the ACP producers. No doubt, when my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford arrives, he will be pleased to know that his words have been acknowledged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are one or two key areas that we should keep in the forefront of our minds in discussing this problem. We know that, in many Caribbean countries, the production of bananas is marginal, in that, without the present regime, it is unlikely that banana production would be viable because the geographical and environmental conditions act against production at real market prices. There was a view that protection for producers was possible only with a tariff and quota regime. That was certainly the prevailing view of Caribbean producers as recently as the debate just before Christmas, when it was thought that they would have to hold on to a tariff and quota regime in order to survive. It was said that if the regime were to cease, all Caribbean producers would be killed off quickly. It is interesting to learn from the Minister that there seems to have been a change of view among producers, who are considering moving towards a tariff-only system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a high dependency in many Caribbean islands on banana production. In the Windward Islands, half of all export earnings are derived from bananas, and a third of all people in employment are employed in banana production. Any change to the regime that affects producer countries will have a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0711">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
devastating effect on employment and on the whole of society in those countries, so it is vital that they are given sufficient time to adapt to any new regime. Of course, the longer they are given, the better chance producers will have to adapt to the new conditions. There is a need for capital investment, for the areas under production to be extended and for better infrastructure to keep down the cost of transport, which means investing in roads and shipping. Rainfall is unreliable in many Caribbean islands, so capital investment in irrigation schemes is required to ensure that the banana crop receives water at the right time. Those are simple measures, but in fairly poor countries capital for such things is not easily forthcoming. Investment is needed in the ports for storage and containers, which are important for the export of the crop and ensuring that it arrives at its eventual market in the right condition. A great deal of investment is needed and the longer the countries are given before the regime is changed, the more likely it is that that necessary investment will take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We spoke this morning about the need for diversification to broaden these countries' economic base. We understand that the European Union has a programme of investment for them, but we also understand from the countries involved that they have seen little of that money in the last two years. The Minister should comment upon the claim that although the money for diversification exists on paper, none of it has been received yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition support the WTO and its aims. However, we feel that in this particular case, the United States should be challenged a little more strongly over their proposals and the iniquitous imposition of $191 million worth of import taxes. I understand that 76 per cent. ofthe EU's imports come from outside the region, so it is clear the region does not have a huge share of the market. The more one studies this issue, the more one is puzzled as to why all this fuss is being made over a small production level from a small group of countries, who depend almost entirely on bananas for their economic survival. The Minister mentioned that only 8 per cent. of Caribbean production comes to the UK market. In relative terms, that is a small proportion of the total banana market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will press the amendment to a vote. We feel that it strengthens the position of the negotiators. The wording, "at least ten years" means that there is still some flexibility available to those involved in the discussions. Presumably, the Government's MEPs in the agriculture committee and in the full plenary will be voting for a similar amendment. It would be helpful to hear from the Minister whether her views concur with those of her party's MEPs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Hansard</i> of 15 December.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Government's reservations about the transition period. I emphasise that the amendment strengthens the Government's stance. It seeks merely to extend the tariff quota system for another four years to enable people in the Caribbean and other countries to adjust. It does not seem to go against the Government's thinking; I believe that it reinforces it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was introduced to the subject of bananas as a member of the Select Committee on International Development when it considered the renegotiation of the Lomé convention. The Caribbean banana exporters association told us then that the protocol was essential, because much work and prosperity depend on bananas, especially in the Caribbean. For instance, the banana trade makes up between 30 per cent. and 50 per cent. of the export earnings of the Windward Islands. It is crucial to its economy. It simply cannot compete with the so-called dollar banana unless it has preferential treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the question of what farmers may do if they can no longer grow bananas. Last week, in Westminster Hall, we debated the problems of Colombia, which is being torn apart by the drugs trade. The United States of America is fighting a war against the drugs trade and the growers of cocaine in Colombia, yet, by supporting the World Trade Organisation—and therefore discriminating against Caribbean bananas—the USA could, if it won that drugs war, easily shift the problem from Colombia to the Caribbean, which is even nearer to the USA. I hope that the Government are telling the USA to think in a joined-up fashion. It is no good the USA fighting the drugs war on one front, in Colombia, if another department's policies transfer the war to the Caribbean. I should be interested to hear the Minister's response to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to comment on the general future of bananas. An article in a scientific journal about the dollar banana was pointed out to me recently. It stated that those big, horrible, tasteless yellow things are grown using masses of chemicals, pesticides and herbicides. It is a monoculture; the great danger is that the pests will become resistant to the pesticides and that the soil will be denatured by the fertilisers, which will result in no one being able to grow the dollar banana. Growers will have to resort to even more exotic methods, including genetic modification. The world would be furious if we had let the small banana growers in the Caribbean and elsewhere go to the wall, because the expertise for growing proper bananas—many are organically grown—would be lost as a result of the growers diversifying into other businesses. As I said to the Select Committee in December, the result would be, "Yes, we have no bananas." There would be no bananas, dollar or otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0712">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
The tariff quota system has been mentioned many times. I do not understand how small banana growers, who have smaller banana boats, can compete in the boat race between quotas A and B. The small growers will not be able to get their crops to the markets quickly enough to be licensed. Quota C licences will be auctioned; again, that will disadvantage the smaller growers, because companies such as Chiquita and Del Monte will be able to bid much higher prices for licences, so the arrangements will militate against small growers. The Committee has discussed the transition period, which is not long enough. I do not understand how companies can be expected to diversify in six years. The Government have also expressed concerns about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other proposals are welcome. It was interesting to hear about the historical reference periods. I have no means of commenting on which period would be best. Small banana producers will know what the best periods are for them. I hope that the Government will press the proposal because I understand that it is regarded as an acceptable alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us return to small, delicious and tasty bananas that come from the Caribbean and elsewhere. The fair trade labelling organisations and the wonderful European banana action network—Euroban is a lovely addition to the list of acronyms—point out that fair trade in bananas is growing. As the Minister said, the organic market is also growing all the time. The production of 17,000 tonnes in 1999 was a 20 per cent. increase on 1998. We hope that the Government will take seriously the need to persuade the Commission and to encourage African, Caribban and Pacific countries to move towards growing organic bananas in a sustainable manner. These activities are important—the market is growing, and we want such produce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise the remarks of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) about the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament. The Minister pointed out that the Parliament has not pronounced on the matter, but I think that we should support what that committee said. It, too, is worried that the transition period is not long enough. It is opposed to the boat race for the first two tariff quotas and to the auction system for distributing the remaining quotas. It has also called for special measures to be taken to encourage organic farming methods. The amendment provides useful ammunition for the Government in their negotiations with other countries on banana imports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My chief concern is that the proposals are a threat to the stability of the Caribbean, which is a part of the world that is dear to many people in Britain. I hope that the Government will rethink them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
I should like to make two points in support of my amendment. First, it is bizarre for the Government not to be seen to be working with the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, whose opinion they should take into account. The committee has rejected completely the Commission's proposals and has set out its reasons for doing so. I tabled the amendment partly to draw the Minister's attention to that fact. As the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge) argued, this is an opportune moment to put what I understand to be the Government's position more forcefully and with the backing of the European Parliament. We must seek a tariff system that ensures a transitional period that is not shorter than 10 years, as that committee suggests. If a shorter period applies, it should coincide with the Lomé negotiations, which are to be revised in 2008. Such a period will be needed to bring production costs down to a level that will enable competition with central America.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to persuade the Ministry and the Commission to move away from the idea that there is a WTO-compatible system, which will adequately protect east Caribbean banana producers. There is no such system and a tariff-only system would lead to the complete annihilation of bananas as a commercial crop in the east Caribbean islands. There is no way to make the system WTO-compatible. There has to be a special arrangement, protected by article 34, which gives developing countries a waiver from normal WTO rules and allows them to continue to grow bananas or any other crop or product. As the WTO proceeds by consensus, the only way to achieve that is for all the parties involved, including the United States, central America and Ecuador, to reach an agreement. Although a WTO decision has been made in Ecuador's favour and compensation is now payable to Ecuador under WTO rules, it has said that it does not wish to exact that payment if it can reach an agreement that is protected by the WTO article 34 waiver. The Commission, supported by the Government and, I hope, the Minister, should now proceed to reach an agreement that will protect the most vulnerable, and only the most vulnerable, banana producers in the Windward Islands—that is Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Dominica.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The banana producers of Jamaica, Belize and Surinam are probably capable, with a great deal of input and assistance from the European Commission among others, of bringing their production up to standard, so that they can compete on equal terms with central American bananas, given sufficient time to make changes. Those changes will involve building feeder roads and main roads, so that bananas can be put into containers in the field, taken to a modernised port and exported on ships that are full, so that they do not incur unncessary costs shipping the bananas across the Atlantic, all of which will require a much tighter management organisation than any of the islands currently exhibits. Therefore, a long transitional period is necessary—about 10 years—to bring production up to standard and introduce irrigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The banana plant responds vigorously to irrigation. Four times the production can be achieved if the plant is irrigated, compared with a rain-fed banana plant. Good
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0713">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
drains are also necessary to ensure that the bananas' roots do not rot or develop nematodes. Considerable reorganisation will be necessary if banana fields in Jamaica, Belize and Surinam are to become competitive. However, it will be impossible for producers in the east Caribbean, with its precipitous mountain slopes and smallholder farm production, to produce bananas at a price that can compete with central American bananas, so they must receive protection, unless the Commission and the United States intend to wipe out banana production in those islands. If that happens, the question will then arise of what alternative crops, including drugs, they will produce. I could take the Minister to St. Vincent, to the area around Soufrière, where she would be able to see drugs growing right now. She would also see the shipment of drugs from Colombia. As the hon. Member for Richmond Park said, if we do not protect those people, we will push them into criminal activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I urge the Minister to argue strongly for the case that she has set out, bolstered by the European Union and the view of the European Parliament. She should seek an urgent discussion with all the stakeholders involved to obtain an agreement that could be protected under article 34 of the World Trade Organisation rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great sympathy with much of what has been said this morning about the economic situation of Caribbean countries and the need for an appropriate outcome. I perfectly understand why the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford was not able to be with us earlier, although I regret it because my opening statement and hon. Members' questions and contributions dealt with many of the issues about which he is clearly concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one contentious matter was the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford. In addition to what I have already argued about the matter, the opinion of the agriculture committee of the European Parliament was completely against the Commission's proposals. It rejected the idea of an eventual system based on tariff only. That is not the Government's view. We do not completely reject the Commission's proposals, although we criticised aspects of them relating to, for example, the transitional period and the crazy proposals for the auctioning system for quota C. In European Union discussions, we have strongly defended the Caribbean producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Caribbean countries themselves have, as I explained, put forward a proposal that has received support from the United States and Latin American producers, envisaging a tariff-only regime at the end of a transitional arrangement. The European Parliament opinion was against such a regime and I am not comfortable with supporting an amendment that ties us into a fixed stance, when we are trying to work with all parties to the dispute to find a way forward. If the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford asked me whether I would be unhappy with a 10-year transitional period, I would answer no. All that I have said has shown that I am keen to obtain as generous an arrangement as possible for the Caribbean producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Given that the issue has been considered only by the agriculture committee of the European Parliament, not the full Parliament, and bearing in mind that that proposal is not entirely the same as the Caribbean countries' proposal, which we have supported as a way to put pressure on the Commission, the United States and the Latin American producers, while I understand the impulse behind the amendment, I prefer the wording of the motion, which reflects our current position and shows no weakening of the Government's stance. In many ways, our stance has grown stronger, partly because of the representations that have been made to us in this House and partly because our arguments in the European forum about the treatment of Caribbean countries and reference periods, which the hon. Member for Richmond Park welcomed, appear to be gaining support. Therefore, although I do not want to sound over-optimistic about a set of complex negotiations, we are moving in the right direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the right hon. Lady assure me that she believes that a tariff-only solution would permit the continued production of bananas in the eastern Caribbean? If she does not believe that—and I would be surprised if she does—then contemplating a tariff-only agreement for those countries would make continued banana production impossible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we get good measures in place on restructuring and get a good agreement on the transitional arrangement, on reference periods, on the details of what is proposed and on the rate of the tariff, then it will be possible to have a tariff-only system that meets both WTO rules and gives protection to the vulnerable Caribbean producers. That is what the Caribbean countries have proposed to the United States and the Latin American countries. We have been in close contact with them on this matter and I have no reason to doubt the wisdom of their proposal. However, much depends on the details. If those are unsatisfactory, it may be impossible for us to accept the proposal. As the hon. Gentleman knows, this is not a simple situation because we would prefer—and need—a solution that is acceptable to all and works within the WTO framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford to what he said in the debate on 15 December about finding special arrangements for the Caribbean. He sressed that we need to conduct proper negotiations with all parties and work for an agreeable solution. That is precisely what the Government are seeking to do. Hon. Members should support the Government on this matter. We are arguing the case strongly. We have to work with the fact that the Caribbean countries are prepared to move to a tariff-only system under the conditions contained in their proposal. I do not underestimate the difficulties in reaching an agreement, to which the hon. Gentleman has referred on a number of occasions. However, to say that an agreement is impossible is unjustified when the Caribbean countries are prepared to negotiate for a tariff-only system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the right hon. Lady to do the arithmetic on the cost of production in the east Caribbean and assess whether a tariff-only solution is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0714">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
possible. The east Caribbean countries say that they are being driven into this. The Prime Minister of St. Vincent told me a month ago that they cannot resist a tariff-only solution because of pressure from the United States, the WTO and the European Commission. He said that they know that they will have to accept a tariff-only solution in the long term, although that will mean the end of their banana production, but that they are prepared to do so to get a transitional period with a protective tariff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The points made in the Committee will be taken up by the Government in our contacts with the Caribbean countries. We are keen to remain in touch with them at all stages. Although the hon. Gentleman is pessimistic, it is worth striving for a solution to which all parties can agree. It will have to contain conditions that meet the concerns of Caribbean countries. Complex details on the negotiation for tariff rates, historic reference periods, licence allocations and so on might have to be included. As with so many political issues, the devil is in the detail. We must wrestle with that to determine a fair outcome for Caribbean producers. We are very much engaged in the process. Our work with them will continue so that we can determine what agreement can be reached as a result of their proposal to the United States and the Latin American countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the right hon. Lady's logic, but it is based on a false premise. She said that the agriculture committee ruled out a tariff-only regime, but nothing has emanated from it to support that assertion. Will she substantiate her contention that the committee has categorically come out against a tariff-only regime? My reading of the situation is that although it objects to the introduction of that regime in six years' time, it proposes that it should be introduced in 10 years' time. It has not ruled it out entirely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there is a point of disagreement. My understanding of the agriculture committee's report is that it is against any tariff-only solution. The amendment relates to a particular aspect of the report. The committee concluded that it wanted completely to rule out a tariff-only regime. The European Parliament proposed different amendments to the report. One amendment related to the length of the transition period, but other amendments ruled out the tariff-only system and rejected the Commission's proposals entirely. That is not our view. The agriculture committee was strongly against those aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agriculture committee, of which I was a member for 10 years understandably supports European Union producers. That is a large part of the thrust behind the Committee's decision to support Spanish and French producers. Although French producers are in fact overseas suppliers working out of Guadalupe and Martinique, they are treated as Community producers. Spanish producers are based in the Canaries. Those producers do not want the regime changed and, therefore, do not want a tariff-only system. As for the amendment, the Government do not accept the agriculture committee's view entirely. Neither have we totally condemned the Commission's proposals—that is the difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
The hon. Member for Richmond Park spoke warmly in support of the Caribbean and said how tasty its bananas are, compared to dollar bananas. That seems to be widely understood in the Committee. I am somewhat put out to realise that those small, tasty bananas have been more prevalent in the south than the north of England or Scotland, because of the pattern of trade that has developed. Perhaps, as a north-easterner, I have an interest in demanded from my local stores access to Caribbean bananas and in ensuring that consumers throughout the United Kingdom can obtain that excellent product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that regard it would be good if the Caribbean countries could make greater use of their quota in the European Union. It may seem odd to talk about diversification and trying to help increase quota in the same breath, but it is not entirely inconsistent, since we are discussing not merely diversification but restructuring and greater efficiency and competitiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire talked a lot about diversification and mentioned capital investment in various types of project, such as irrigation—which the hon. Member for Hertford and Storford also mentioned, although he spoke about the difficulties too—infrastructure, shipping and tourism. We are keen to work on diversification with the Caribbean countries. We are also keen to maximise the effectiveness of European Union assistance in that respect. Some criticisms were made in the debate on 15 December of the European Union aid-giving process. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development has been very active in that context, as hon. Members have recognised. We are working with other countries, including the United States, on development assistance programmes. We shall be able to intensify our efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome fair trade initiatives, to which the hon. Member for Richmond Park referred. The Department for International Development is actively involved with the trade in drawing up a paper on best practice guidelines for responsible business for smallholders in export horticulture. The aim is to help smallholders to adopt best practice and win market share. The hon. Lady and I also spoke about organic production, but there is no need to return to those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the difference in views in Committee about the amendment and the status of the European Parliament deliberations I believe that there is a consensus in the Committee on the determination to work for an effective outcome for Caribbean banana producers. I hope that, in my response to the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford in the debate on 15 December and today, I have made it clear that our determination is not wavering. Indeed, our hand is strengthened by putting pressure on the European Commission to change its proposals through the negotiations that are taking place between the Caribbean countries, the United States of America and Latin American countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that we mean to pursue this issue with determination. I referred earlier to the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford's exhortation of 15 December to pursue, hassle and harry in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0715">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
negotiations. We are certainly doing so, and I hope that the outcome will be satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In her response to my last intervention, the Minister explained her reluctance to accept the amendment. I gather that she is not specifically against it, but that she believes that it may give greater credence to the other amendments carried by the agriculture committee of the European Parliament, which may cause difficulties in our negotiations with the Caribbean producers, the World Trade Organisation and the European Union. The Minister said that other amendments, one of which would entirely oppose a move to a tariff-only system, could put a spoke in the wheels of negotiation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 13048/99, a draft Council Regulation amending Council Regulation (EEC) No. 404/93 on the common organisation of the market in bananas; and supports the Government's objective of achieving a revised EU banana regime which will not be challenged in the World Trade Organisation and which will reflect EU commitments to Caribbean and African countries, particularly the UK's traditional suppliers in the Caribbean.</p></blockquote></p>
