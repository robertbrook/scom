	<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG 
	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>

	<div class='debates'>

	<section>

	<div class='bill'>Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Wythenshawe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. The record of our last meeting seems to show that the Minister has it in mind to amend clause 2, in particular the definition of discrimination. That is an important point and it would be helpful for the Committee to know that I consulted, as did my hon, Friend the Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry), the organisations of disabled people about that definition. They were very anxious that the wording we selected should go into the Bill. I would like an assurance from the Minister that he too will consult those organisations, in particular the Royal Association of Disability and Rehabilitation, on the definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman knows that that is not a point of order; it is not for me to decide whom the Minister consults. We have passed clause 2—it does not seem like it but we have—and I am sure that the Minister has heard what the right hon. Gentleman said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 3</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>THE DISABILITY RIGHTS COMMISSION</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed [3 May],</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will consult RADAR on this clause and on every other clause. Bert Massie, the director of that organisation, and its members have been among those who, besides pushing the Government further than they have wanted to go on various occasions, have been associated with some of the improvements that have come under this Government and the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the previous sitting I was about to give way to the hon. Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry), and I mink that I should do so now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Berry 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingswood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What an unusual manner of giving way—although I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. When we last met, the hon. Gentleman said, at 
	<i>c.</i> 136 of the 
	<i>Official Report,</i> that we had been trying to "steamroller" the Bill through the House. The hon. Member should apologise for that. He should be aware that discussions on the Bill, and earlier versions of it, have taken place, over many years, with the respective Ministers with responsibility for disabled people. Those discussions have involved the all-party disablement group, of which I am secretary, and a range of organizations of and for disabled people. So it was unfair of the hon. Gentleman to suggest that those matters have not been on the table for discussion with the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and I am glad that I have remembered, over the past week, that he wanted me to give way to him—although he might have been more gracious and less offensive when I did. However, his point was not out of order, but was a fairly normal part of Committee procedure, especially on such an issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I was trying to make, and which I could have expressed better, was that the proponents of the legislation may act like a steamroller and think that they will be able just to push their way through; but experience over the past few years should have shown them that such an approach has not delivered the aims that they share with many people in Government. The approach that I recommended last week, and that I recommend now, is to discover whether the core of the Bill—the adoption of a relatively American way of legislating—will achieve more than the more British way, where the second Bottomley law of politics comes into effect: the law of detailed explanation. Instead of adopting that broad-brush, steamroller approach, if one asks Ministers and those outside Government to answer detailed questions, one gets those answers in the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, one writes and asks, "Can we please have such and such?"—and the letter gets lost. The second stage is to write again—and the Department writes back to say no. The third stage is to get two and a half pages that explain in detail why each point one is trying to achieve and the way in which one wants to achieve them will not be possible. At that stage, the Department and its advisors are listening to the arguments and considering points of view. They have not got to the point of saying yes, but within four and a half months the press and television will usually be summoned and the Minister will announce that the Government are going to do this, that and the other. The Minister's Bill illustrates that process. This year, the year before and the year before that, the promoters of the Bill should have realised that further improvements can be achieved by talking to and supporting the Government when changes are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a Minister with responsibility for disabled people and particularly for mobility issues in Northern Ireland—until Margaret Thatcher told me, "You're doing a marvellous job and, by the way, you're fired." The next day a newspaper report said, "Silly old Peter Bottomley went round Belfast in a wheelchair, and everyone laughed at him." It would have been more useful if the groups that were concerned, as I was as a Minister, to achieve better access, a better deal and better human rights for the disabled had responded to that article and said, "He might be a silly old fool as a Minister, but his work to overcome the problems of mobility was absolutely right, and we support him." The best way forward is to get the Government to accept or promote policies, regulations and funding that overcome obstacles. The steamroller approach has not done that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hon. Gentleman aware that, since the Committee on Restrictions Against Disabled People report was issued in 1982, meetings have taken place with the Government about precisely those issues? Is he not aware that I had at least two meetings with the previous Minister with responsibility for disabled people about the Bill last year, and that the all-party disablement group has had countless meetings in recent years? Is not the hon. Gentleman aware that the Government were opposed to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
any Bill at all 12 months ago? Given that Opposition Members have sought, and participated in, meeting after meeting and that the Government's response has, until recently, been, no, no, no, is it not unreasonable of the hon. Gentleman to accuse us of trying to steamroller anything through? History will show that that is an odd view of what has happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That was a very long intervention, and I have difficulty relating it to the clause, which deals with the Disability Rights Commission. I hope the hon. Member for Eltham will not rise to the bait, no matter how tempting it might be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly take your advice, Mr. Hogg. The hon. Gentleman and I are on the same side of the Committee. His remarks will not tempt me to cross to the other side. He asked whether I was aware of the history of the issues we are discussing. I am, and I read the minutes of the all-party group, of which I have been a member for some time. I am associated inside and outside Government not with the approach in the bill, but with what the Government have decided to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simplest approach to issues such as the Disability Rights Commission is to say that people should learn from experience. The hon. Gentleman's comments show that it has been possible to persuade the Government to make proposals they would not have made a year ago. The steamroller approach in the Bill is unlikely to be more successful than that of working with the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The promoters of the Bill should come to an agreement with the Government and establish what can be salvaged of the Bill in this Session. I hope to sit on the Committee that will consider the Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill, which has also been blocked and whose subject is another interest that many hon. Members share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Progress is being made, but not on the Bill. Progress ought to be made to overcome disabilities, raise expectations and help the Government to see what can be achieved. The history of the civil rights and disability movements will show that the approach of not engaging more with Government has not been the best way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Disability Rights Commission is the heart and soul of the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has outlined the differences between us, of opinion and of approach. His speech was not all that different from speeches that have been made before on this subject, during the passage of the Government Bill as well as, on occasion, this one. He raised extra items apart from his alternative to the Disability Rights Commission—the National Disability Council. We do not see the latter as the appropriate avenue. The more freestanding Disability Rights Commission is the avenue through which it would be appropriate to act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about advice and support services as well as ensuring that people .who had responsibilities were supplied with information. It seems to me that those second and third principles do not rub up against the setting up of the Disability Rights Commission. Not every aspect of the issue should be solidly in the hands of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
I do not see that support for the Disability Rights Commission is tantamount to a steamroller. If it is a steamroller, it is one that has been effectively stopped by the Minister's finger. There is still debate about the Disability Rights Commission, which will undoubtedly continue in another place in connection with the Government Bill. Although the detail of the make-up of the Disability Rights Commission—discussed under amendments to schedule 1—can be examined and debated, the notion that the principle of the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill can be dispensed with and that there must be some compromise is doubtful—as if there could be compromise as far as the Government are concerned, and as if they would not stand by their alternative position, the National Disability Council!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of the commission has been debated ad nauseam and is clearly seen by disabled organisations as the key item. If only we had been able to change the Government Bill so that it included the provision for a commission, rather than its National Disability Council, then although there would have been weaknesses in other parts of that Bill, a fundamental change would have taken place. I believe that in time, through the work of the commission, the principles of the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill would have been nudged forward and would have had to be enshrined in law, to elaborate on their detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore feel that we would desert the ship—or the steamroller—if we were to accept the Government's claim that the National Disability Council is an alternative to the Disability Rights Commission. It is not trusted by organisations of disabled people, who do not think that everything should be in the hands of the Secretary of State. That is not just a worry about this Government, although it is serious in that context: it is a general concern. A body that has the interests of disabled people at heart, which keeps its codes and reports at the fore and which makes regular attempts to get measures debated in Parliament should be the sort of body to shape the application of the Bill's rights. Without it, we shall not have a Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 96, in page 19, line 7, leave out from "people" to end of line 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 98, in page 19, line 14, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"2A. The Commission shall include—

	<ol>

	<li>a member appointed after the Secretary of State has consulted organisations appearing to him to be representative of employers,</li>

	<li>a member appointed after the Secretary of State has consulted organisations appearing to him to be representative of employees,</li>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<li>a member who appears to the Secretary of State to be knowledgeable about the provision of goods, facilities or services,</li>

	<li>a member who appears to the Secretary of State to be knowledgeable about premises and new constructions, and</li>

	<li>a member who appears to the Secretary of State to be knowledgeable about polling stations.".</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 107, in page 20, line 1, leave out from beginning to end of line 3.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I came to look at schedule 1, which sets out in some detail the constitutional arrangements for the Disability Rights Commission, I was struck by the prescriptive nature and the bias of the provisions. I know that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) has widely consulted organisations of disabled people and has taken on many of their suggestions. However, we need to consider not only the interests of those organisations—although they are very important—but the public interest. We need to find a sensible balance between affected parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule's first paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission shall consist of at least eight but not more than fifteen individuals … appointed by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
I have no difficulty with that. However, it would be better if there were more flexibility respecting full-time or part-time members. It does state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"four of whom, including the chairman, shall be full-time members."</p></blockquote>
I agree that a commission of such importance should have a full-time chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the chairman of BBC and the chairmen of many other bodies do not need to be full time, why should the commission be told that a person whom it wanted could not be considered simply because that person would not be full time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why I want the Committee to consider the amendment, because there should be more flexibility. If my amendment were accepted, it would still be open to the Secretary of State to appoint a full-time chairman. My hon. Friend is right. A person of considerable standing and experience might not be available on a full-time basis, but might be available for four days of the week. The prescription in the schedule will rule that out, which is wrong and precisely the reason why I tabled the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What happens if someone has family responsibilities, perhaps caring for a dependant child, or elderly relative or someone who needed care? Would that count as full time, or would it mean merely that the person did not have outside paid work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is matter for the promoter of the Bill, since I am proposing to remove the reference to full time and part time from the paragraph. My understanding is that if a person spends time as a carer and is not available for a full working week, that counts as part time on any ordinary commonsense definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have explained the purpose of amendments Nos. 96 and 107; amendment No. 98 is rather different. It seeks to meet my general anxiety that the interests of all who have a stake in the arrangements should be represented on the commission. Paragraph 2 provides that
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"at least three-quarters of the total number of the Commissioners shall be persons who … are disabled persons".</p></blockquote>
I shall deal with that in a later amendment. It is very important that disabled people be represented on the commission in some numbers, but there should also be a broad spread of interests, and those who will be affected by the Bill's provisions should be represented too. That is why amendment No. 98 would provide for a person to represent employers, who will be affected in a big way by the Bill, for a person to represent employees—I think that trade union representation would be good—and for people to represent other sectors on which the Bill impacts. Such people would probably include a representative of retailers or of service providers, someone from the construction industry, given the major impact that the Bill will have on that industry, and, possibly, someone who knows something about polling stations—perhaps a returning officer. The general point is that the commission should be more widely based. It is very narrowly based at present and it should contain people to represent all interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to follow the points made by my hon. Friend. The nearest and most direct equivalent to the commission is the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, which has a statutory basis. I cannot remember the legislation for that requiring this degree of precision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps amendment No. 98 is a probing amendment. If it were accepted, I hope that there would be no reason why one person could not fulfil more than one of the amendment's provisions. If a person who was proposed following consultation for the first two categories—new paragraph 2A(a) or (b)—met the provisions of subparagraphs (c), (d) or (e), that should not be considered to be clever, but as natural.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I helped to discuss who should be a member of the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, there was no great difficulty in covering the important sectors, and if someone claimed that a person of particular expertise was not included, it was quite easy, on reconstitution, to include him or her. The Committee was co-operative; it was not intended to do things against the wishes of those involved or of those who were knowledgeable. It took a positive approach and I think that members of this Committee agree that that should happen here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are difficulties with being prescriptive, but flexibility is included on page 20—the second page of schedule 1—and perhaps the promoters of the Bill will explain why some of the questions that I raised earlier have simple answers. If I am not present to hear all the answers, that is because I am also trying to serve on European Standing Committee B, which is discussing telecommunications in the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want my contribution to be considered as anything other than a serious attempt to explain that there ought to be ways of recognising needs, and that if there is to be a commission, it should be able to have sensible flexibility and to be sufficiently comprehensive to carry credibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 96 and 107 seem to be directly related to each other in that amendment No. 96 objects to there being four full-time members of the Disability Rights Commission and amendment No. 107
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
deletes schedule 1, paragraph 7(3), which overcomes the arrangements for moving between full-time and part-time commissioners and vice versa—those distinctions would be removed by amendment No. 96. What happens will depend on hon. Members' attitudes to amendment No. 96.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that involving a chair and three others full time in the work of the Disability Rights Commission is excessive. We are discussing the most massive workload imaginable. People right to me as the promoter of the Bill about their problems with disability and the complexities of their lives. Clearly, a massive task faces any organisation, be it council or commission, that deals with such matters. Four full-timers seems a minimum requirement to tackle the workload fully and professionally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman say whether he envisages that the four full-time members would have executive responsibilities? Normally, commissioners would have supervisory, non-executive duties, while the management would take on the executive responsibilities of an organisation such as that described in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the full-timers would be the chairman, who would be able to make temporary decisions that could be ratified later by the full body. I do not envisage the other three full-time members operating as a triumvirate or politburo. The expertise in the rest of the commission is very important. There is no reason why the work load faced by some people should not be greater than that faced by others. The research that they initiate and engage in could be offered for decision by the commission. Such executive decisions, apart from those touching on advice and conciliation, would not be made in isolation but would be considered by the whole commission. That would be more easily achieved if full-time professionals occupied those posts.

Amendment No. 98 is not without merit, in that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield has listed some of the key matters to do with the Bill, such as the point about polling stations. However, the list that the amendment contains is not exhaustive. Moreover, the matters contained in it could be expected to be borne in mind when appointments were being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no need for the list to be included on the face of the Bill. The Minister may feel differently, although he is in a peculiar position. He does not want the commission in the first place, so he may have no interest in amending the Bill to alter the composition of its members. However, if he were to accept the logic of having a commission for a moment, his response to the amendment might be of interest to the Committee.

I understand the good intention behind the amendments, but I cannot accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This and the related amendments are about picking holes in the concept of a Disability Rights Commission. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and the Minister have been unable to delete from the Bill the proposal for such a commission, so they have gone for what they regarded as the second best option—namely, changes to the schedule that helps to give the proposal effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same way, the Government say that they could try to amend their proposal for a National Disability Council. It cannot be made too clear that the organisations of and for disabled people are opposed to substituting for the Disability Rights Commission a National Disability Council. They say that a comparison between the two bodies is a comparison between chalk and cheese—it is an absurd exercise in futility. However one may try to change chalk into cheese, it is a futile exercise in terms of disabled people. They do not want anything other than the Disability Rights Commission, as they have shown on many occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The House of Lords has approved the proposal, and the Bill, on three occasions. I am certain that when the House of Lords considers the matter again it will stand by the Bill's proposal for a Disability Rights Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: None of the amendments is an attempt to substitute a National Disability Council for the Disability Rights Commission. They are all about the composition of the commission, and who should be its members. I repeat that at present the schedule is too prescriptive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes), but I was no clearer about who would have executive responsibility. It is not normal in a commission such as is proposed for the commissioners to have executive responsibility. Normally, there is a chief executive and a group of executives with management responsibility for the day-to-day running of such a body. They are supervised by commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that, because of the commission's importance, its chairman might need to be full time, although I do not agree that that need be prescribed in the Bill. However, I do not understand how there could be room for four full-time commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More significantly, it is important that the interests set out in amendment No. 98 should be represented on the commission and that that should be stated clearly in the Bill. The amendment does not mention transport, but my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) did. That service has an important impact on disabled people, and would be covered by new paragraph 2A(c). Therefore, I should like to press amendment No. 98.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the anxieties expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), but he seems to be substituting one prescription for another. He criticises schedule 1 for being too prescriptive, but his amendments would import his own preferred variety of prescription.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All hon. Members would agree that it would be extremely important that when appointments to the Disability Rights Commission were made, as far as possible, a range of interests helpful to the work of the commission were represented in its membership. The same problem arises continually: we want to ensure that there is adequate representation of all the affected interests, but achieving that would mean that the commission would end up being huge and cumbersome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why stop at representatives of employers and employees and the other categories enumerated by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield? Why not have ethnic minority or regional representatives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a good reason. Apart perhaps from employees, all the interests that I have listed are directly affected by the Bill. That is why they should be included in the commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill will impact on members of ethnic minorities and on people living in the regions. A case could also be made for their representation on the same principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I would prefer not to include their representation on the commission. Instead the Minister, or whoever makes the appointments, should bear in mind the need for a balanced membership that is, as far as possible, representative of those affected. Above all, it is vital to get people who are competent and motivated to do the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule as drafted is therefore sensible. I am not opposed to the provision for four full-time members, although the number four is arbitrary. However, it is crucial that there be no delays in the commission's operation. The commission will have an immensely important role and is indispensable, but its activities should not be impeded because sufficient commissioners are not available to approve the decisions and develop the strategy of the commission's executive members. I hope that eventually it will not have the size of work load that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East envisaged, but at least in the early years, the commission will be a busy organisation and it is therefore important that it is not held up for lack of available commissioners to do the work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 97, in page 19, line 9, leave out "three-quarters" and insert "a half".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple object of the amendment is to reduce the representation of disabled people on the commission from three quarters to a half. It is obviously extremely important that disabled people should be represented on the commission, but three quarters is an excessive proportion, especially if other interests are to be represented. If disabled people make up half the members, that will still give them a substantial influence over the decisions of the commission while allowing for other interests to be represented. If the commission has a
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
minimum of eight members and disabled people make up three quarters of it, there would be only two places for people representing all other interests. As I said earlier, it is vital that other interests that will be affected by the Bill are represented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that we should reduce the three quarters to a half; will he tell us any organisations of or for disabled people that support the view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not suppose that there are any, but I have already said that it is important that we take other organisations into account. It simply is not sensible to legislate on the basis of the views of only one group of people, however important those people are. In legislating, it is vital also to consider what is in the public interest; we must achieve a sensible balance between the interests and benefits of disabled people, whom we all want to help, and the cost that will be widely imposed by the Bill on employers, providers of services and the retailers of goods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman assume that employers and providers of goods and services may not themselves be disabled people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is possible and could well be the case. I hope that my concerns could be met by ensuring that disabled people who also represent those interests would be able to serve on the commission. That is an extremely good idea, if suitably qualified people can be found to do so. I remain concerned, however, that the other interests should be adequately represented. That way in which the schedule is drafted at the moment gives no guarantee that that would be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful—I do not think that this is an unfair request—if the hon. Gentleman related his argument to the experience of the Commission for Racial Equality and the Equal Opportunities Commission. Can he give an example of people who were perpetrating discrimination being included by statute in those commissions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware that sex discrimination legislation provides that three quarters of the members of the Equal Opportunities Commission should be women, or that race relations legislation provides that three quarters of the members of what was the Race Relations Board—now the Commission for Racial Equality—should have three quarters of its members drawn from ethnic minorities. That is the parallel. I do not think that either Act makes a similar provision. If they do so most people would consider it unreasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have news for the hon. Gentleman. The two other commissions do not regard the idea as unreasonable. The hon. Gentleman missed the point that I was trying to make. The point is not what happens with the 50 per cent. who would be disabled people, but the fact that his amendment would open the door to the possibility that half of the commission might consist of people who themselves had practised discrimination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Appointments are a matter for the Secretary of State, and he is unlikely to choose people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
who are known to have practised discrimination. That is not what I am proposing, and I think the hon. Gentleman knows that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has raised an important point about equal opportunities and race relations legislation. I have not examined the precedents in the relevant Acts, but I would be very surprised if either provided that three quarters of the members of the respective commissions should be representatives of the people for whose benefit the legislation is designed. Obviously some members of the Commission for Racial Equality are from the ethnic minorities, and I know that there are members of the Equal Opportunities Commission who are women, but I do not believe that the legislation that established those two bodies is as prescriptive as the schedule. I consider that amendment No. 97, which would reduce the proportion of disabled people from three quarters to a half, is a reasonable way of ensuring a sensible balance of interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 99 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At least one third of the members of the Commission shall be women."</p></blockquote>
It is a probing amendment, to find out what the attitude of the Bill's promoter is to women members of the commission, and whether he intends women to be represented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 97 needs to be viewed in the light of the Bill's definition of disability. We have argued that 6.5 million people are covered by the Bill. Therefore the fact that 75 per cent. of the commission is expected to come from that defined area, or to be associated with organisations that represent people in that area, does not seem at all unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a large number of people, which includes those with the talents needed to carry out the work of the commission. Individuals can wear more than one hat. Amendment No. 98, tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, has still to be voted on. It makes reference to being
	<br><blockquote><p>"knowledgeable about the provision of goods, facilities or services … knowledgeable about premises and new constructions, and … knowledgeable about polling stations."</p></blockquote>
We want a large contribution from disabled people who are knowledgeable about those matters. Being knowledgeable about a polling station with all its complexities is one area of important expertise. But having experienced a visit to a polling station and difficulty exercising the franchise is an even more important consideration. Those of us who are not disabled can only appreciate that in a second-hand way.

The hon. Member for Eltham told us that when he was a Northern Ireland Minister, he went about in a wheelchair to find out the real problems of disabled people. I have not done that. This weekend, however, I took my mother-in-law around London in her wheelchair during the VE day celebrations. I pushed her about the city and helped her in and out of her wheelchair, which was an educational experience for me in the realities of disabled people's problems. It is people from the sort of communities that my mother-in-law inhabits—people
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
with expertise in appropriate areas—whom we need to get involved in the work of the commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that, far from this part of the Bill steamrollering its way through Committee, its provisions are entirely consistent with majority opinion expressed in the famous red book produced from time to time by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood—that is, consistent with the views expressed to the Government in their consultation exercise? Would my hon. Friend also agree that not a single organisation of or for disabled people would support the hon. Gentleman's proposed changes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. When we voice the views of organisations of and for disabled people, we are accused of adopting a streamrolling approach. It is suggested that such organisations have come together after long discussions and developed a position. There may be minor differences, but it is assumed that a position has been solidly worked out. Anyone who adopts that position is then strongly criticised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right for disabled groups' views to be developed. We also apply our own minds to problems. Sometimes it is assumed that arguments are free standing—despite the weight of opinion behind them—to allow people to say no. We understand the Minister's point, but we must also recognise the importance of disabled people being fully involved in the work of the commission. The talent is there to do the job, and that is what the Bill is about. The talent in society needs to be unleashed and used for purchasing goods, for working and for many other purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Hendry 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(High Peak)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that there is no provision in the Sex Discrimination Act for a specific number of women on the Equal Opportunities Commission, nor is there any requirement for a certain proportion of people on the Commission for Racial Equality to have ethnic backgrounds. Why does the hon. Gentleman think that his commission should be treated differently from these others?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One clear argument is that legislative practices advance and develop over time. The view that the people most affected should be strongly represented is a good, solid argument, and it should be applied to the commissions that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. We are talking about developing legislation for disabled people and seeking approaches to achieve that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. His proposals are entirely logical. If the Equal Opportunities Commission proposed quotas of more than 50 per cent. for men or women, that would be blatant discrimination. We are dealing with discrimination against disabled people, and that is why there should be a clear majority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is also a difference between racial discrimination and discrimination on the ground of gender. We are all involved with disability because it can potentially affect the whole of society, although many able-bodied people do not understand that problem. I hope that education has advanced in such a way that people who are not considered to be in the categories that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
are being discriminated against will now understand the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another difference is that race relations legislation applies across the board. People from any ethnic group can be discriminated against. We must examine the needs of disabled people carefully. There is a case for the 75 per cent. figure, although I accept that the dividing line is never precise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, the hon. Gentleman seeks to recognise the relevant distinctions. We are, nevertheless, all potentially disabled people, and it is in all our interests for disabled people to form a majority of the commission. No one should believe that that would threaten the balance of the commission's work or the interests of the wider community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. I wanted to present similar arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much to be said for amendment No. 99, which has been presented as a probing amendment. If the commission seeks to end discrimination against disabled people, it should perhaps also take into account other forms of discrimination in society. If other commissions adopted similar principles about the percentages of people involved in them reflecting the size of groups against whom bias was greatest, the measure would fit in quite well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not like to be seen to reject such a reasonable demand. Disability knows no distinction between the sexes, and it is right that a great number of women should be represented. There might, therefore, be a case for building in a specific threshold. Otherwise, there might be a tendency not to take the number of women into account when the selection was made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak against the amendment. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield, who tabled the amendment, clearly accepts in principle that the schedule should lay down that a certain proportion of the commissioners should be disabled people or representatives of disabled people's organisations. He accepts the principle, so the debate is about a half versus three quarters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
References to the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 are not strictly relevant because the hon. Gentleman has conceded the principle that there should be a specific requirement for disabled people to be represented. Although we all want balance on the commission, I might say in passing that the Sex Discrimination Act is about discrimination on grounds of either gender and the Race Relations Act does not, as some people have suggested, operate on the assumption that only some people are members of ethnic groups, while others are not. We are all members of ethnic groups—but that is a slight digression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle that a certain proportion of commissioners should be disabled people is fully accepted by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, so the debate is between a half and three quarters. I am generous enough to be able to say that discussing such matters comes down to a matter of judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So why might I prefer the three quarters to the half that the amendment suggests? First and foremost, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield seemed to assume that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
disabled people on the commission would represent the interests of disabled people, and that those interests are fundamentally in conflict with the interests of employers and of the providers of goods and services. He seemed to suggest that employers or providers of goods and services could not possibly be disabled people. I find it extraordinary that he should work on that premise. If it is true, we must be far more radical than we currently plan to be. I would not assume that no disabled people are employers, or that disabled people do not provide goods and services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is always eminently fair. Could I ask him not to be persuaded to split the difference between a half and three quarters and not to specify five eighths? He should stand by the wording of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend, as always. First, I am in no position to make any concessions. Secondly, I am speaking against the amendment which would delete three quarters. I think that three quarters represents a perfectly moderate position to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield should not be concerned about the provisions of the Bill because he said that there should be a sensible balance of interest and that, ultimately, the Secretary of State will appoint the commissioners. I have faith in Secretaries of State—in the abstract. I have no specific Secretary of State in mind, and it would be out of order to digress on that matter. In principle, the notion of the Secretary of State appointing the commissioners seems reasonable, and that is what the Bill provides for. I cannot understand why there should be any concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we will not delay our proceedings for too long on the amendment. I find it inconceivable that any Secretary of State of whatever party would find the requirement of the schedule that three quarters of the commissioners should be disabled people or recognised representatives of disabled people's organisations a constraint. The relevant paragraph of the schedule intends to ensure that the commissioners cannot act in a manner that does not recognise the fundamental purpose of the legislation, which is to ensure the elimination of unfair discrimination against disabled people. That is why disabled people should be in the driving seat as commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add two brief points in support of the proposition that three quarters of the commission should be made up of disabled people or of representatives of disabled people's organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, disabled people, who have suffered greatly from discrimination, need to believe that the commission will be seriously and genuinely committed to the objective of removing discrimination. It would enormously enhance the commission's credibility if three quarters of its members were disabled people, or their representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, to reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and those who may fear that a commission so constituted might be biased, I submit that it would not be to the advantage of disabled people if they advanced their interests unreasonably. Disabled people know that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
they must not overplay their hand, and that the Disability Rights Commission must not be seen to be biased in their favour or to act unreasonably in its dealings or its judgments. Nothing would do more to set back the interests of disabled people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security and Disabled People (Mr. William Hague)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee knows that it has not been my approach to table amendments to schedule 1 or clause 3. The Government disagree fundamentally with that part of the Bill, which represents a major difference between this Bill and the Disability Discrimination Bill. As I have said previously, we would have to return to this part of the Bill at any future Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I have some sympathy with amendment No. 97, the only one to which I wish to speak. The amendment is in line with clause 1's 50 per cent. requirement for an organisation to be defined as "an organisation of disabled people". It is also in line with the proportion required of organisations for disabled people that belong to the British Council, and with the proportion required by the American National Council on Disability. No one could say that any of those organisations were in any way lacking as champions of people with disabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should take our cue from those organisations, from the clear precedents that have been set and from the merits of the argument that, in constituting any council—or the commission proposed in the Bill—we need to draw on the best people for the job, whether or not they are disabled. It is right to say that at least half of any council or commission should be people with a disability. That would almost certainly lead to a majority being people with a disability, thus meeting the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon, because the commission would need only to have an odd number of members for "at least half to mean a majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, a requirement of "at least three-quarters" would narrow the range of people who could be drawn on for membership—unnecessarily and perhaps unfairly. It goes much further than the constitution of any of the organisations that I mentioned, so I am inclined to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee. The schedule provides that both the chairman and the deputy chairman will be disabled people. I am generally concerned about being overly prescriptive, and that provision is too prescriptive. It would be better if either the chairman or the deputy chairman were disabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principle behind the amendment is similar to that behind amendment No. 96. The arguments will therefore be the same, as will my objections to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the proposals for the inclusion of disabled people on the commission, there are proposals for authorised representatives of disabled people. The Minister said that many disabled people's organisations operated under the 50 per cent. principle, so representatives of those organisations can also be included in the 50 per cent. provided for in the Bill. The definition of who the disabled people are does not need to be spelt out at every stage. It would not present me with an ideological problem if the Bill stated that disabled people had to be from disabled people's organisations, but the issue is wider than that. If there is a fear—I do not share it—that disabled people are taking over disabled people's organisations, that should be abated by some of the points that I shall put forward. As with the earlier group of amendments, the experience of disabled people and of people working with or for disabled people operates in opposition to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to comment on the astonishing brevity with which the hon. Member for Beaconsfield moved this group of amendments. All he said was that he supported amendment No. 100 on the grounds that the current schedule is too prescriptive, and then he sat down. Who drafted the amendments? Will the hon. Gentleman tell us at some stage? I am curious to know. The brevity of his comments was astonishing, especially since he had previously moved an amendment that would have prescribed that a certain proportion of the commission should be disabled people. That is prescriptive. At least then, he developed an argument about why he preferred 50 per cent. to 75 per cent. On this occasion, he has simply said that the schedule is too prescriptive and has sat down again. Hence my curiosity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a good reason for the chairman and deputy chairman to be disabled people. The deputy chairman of any organisation must, as the name suggests, deputise for the chairman. An organisation such as the commission is more likely to work effectively and harmoniously if the chairman and the deputy chairman are disabled people. That seems logical to me. The hon. Gentleman might disagree with my argument, but at least I have presented one. He said very little, however, when he moved his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The other amendments are consequential on amendment No. 100. The hon. Gentleman should have

	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
been able to work that out for himself. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East said that we have already had this debate and that the arguments had already been rehearsed, but I shall be happy to repeat them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that was not the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield should answer his question. Who drafted the amendments? Was the hon. Gentleman given any help by the Minister or by anyone in the Minister's Department?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly was not—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The question was not in order. The amendment has been tabled and selected for debate. Its terms are quite clear and, as is set out on the amendment paper, it originates with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. I understand the point that the hon. Member for Monklands, West is driving at, but it is not in order. The author of the amendment is named on the Order Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the strongest possible exception to the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Monklands, West. I am quite capable of drafting amendments and do so regularly, sometimes with the help of the Public Bill Office. In this case, however, I managed to draft the amendments by myself when I was sitting in the Library one day last week. I ask the hon. Gentleman to accept that. It is not that difficult to draft amendments. I have no idea, however, whether the amendments are technically correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I unreservedly accept that. That explains why the amendments have been drafted so badly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are in danger of enjoying ourselves, and I should not like that to happen. Can we simply consider what the amendments are about, not who wrote them, where they were written and what inspiration drove the hon. Gentleman to table them? If we avoid those matters, we might make progress with the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite surprised that these inoffensive amendments have generated so much heat and not much light. I said that I was concerned about the prescriptive nature of the schedule, which gives details of the composition of the Disability Rights Commission. I examined each of the paragraphs carefully to determine what could be done to introduce greater balance and to ensure that the public interest was properly reflected in the composition of the commission. I tabled the amendments accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of amendments is the least important. It might be right for the chairman and the deputy chairman of the commission to be disabled people or to be drawn from organisations which represent disabled people. I have no difficulty with that. The problem is that the schedule imposes that requirement on the Secretary of State whether he likes it or not. It does not allow him to make the decision and does not allow him any discretion in the matter. He, or she, should be allowed to take a view about whether both the chairman and the deputy chairman should be disabled people. I do not, however, feel as
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
strongly about that as I do about other matters, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment is concerned with drafting. As we discovered last week, there are weaknesses here and there in the Bill. Who knows, it may have been drafted by the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) one evening in the Library. It is a small, technical amendment, aimed at greater clarity. It is generally accepted in other legislation that we talk about an employer, which is less subjective than referring to the employer. I hope that the amendment will find favour with the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 86, in page 4, line 35, leave out "conditions and privileges" and insert "and conditions".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is also a drafting amendment, but it covers a slightly more important point than does amendment No. 9. The amendments are not an attempt to change the meaning of the Bill. I have tabled them to enable me to ask the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East to explain what he means by the terms "employee consultation" and "privileges of employment", which are not in general use in employment legislation in this country. It is likely that employers, employees and, in the event of disputes, industrial tribunals would find it difficult to interpret them in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms are used in the Americans with Disabilities Act, but that does not justify their use in the United Kingdom legislation. We can do better than slavish adherence to terminology from other countries and we should be especially careful in adopting unfamiliar terms from the laws of other countries. It would be better to change the provisions to accord with more customary usage. That is the spirit of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It looks as if the Minister aims to reduce the areas in which disability provisions would operate. In a case of employee compensation following dismissal from work—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is important. Does the hon. Gentleman mean compensation for an act of some sort, such as dismissal from work? Is that what the Bill means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Compensation for dismissal should be calculated for a disabled employee in the same way as for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>
anyone else. If we delete that provision, compensation could be dealt with differently in respect of disabled people qualified under this measure. Someone could get compensation from work because of further disabilities suffered within the work process which made it impossible to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many provisions are associated with privileges of employment. Hon. Members enjoy many privileges, which might be seen to be necessary for the job, but which are nevertheless important extras which alter our lifestyle in some way—for example, overseas visits. The term "privilege of employment" thus has a meaning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that if one disagreed with the social chapter, it would be relevant to try to remove the provision from the Bill? Otherwise, what my hon. Friend means by the conditions and privileges of employment is clear. If staff are given overalls, for example, disabled staff should not be discriminated against by not getting them. If staff in the House are—quite rightly—provided with transport in the evening after a certain time, then there should be no discrimination against people who are disabled. I think that the provision would meet with much support, and my hon. Friend would surely agree that we have not heard a case for removing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that we have. The Minister's argument is that the terms are superfluous, because they are already covered by other items in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My argument is that the terms are misleading and that they are terms not generally used in employment law in this country. I would have no objection to the insertion of other terms which were meant to mean whatever the hon. Gentleman is trying to mean. That is why I asked him what he meant. I am not arguing with the intent of the clause, merely with its terminology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been trying to explain the intent. It may be that the Minister feels that that intent would be catered for by different wording, but presumably that means that he would not want to proceed with the amendments, because an intention, which in our view is covered by the words in clause 4, would thereby be deleted from the Bill. He may think that he could ask people in his Department to draft the clause rather differently but to keep its intention. If he feels that, presumably he must withdraw his amendments with a view to tabling further amendments—when the Bill finally reaches its long-awaited Report stage—which elaborate our intentions insofar as we can put them forward in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the Minister's logic. He does not like the specific wording, but if that were the only argument, my hon. Friend has shown that he is willing to accept the technical amendments, and that did not happen in other Committees of which we have had experience. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> No amendment was accepted at all in one other Committee. If the Minister does not like the wording, and thinks that it could be made clearer and that it might be ambiguous and misunderstood, is not there an obligation on him to produce new wording?
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
Instead of that he has recommended to the Committee that we delete the whole lot. That is not acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. If our arguments about employee compensation and the privileges of employment are held to be inadequate in some way, the intention behind them must be upheld in an alternative draft. Until that is done, I am satisfied with the current form of words. If the amendment is pursued, I think that the real intention is to prevent certain sectors from being covered by the Bill. That would be very unfortunate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very concerned about the amendments, not least the one that seeks to change line 35 on page 4 which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"other terms, conditions and privileges of employment."</p></blockquote>
At an earlier sitting, Mr. Hogg, you told the Committee that you were involved in protecting members of staff in local authorities. A case was referred to me by the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation of a woman who, against stiff competition, won a senior post on the administrative staff of a major police authority. The disabled woman had been told that although she was being appointed she would not be admitted to the superannuation scheme. There was no reason at all on medical grounds why she should be excluded. I speak as the chairman of the managing trustees of the parliamentary pension scheme and I know a little about superannuation schemes. In the case referred to me, there was blatant discrimination against a person on grounds of her disability and I think that it would be dangerous to remove the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment."</p></blockquote>
Happily, in that case, the then Minister with responsibility for disabled people worked with me to reverse the decision made by the police authority. That did not happen quickly. It happened after a great deal of anguish on the part of a disabled woman who, quite frankly, had enough to do without suffering preventable discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will agree that there are dangers in deleting the words to which I referred. Amendment No. 86 changes those words. Organisations of and for disabled people will be extremely concerned to keep those words in the Bill. I ask the Minister to accept that it is sometimes better to talk not in terms of precept or generalities but in terms of actual cases. I provided one case which caused me concern and which is the source of my anxiety about the amendments under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I explained that the amendments were directed at obtaining for the Committee an explanation of certain terms and I am glad that I moved them. They have revealed something important. Everything that the right hon. Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Morris) spoke about—he was right to remind the Committee of cases such as the one that he described—is covered in British employment law by the phrase "terms and conditions". It does not need the word "privileges" added, and my fear is that that word could be misleading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My greater concern was about the term "employee compensation". If I understood the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East correctly, he said that that was to do with compensation by an employer for an act such as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
dismissal. That is not how the term is interpreted in the Americans with Disabilities Act; that is not what compensation means in the United States. In the United States legislation from which the proposals are lifted, compensation means remuneration—wages. It means something quite different to what the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East explained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the type of difficulty of interpretation to which I am drawing the Committee's attention. The hon. Gentleman's response demonstrated the wisdom of doing so. The drafting of the clause would need attention if the Bill were to come anywhere near the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that wages and remuneration in British law would be covered by the terms and conditions provisions. Therefore, provisions for compensation cannot merely repeat those provisions. That would be tautological. Compensation provisions must be separate, but the fact that there is a difference between the American and British approaches does not mean that there is no room for the Bill's interpretation of compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the Committee is more or less confused now, given that that was not the explanation offered by the hon. Gentleman the first time round. People working for American firms in this country certainly regard employee compensation as being about wages and remuneration, and not about compensation in the way that the hon. Gentleman described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no disagreement at all between us about intent: we, too, would want the provision to cover all circumstances. But the terminology that has been borrowed from the United States is not used in United Kingdom law. It would be interpreted in different ways by different people, as our debate has demonstrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East will consider the string of terms used again, with a view to revising them at any later stage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment, and not one that I would want to press to a Division. It deals with clause 4(2)(b), a rather bewildering piece of drafting, which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"participating in any contractual or other arrangement or relationship the implementation of which has the effect of subjecting a qualified disabled person who is an applicant for employment or a qualified disabled person who is an employee to discrimination prohibited by this Act".</p></blockquote>
I am genuinely unsure what that provision covers. I should be grateful for an explanation, and the amendment offers an opportunity for clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole of clause 4(2) deals with conditions of discrimination which are ruled out by the Bill. Subparagraph (2)(b) refers to the drafting of contracts and other terms and conditions of employment which cannot be interpreted in such a way as to allow discrimination. I am not clear as to the difficulty in the mind of the Minister. He has told us that it is badly drafted, difficult to understand and in need of explanation. But I have already explained the general principle without going into masses of contracts and different work arrangements. That should satisfy the Minister's peculiar blockage on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman envisage a contractual arrangement whereby an employer, rather than hiring somebody directly, brings in contract labour?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could apply to that area. When someone is employed, there is an employment contract. It may be a contract entered on the person's behalf by trade unions or other bodies and it sets out rights and obligations at work. It is crucial that such contracts are not drafted in a discriminatory way. As I said, I do not understand the Minister's difficulty.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could do with a more specific example of what is intended, but I understand the general meaning.

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a more substantial and more important group of amendments. Amendments Nos. 88, 89 and 18 relate to the obligation that clause 4(2)(e) would place on an employer
	<br><blockquote><p>"to make reasonable accommodation for the … physical or mental limitations of a qualified disabled person".</p></blockquote>
As drafted, the Bill refers to "known" physical or mental limitations, which raises immediate questions. First, known by whom, and secondly, how clearly must they be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
known? In place of this vague and ambiguous formulation, amendment No. 89 would establish clearly that the relevant issues are whether the employer knew or whether he could reasonably have been expected to know about the relevant limitations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unacceptable to leave open the possibility that employers might be found to have breached the legislation when they were not even aware that a specific employee or applicant for employment was disabled. The amendment would make the Bill more beneficial for disabled people. If the limitation had to be known, it seems that it would be a potential defence for an employer to claim that he did not know. But if the test involved a reasonable expectation of knowing—that the employer could reasonably have been expected to know—the potential loophole could be closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Slightly prematurely, I should draw the Committee's attention to clause 5 which, if enacted as it stands, would restrict an employer's ability to gain information about an employee's state of health or medical status. We shall have to return to how that sits with these considerations. I should like to know how an employer is supposed to comply with the requirement to make reasonable accommodation, as provided for in clause 4(2)(e) when clause 5 would prevent the employer from asking questions to establish exactly what accommodation was required or would be reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 18 deals with a different subject. It would delete from clause 4(2)(e) the qualification that accommodation should be made without unduly prejudicing the operation of an employer's business. I have no problem with the requirement for an employer to make reasonable accommodation for a disabled person. The same type of concept is included in the Government's Disability Discrimination Bill. The problems arise when employers are expected to determine whether the accommodation will unduly prejudice the operation of their business. That would be a more demanding requirement than the Disability Discrimination Bill's concept of steps that are reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. It could mean that an employer could be put under a considerable financial burden or it could even put at risk the jobs of other employees in the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal could mean that in understanding their obligations, employers would have to grapple with two concepts which are not easy to reconcile: whether the accommodation was reasonable, which seems fair enough, and whether the accommodation would unduly prejudice their business, it might be argued that an employer has to do only what is reasonable, but it is then hard to understand what role there is for the "unduly prejudice" part of the duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am especially concerned about the "unduly prejudice" test. For example, a small but profitable firm might be required to install a passenger lift at a cost of, say, £100,000. Such a payment might not unduly prejudice the firm, but would it be fair and right? What about large multinationals or Government Departments? would tribunals find accommodations which cost many hundreds of thousands of pounds reasonable because they did not unduly prejudice the operation of the business? We say that steps which prejudiced a business could not possibly be reasonable, so the concept of reasonable is sufficient
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
on its own. I will deal with factors that should decide the issue of reasonableness when we debate amendments Nos. 28 and 29.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's firm view is that the duty on an employer to make an adjustment or accommodation should provide a fair balance between what we can legitimately ask of employers on the one hand and the needs of disabled people on the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 20, 21 and 22 seek to modify clause 4(2)(g)—the provision relating to selection criteria adopted by employers in recruiting for employment. They have the effect of replacing the requirement that such criteria should be "shown to be" essential to the position in question with the much more reasonable proposition that this should be a matter for the employer's judgment, with the proviso that it is reasonable for the employer to hold the opinion that the criteria are essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employers' recruitment arrangements are essentially a matter for them to determine. For Parliament to seek to constrain their freedom of action beyond what it is necessary to secure the legitimate aims of the Bill is unwarranted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 23 addresses a similar point. It would delete from the Bill clause 4(2)(h), a provision which would in effect require employers in selecting and administering employment tests to use only those which are most likely to reflect accurately the skills or aptitude of a disabled employee or prospective employee. That is a very severe test indeed, and one which seems a little unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have discussed on the previous amendments, the Government consider that matters such as those are most appropriate for employers themselves to determine, based on their particular business needs, provided, of course, that they do not act in a discriminatory manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several subjects are raised by the group of amendments. I have set them out briefly. As will have been gathered from my remarks, my principal concern in this group of amendments is to improve the Bill and make it more workable, particularly with regard to the use of the term "known", which is currently extremely unclear. I should like the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East to respond to the other points that I raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several detailed points have been made, and they give a rather scholastic impression. It is important to examine them, but getting to grips with how they affect the Bill presents difficulties. The Minister seems to be on his own wavelength and I have some difficulty getting onto it. None the less, I shall approach the amendments as best I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments change the employer's defence in the Bill. At present there is a need to consider factors that would unduly prejudice the operation of his business, such as costs. Considerations elsewhere in the Bill about reasonableness and what the employer can reasonably be expected to know would also be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister dealt quickly with amendment No. 23, which removes the requirements on the selection and administration of tests concerning employment. That is a serious deletion. I know that the subsection contains elements that the Minister dislikes, such as the reference
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
to sensory skills. It would be possible, however, for tests to be structured and administrated by employers in such a way that they would weed out the disabled applicant. Therefore the provisions in the subsection are an important means of defending that applicant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend on the way in which he has refused to be patronised by the Minister. He took careful advice before drafting the provision. If he were unwise enough to accept the Minister's amendment, the heart would be taken out of this section of the Bill. That would be in complete conflict with the American experience, which the Minister has seen to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would be in great difficulty if the amendments were accepted. We must consider how the Bill would read if the amendments were included, not the Minister's highly convoluted arguments, which offer alternative views of the employer's role and of what he can know in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 89 would replace provisions concerning known physical and mental limitations, although some of the terminology used in them has crept back into the amendments. The employer's defence revolves around the likely impact on his business when he makes adjustments for the disabled person. If we interfere with mat, we interfere with the principle of the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should also be noted that amendments to clause 4 have already been rejected. They would have removed—throughout—the term "qualified disabled person". The Bill is based on the notion that a person who has a disability but who is qualified to do a job should be entitled to be dealt with equally and fairly by an employer but that the employer should be able, to the extent that he can develop provisions, to have a defence of reasonable cost. I think that the structure of the Bill allows for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is attempting to remove some of the protections in connection with tests and to amend other areas so as to begin to shift the ground away from those principles by claiming to place the qualified disabled person in a better position than would otherwise be the case. The Bill's balance is correct. If we start interfering with one part, the amendments before amendment No. 23 begin to represent a serious withdrawal of rights, as does amendment No. 23 itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can illustrate the difficulty that I am worried about and ask the hon. Gentleman to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4(2)(e) uses the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"failing to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental limitations of a qualified disabled person".</p></blockquote>
What will the commission do when an employer says that he did not know about the physical or mental limitations? Should we provide instead that if the employer could reasonably have been expected to know, then he should not have a defence? At the moment he has a defence if he claims not to have known. That is the most important point that my amendments raise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is much easier in law to determine what the known physical and mental limitations of a
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
disqualified person are than to be able to say what could reasonably be expected to have been known. Surely it is better to have laws that are easier for courts to interpret than laws that are obscure? I therefore want to stand by my initial position, although I understand the Minister's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that it is a defence for an employer to say that he did not know about the person's physical or mental limitations and that they are therefore not known? I am trying to get clear whether that would be a defence under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the position that the Minister is attempting to make clear elsewhere in different amendments—what the viewpoints of the employer would be. The question is, what are the known physical and mental limitations? There is therefore a duty on the employer to take reasonable action to understand the position of the disabled person. So it is not just a case of the employer not bothering to find anything out, so that he could claim that he knew nothing and therefore had a defence in law. The physical and mental limitations and the characteristics of the qualified disabled people will be clear and established; it is not a matter of something not being known because of the employer's failure to understand. It is reasonable to expect the courts to take that into account. Given the Minister's enthusiasm for supplying all sorts of information to employers to explain the position, I am sure that he will go ahead and produce the leaflets, information and videos that would act in conjunction with the provision. I also believe that he knows what we are saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is useful to have the hon. Gentleman's interpretation of the Bill. I entirely take him at his word on what he meant, although I am not sure that a tribunal would find the meaning of the clause, particularly subsection (2)(e), so clear. There would be great room for argument in industrial tribunal cases about who has to know something in order for it to be known and about the point that I have raised: whether a case could be made that an employer was reasonably expected to know but refused to know. Who would take steps to find that out? It is a most unsatisfactory provision, although clearly it is well intended, and we will have to return to it later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is aware that People First is very concerned about access for those with learning difficulties in whatever legislation emerges from the debates here and elsewhere. He said this morning how difficult it is for him to find objective truth about that part of the Bill. I am sure that he will appreciate that People First, and Simone Aspis in particular, are fully entitled to ask members of the Committee to use every opportunity to press the difficulties that people have in regard to understanding our debates and our intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. People First has done much good work and the right hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to it. However, I think that it would be in that group's interests, and in the interests of the people it sticks up for, for it not to be a defence that an employer did not know about the physical or mental limitations of a disabled person. That is my quarrel with subsection (2)(e), but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, amendment No. 24, in page 5, line 26, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) Subsection (1) does not apply to any term, condition or privilege of employment comprising the provision of a benefit by the employer if the employer is concerned with the provision (whether or not for payment) of benefits of that description to the public, or to a section of the public which includes the employee in question, unless—

	<ol>

	<li>that provision differs in a material respect from the provision of the benefits by the employer to his employees; or</li>

	<li>the provision of the benefits to the employee in question is regulated by his contract of employment; or</li>

	<li>the benefits relate to training.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2B) In subsection (2A) "benefits" includes facilities and services.".</p></blockquote>
This is another important amendment. The Bill is silent on its application in the case of a disabled employee being discriminated against by his or her employer in respect of benefits, including facilities and services which the employer provides to members of the public. The amendment aims to clarify the matter and to avoid confusion and overlap between different parts of the Bill by specifically providing that action for redress by an employee is to be taken under part IV of the Bill, covering discrimination in the provision of services, rather man under part III, which covers discrimination in employment. In other words, the employee in those circumstances would be taking action as a customer rather than as an employee, so that the discrimination took place in his role as a customer, so to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three exceptions specified. The first is where the provision of the benefits to members of the public differs in a material respect from their provision by the employer to his employees. The second is where the provision of the benefits to the employee in question is regulated by his or her contract of employment. The third is where the benefit relates to training. In those three circumstances, the discrimination would clearly be taking place in the sphere of employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, the Minister rightly emphasised the importance of consultation, and here we have an important amendment that would involve employers. Can the Minister give the Committee the views of the Confederation of British Industry or the Employers Forum on Disability?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to think that it is possible to consult on all amendments to a Bill that one might table, but I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has consulted a wide range of organisations on every amendment that he has ever tabled—I suspect not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that Mr. Hogg would rule me out of order if I went too far, but I remind the Minister that there was no occasion during our consideration of the Government Bill when I did not produce the support of, for example, the Employers Forum on Disability and the CBI on matters relevant to employment and jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that on occasions the hon. Gendeman, virtually infallible though he is, has not
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
undertaken a national consultation process on amendments that he has tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned not with scoring points, but with the merits of the argument. That is what we should deal with. The approach in the amendment that I am moving is the same as that in the Race Relations Act 1976 and in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. There are good arguments for it, irrespective of who has been consulted. The amendment is helpful and constructive, mirroring the provisions in the Government's Disability Discrimination Bill. I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment begins by stating that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subsection (1) does not apply to any term, condition or privilege of employment".</p></blockquote>
The amendment excludes the provisions dealing with unlawful discrimination by an employer: it excludes a whole category. It men reintroduces some elements of that category. Taken by themselves, the proposed paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) sound reasonably progressive, but only as they apply to terms, conditions and privileges of employment. I note the inclusion in the amendment of the word "privilege", which was said not to be advisable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The word is included solely for the reason that amendments have to relate to the Bill as it exists. That does not detract from the points that I made about privileges earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That means mat, on Report, the word "privilege" will need to be deleted from the part of the Bill that we are discussing as well as from the amendments that we were going to have. The Minister now seeks to insert the word as a procedural arrangement, so that he can take it out later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister produced many of the arguments about the part of the Bill that we are discussing, which concerns rights of employment, because the provision of goods and services are dealt with later in the Bill. What appears on the face of the Bill adequately deals with employment and goods and services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has argued that there is a gap which needs to be covered. But he would create a gap by removing the protection of the legislation from employees' rights to reestablish the three points contained in (a), (b) and (c). Given that we are not just dealing with clause 4 by itself, because other aspects of goods and services will come later, the Minster's fears are unwarranted. The provisions of the Bill are adequate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised by the hon. Gentleman's reaction because, as I have said, such a provision is to be found in other anti-discrimination legislation. The Opposition did not object to such a provision in the Government's Disability Discrimination Bill. That was presumably because it was accepted during the passage of earlier legislation that such provisions made something clear that should be made clear. It should be made clear that if an employee of Marks and Spencer, for example, is discriminated against while working in an office upstairs, his or her recourse is through part III of the legislation. But if he or she goes downstairs to the shop, buys something on the way out and is discriminated against, his or her recourse should be through part IV, unless what he or she is doing while using the facilities of the shop is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
listed in the amendment or is one of the things to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have supported such an entirely reasonable proposition in all previous anti-discrimination legislation. Given the hon. Gentleman's response, I am not sure why they are not prepared to support such a provision now. If the Opposition were not to agree to such a provision, I should have to return to the matter at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>No. 92, in page 5, line 33, leave out "disabled persons" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"the disabled person in question".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments in this group relate to clause 4(4)(a) of the Bill, which provides that the term "make reasonable accommodation", as used in clause 4(2)(e), includes making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by disabled persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendments is to limit the facilities in question to those that a particular disabled person needs to use to be able to carry out his or her job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to discover exactly how far the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East thinks that employers should be required to go in adapting existing facilities for use by disabled employees or prospective employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that all existing facilities have to be adapted, even where the disabled person concerned may never have to use them, or where it would be quite reasonable to expect the person concerned to use alternative facilities? That would certainly seem to be the effect of the clause as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. Gentleman also suggesting that existing facilities have to be adapted simply on the off chance that a disabled person might be on the premises, rather than to cater to the specific needs of a particular disabled person? Again, that would appear to be the implication of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East to say what exactly he intends in that regard. What does he consider to be reasonable? That is an important point, because the need to adapt existing facilities can influence considerably the cost for employers. The Bill should ensure that costs are incurred only when it is reasonable for them to be incurred, which is the intention underlying the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a peculiarity about the Minister's amendments. He does not stand by the words that they
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
contain or the position that they imply. They are probing amendments to find out the meaning of the Bill. I am not against that, but surely when the probing has taken place the amendments should be defensible. They would limit the requirements to make existing facilities at work accessible to disabled employees when that was necessary for their employment functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Disabled people in the workplace should, as far as is reasonably practicable, have available to them the resources that are available to the rest of the work force in the pursuit of their work. What aspects are we discussing? What about staff canteens and smoking areas? Disabled people should be part of the community in the workplace; they should have the benefit of facilities to enable them to carry out their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that all aspects of the workplace must be adapted and adjusted on the off chance. Other elements of the Bill are relevant. Reasonableness and the costs that would be incurred need to be assessed, and a commission will be set up to monitor such work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a disabled person goes into work, we want to ensure that he or she does so on the same basis as an able-bodied person. Obviously, difficulties will arise in certain circumstances in the same way as difficulties arise in the context of building regulations and other provisions that are referred to later in the Bill. Such matters would need to be taken into account to assess what was reasonable in different circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments detract from the rights that disabled people should have at work. Our discussion might shed some light on the matter, and the Minister might decide to withdraw the amendment and table others later in our proceedings that would not be wrecking amendments. The concept of a disabled worker having the same rights as other workers is important, but practical problems and considerations exist and awkward situations arise. The bias should be towards removing the stumbling blocks, but the cost of doing so might be disproportionate. For example, the canteen might be situated in a place that was difficult for disabled people to reach. It is possible that other arrangements, at least temporary ones, could be made for the disabled person. If that needs elaboration in legislation, an entirely different set of amendments is required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped to ask the hon. Gentleman for further clarification. He and I do not disagree about the intention—that a disabled employee should be able to play a full part in the work force, but if, for instance, a disabled employee worked on the second floor of an office block and the necessary modifications and reasonable adjustments were made to facilitate that, as I hope they would be, does the hon. Gentleman intend that the same firm, which also occupied the third floor, would have to make the same modifications to that floor, even though the employee in question was unlikely to go there and did not have to go there as part of his job?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman agrees with me that it would be unreasonable to expect an employer to modify parts of the premises that the employee did not need to use and was unlikely to use, what is his disagreement with my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
amendment No. 91, which states that the modifications should be those
	<br><blockquote><p>"necessary to enable the disabled person in question to carry out the duties of the employment in question"?</p></blockquote>
I should be grateful for further clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The courts might give a restricted interpretation to the conditions necessary to carry out one's employment functions. Sharing in the work community includes sharing in leisure breaks, meeting other employees and comparing notes about work. That requires people to be drawn together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave an example of a worker who had been employed to work on the second floor of a building, and asked whether it would be necessary for the employer to alter the third floor, which had nothing to do with that worker's task. That is not the intention in the Bill. However, we are discussing legislation that would affect 10 per cent. of the population, so if the firm were a large one, the third floor might have to be adjusted for disabled people to work there. The position of the person working on the second floor might be affected by promotion and other considerations: he might rise to third floor level in the course of his work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that in the United States, which the Minister has visited—whether as a Minister, I know not—the legislation was found to be business-friendly. It has not harmed small firms. The Minister, as my hon. Friend will have heard on many occasions, said that the Bill was copied from American legislation. It was not. That is a libel, outside the House, against some of the people who were involved. We should recall the American experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I firmly believe that the implementation of the legislation will be of considerable value to employers and small business men. The costs involved in adapting areas are sometimes limited and the gains to the work force are considerable. The Minister is testing us with cases in which considerable expenditure would be needed to place a particular disabled worker or in which there are old fashioned works where access has to be provided by lifts or some other means. The Minister asks whether that access must be extended throughout the works because of a single disabled worker. That depends on the part of the works and whether it is part of the area of activity of the disabled worker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That rather misses the point of the legislation and makes it appear that it deals with restricted quota provisions and the occasional disabled person who happens to have been placed here and there under the measures. But the Bill is about disabled people sharing employment opportunities on an equal basis with able-bodied people. There are problems with the adjustments that are needed for that to take place and with encouraging it to develop. there are problems with excessive costs in certain circumstances and with employers who could not afford to take those adjustments at a particular time, although it could occur in the future. The legislation attempts to handle those complexities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
The Minister needs to consider his amendment because it does not deal with the second and third floor problem. It deals with other matters that are part of a person's wider work experiences, which are shared with others. A disabled person should not be put at considerable disadvantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman on a number of points. I agree that any anti-discrimination legislation must be about disabled employees being involved, that it should bring benefits to many employers and that employers should be willing to carry out it provisions. Many of those who employ disabled people should be eager to implement it out because we have seen the benefits that it can bring. My fear about legislation drafted in this way is that it will not achieve those objectives because, as well as creating a willingness on the part of some people, it will create alarm and uncertainty on the part of others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East has not been able to tell us exactly how the legislation would apply. I realise that that would not be possible in every situation, but even on fundamental points he said that it would depend on the works and on the courts. My fear about the legislation is that employers would say that they were not sure that they wanted to do what the legislation asked them to do because the extent of their commitment and costs was not clear and might, under the provisions, be greater than making a modification for a disabled employee to carry out his or her duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should be interested in tackling the alarm and uncertainty of employers. It should be made clear that anti-discrimination legislation need not be feared by employers. They will gain from it. We need a much more positive response from the Minister. He should explain how he will convince employers that the Government's proposals will benefit them. My measure would lead to general benefit and an economic business spin-off, which we shall see when we discuss goods and services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that when the Disability Discrimination Bill is enacted, he will not find the Minister for Social Security and Disabled People lacking in making positive comments to employers and many other people about the reasons for the law and what is expected of them. It is important for all Members of Parliament to follow up anti-discrimination legislation by joining the Government in that sort of campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are great benefits to be had for employers and there is a great pool of talent in the country that has been neglected and wasted. I know that that is common ground in the Committee. However, we must get the details of the legislation right too. We are all in favour of communication campaigns and in persuading employers what to do. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East said that the proposed legislation has to do with 10 per cent. of the population. I hope that it has to do with 100 per cent. of the population. Everybody must change attitudes, and that is what the Government are trying to bring about with the Disability Discrimination Bill. To do that, we must ensure that it is fair and reasonable for everyone.

I do not see what is unreasonable about my amendment. I do not believe that it would cost the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East anything to accept the amendments.
