	<div class='legislation'>Draft Vienna Document (Privileges and Immunities) Order 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr. Douglas Hogg)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That, the Committee has considered the draft Vienna Document (Privileges and Immunities) Order 1991.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection to the order, but I should like to ask a couple of questions. In a funny way, the procedure has highlighted one of the amazing anomalies of the House of Commons. We are debating immunities and privileges to be granted to a variety of people who will be required as inspectors under the Vienna document and under the Stockholm conference document. It is remarkable that neither of those documents has been debated in the House, yet they are of considerable significance and have far-reaching consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, all 35 Foreign Ministers at the Conference on security and co-operation in Europe met yesterday in the wake of these significant and historic documents, yet the House of Commons does not debate them or discuss the issues arising from them. However, we have endless meetings on statutory instruments to give diplomatic immunity to small numbers of people who may come to Britain, usually
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
for no more than a day and sometimes for a matter of hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I give the order every good speed I have no intention of opposing it—I hope that the Minister will comment on that curious anomaly. Perhaps it is a matter that the House authorities and the Select Committee on Procedure might like to examine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.31 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, it is the custom for Ministers to respond immediately to questions raised by Opposition Members. I have not focused my mind on the hon. Gentleman's question, which is the extent to which the House discusses the contents of treaties, rather than confines its attention to various enabling powers which flow from treaties. I do not know the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question, although I accept that it is important. My suspicion is that, on occasions, it is possible to debate the whole text of a treaty. The Opposition could have tabled an Opposition Supply day motion if they were so minded. Perhaps the Government could do likewise—I do not honestly know what the practices and precedents are, although it is an interesting point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will, however, reflect further on the matter and write to the hon. Gentleman about practices and precedents. It is worth reflecting whether we should consider a more open way of discussing the contents of any treaties to which Her Majesty's Government may subscribe. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for focusing on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>

	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Vienna Document (Privileges and Immunities) Order 1991.</p></blockquote></p>
