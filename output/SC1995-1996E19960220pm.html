	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Michael Jack)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a delight to have you in the Chair, Mr. Hogg. Before lunch, I played one over against the Opposition when I dealt with the point that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson) raised. She is sadly not in her place, so I shall postpone my response to her comments about various electronic aspects of self-assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a broad and wide-ranging debate on self-assessment and on clause 115, which deals with record-keeping responsibilities. The main thrust of the argument of the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) was that he would defer self-assessment for up to one year. I should, however, tell him that deferral is not on my agenda—I want to make that absolutely clear. That is because the Government are confident of what they have done, are doing and, more importantly, will do to get self-assessment right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was intrigued by the hon. Gentleman's quotations. I was reminded of part of the communion service, which says, "hear what comfortable words." I want to pray some comfortable words in favour of my side of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Chartered Institute of Taxation, but in 
	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on 5 February its president, Mr. Gerry Hart, said that self-assessment was a "clear and simple" tax that shifts burdens. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new system of self-assessed income tax, which starts on April 6, has been heralded by the Inland Revenue as making the tax system 'clearer and simpler'."</p></blockquote>
We could have no more ringing an endorsement than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> 
	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to temper the hon. Gentleman's enthusiasm to give me another barrage of quotations when I have much better ones to give to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>404</span>
Colin Sharman, the KPMG senior partner, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Recent calls for delay in its implementation"—</p></blockquote>
the implementation of self-assessment—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and re-examination of its scope are misplaced. The project has been well managed by the Revenue with a thorough communication process. Fundamental change of this nature is never easy, but it is well overdue in the UK."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Brodie of TaxAid was quoted earlier. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This … is a major improvement."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Ian Jones of KPMG in Cardiff said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think it will make things easier and simpler for taxpayers after it has bedded down."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire quoted Grant Thornton. The company ought to examine its views because I can counter his Grant Thornton quote with my own. In the 
	<i>East Anglian Daily Times</i> on 3 January, Yvonne Graham of that company told readers of that august newspaper's "Your business page" in "All change on tax laws for 1996":
	<br><blockquote><p>"I believe this really does represent a significant simplification of the old system and, once the new rules are in place, it will he much easier for everybody to understand."</p></blockquote>
There could be no clearer endorsement of the Government's line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could probably exchange quotes with the Minister until the cows come home. Gerry Hart said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After self-assessment, more people will seek professional advice for their tax returns, despite what the Revenue says."</p></blockquote>
I have quotations from 
	<i>The Times</i> and other organisations about the costs. We could exchange quotes for a long time. The fact remains, however, that while most organisations and the Opposition accept that self-assessment is a good thing, they are concerned about the Government's implementation of it. That is the question that the Financial Secretary must address.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That sounds like sour grapes. Because my quotations were of a higher quality than the hon. Gentleman's, he deviates from his argument by admitting that people welcome self-assessment. My quotations show that we are getting implementation right. Let me tell the hon. Gentleman in the same spirit of concord with which he presented his remarks that we are interested in listening to what people have to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the starter for ten. What do the following organisations have in common—the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Law Society, the Law Society of Scotland, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, TaxAid, the British Bankers Association, Payroll Alliance, the Association of Payroll and Superannuation Administrators and the Institute of British Personnel Management?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hunt 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wirral, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are all being consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>405</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There we have it. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West has it in one with no problem. They are all organisations that have been part of the self-assessment consultative committee and have regularly been consulted by the Revenue at every stage of the process. Moreover, the fact that we are proposing to amend the clause is a direct result of listening to practitioners in the field because we want to get it right. Therefore, we are not at all averse to practical criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire spoke about accountants. The profession may be in the business of frightening the horses to some extent because it may pick up an extra client or two. Most responsible accountants—certainly those to whom I have spoken in my constituency—agree that self-assessment is a change that can be coped with. They are managing the change in their usual professional and competent way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) among others touched on the Child Support Agency. It was suggested that self-assessment paralleled that sometimes difficult but important development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it clear that we are not introducing any new taxes into the context of self-assessment. Inland Revenue, as I said when we debated clause 112 on the Floor of the House, comprises some of the most professional and dedicated people with whom I have ever had the pleasure of working. They know their business; they know the volume of business to be transacted; they have been closely involved in specifying the systems required to transact that business; and I have no doubt whatever that they have planned it all in meticulous detail. That is a long way from the description of shoddiness with which the hon. Member for North Warwickshire sought to impugn my friends in the Revenue. Let me tell the Committee for the record what the Revenue has done to put the self-assessment message across.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the main mistake with the Child Support Agency was the failure properly to estimate the length of time required to deal with each case? The degree of non-co-operation by absent parents was grossly underestimated. Will my hon. Friend confirm that the Revenue has a clear idea of how long it will take to administer each case of self-assessment and that it has enough resources to do the job?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I shall make clear, we have already tried the process out—unlike the CSA which was unable to perform a trial run. A trial run took place in Leicester with 5,000 real taxpayers and we intend to conduct another trial run with 13,000 real taxpayers in Southampton. That means that when we go live we shall have a clear idea of what is happening. I can answer my hon. Friend's question clearly—yes, the Revenue does have a clear idea of what is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall outline briefly what has been done. The Revenue has produced a new easy-to-read guide and
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
an audio cassette; and it has explained the new roles to employers. Self-assessment information packs have already been sent to more than a million employers. About 300,000 employers who returned P11Ds have been invited to attend seminars about the new system. By the end of last year, more than 1,500 such seminars had been conducted, attended by 28,000 people representing 19,000 firms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is more, because we want to make certain that the necessary back-up is in place. We are considering setting up telephone helplines in the 400 tax centres around the country. They will be open not only during normal business hours, but will be manned during weekends when people often want advice about completing their self-assessment forms. More information, more advertisements and more trials will be provided. So, we will be doing a great deal during 1996 to make certain that people in the real world know about self-assessment and that we can evaluate it so that by the time that taxpayers receive their returns from I April 1997, the job will be properly sorted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A national opinion survey conducted by the Revenue to check how the efforts were going produced "excellent results". Those are not my words, but those of the national opinion survey, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Over 90 per cent. of employers questioned think Revenue guidance for employers is easy to understand."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire prayed in aid the British Retail Consortium. When I received that organisation's letter, I picked up the telephone and spoke to a representative. The central point at issue was that of back-up for member companies, which were worried that the pay office would not have sufficient information to deal with inquiries from people who wanted to know what self-assessment meant for them. I told the British Retail Consortium that information would be given to companies to assist with that task and that, as I said a moment ago, the 400 tax centres around the country would also make certain that they had the right back-up to deal with such queries. My impression was that the BRC was reassured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like a good auctioneer before the point is going, going, gone, let me add that we are going further: in the next few days, the Revenue will meet the British Retail Consortium further to discuss its opinions. In fact, the two bodies will meet tomorrow to ensure that we have listened to its views. The invitation is open to any organisation with a concern to let us know. I am anxious that we address the real-world effects of the measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have demonstrated that as far as the Revenue is concerned, that very professional and thorough approach could not be described, as it was by the hon. Member for North Warwickshire in deprecating terms, as either bungling or incompetent. I hope that the hon. Gentleman did not mean the Revenue personally and shall take his remarks in a more general sense. The Revenue is very professional, certainly not bungling or incompetent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>407</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concur in many ways with the Minister's strong support for public sector employees who work in the Inland Revenue, but I wonder why he and his colleagues have spent so long trying to privatise various parts of the organisation, sack various members of it and generally put responsibilities in the Bill out to the private sector if they think what they say about the quality of the Revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because the Inland Revenue would be the first to recognise that sometimes others have specialist skills which can be utilised to the benefit of the taxpayer. That is why Electronic Data Systems was selected as the main information technology supplier, not only for self-assessment but for wider Revenue use. The Revenue recognised that that company was a world leader in the sector and one of the few companies capable of handling a project of such size and complexity with the degree of professionalism that it wanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, we were accused of rushing the process, but it actually goes back as far as the Keith committee in 1983. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield dealt in some detail with the several occasions on which the matter has been discussed in the context of Finance Bills and the Budget. I shall not reiterate his points, but the essence of the benefit at the heart of self-assessment and the reason why we want to introduce it, is that about one and a half million appeals a year are made by self-employed people. That palaver will be done away with under self-assessment. About 4 million self-employed taxpayers will find that they will benefit from an altogether simpler system of taxation, which will, ultimately, reduce their costs of compliance. That is to be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we shall see in later clauses, ordinary pay-as-you-earn taxpayers at the higher rate who must fill in a tax form will benefit from being in the driving seat. I made that point earlier and the hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping) picked it up. Such taxpayers will determine their tax situation and will not continually have to refer to the Revenue for permission to do this, that and the other thing before coming to a conclusion about their tax returns. There are good benefits and reasons for our moving forward in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was asked whether everyone would need an accountant because of the scheme. The remarks of the hon. Member for North Warwickshire contained some rather tired and second-hand information. If he had asked me, I could have told him that we had made some significant progress. [
	<i>Laughter.</i>] I am glad that he is now listening and paying attention. The trial in Leicester helped us to simplify and improve the return that people will have to fill in. The Revenue tells me that the average taxpayer will probably have to fill in 15 boxes of information and complete one schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire read out a lot of instructions. Real taxpayers in Leicester who
	<span class='label label-info column'>408</span>
took part in the experiment told me that we had to cut down the paperwork and the complexity to make the form more user friendly. We have done that. The hon. Gentleman will not have had the benefit of seeing the simplier form, but when he does see it he will realise that we have separated the calculation section and the return section. The result is that, for taxpayers who decide that they have completed their self-assessment and who get the information back to the Revenue by the end of September, the Revenue will do the rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taxpayers need not be troubled by complexity in the form if they do not want to do the calculation. If they do want to do the calculation, they can turn to a specially designed calculation book. I have heard it said that self-assessment will do accountants out of business, because ultimately life will be much more straightforward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire accused the Government of having legislation scattered to the four winds. He felt that it would be difficult to deal with self-assessment, even with his reading of great volumes of tax law. I can put his mind at rest: the legislation will be consolidated in one place. That is the purpose of the exercise in the Bill. There will be much more consolidated information available from the Revenue. As was noted, none of that would be possible without the co-operation of the Revenue staff, who are very positive and on-side about self-assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) made a rather Orwellian intervention touching on the subject of rules about record keeping. Those rules apply only to taxpayers' records and not to their advisers. It is the taxpayer who is ultimately responsible for self-assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were various questions about the total numbers of people involved in the work and about the movements of personnel within Electronic Data Systems between work on corporation tax pay and file and self-assessment. I can assure the Committee that the introduction of self-assessment is a top priority for the Revenue, which has adequate resources and staff to achieve that priority. I am confident that it will do so smoothly. As far as movements within EDS are concerned, it is right that an organisation varies its staff deployment according to its priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hillsborough mentioned the question of electronic records and spoke about cowboy programmes for personal computers. She is not in her place, but I can assure her in absentia that the Inland Revenue plans to produce an electronic version of the tax return so that people will be able to complete their returns using an Inland Revenue produced floppy disc.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cheltenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Treasury looked beyond simply providing a floppy disc? The Revenue might end up replacing a paper mountain with a floppy disc mountain. Has the Minister considered the possibility of providing a multi-media system on the information superhighway, so that no electronic media has to be transferred to taxpayers in the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>409</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Revenue is familiar with the question of electronic lodgement of documents, and is considering that in the context of self-assessment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I do not go into detail just now. I shall write to him at greater length about the effect of electronics on self-assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire advanced an argument based on Red Book figures, but I think that we dealt with that argument by means of interventions, and the hon. Gentleman failed to deal adequately with the question that I put to him three times. Anybody who reads the 
	<i>Official Report</i> will know precisely what we meant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked how the Revenue will deal with a taxpayer who might innocently make a mistake. I, too, was concerned about that and I have been assured that the Revenue will be humane, sensible and will, if I may say, operate with a light touch, particularly in the early phase. In any system, however—as one of my hon. Friends noted—there have to be penalties to ensure that the people who do not play by the rules—they are the minority—are brought to heel. If the majority plays by the rules, the minority must be brought into line. That is why there will be penalties, which will be carefully and appropriately applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt with the points that were raised in the debate. The change is a large one but it is being professionally managed. I am anxious to listen to anyone with good practical suggestions as to how we can make it better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, we will not see big bang day for the tax system on 1 April 1997. The new scheme will come in gradually and people will have time to fill in their self-assessment forms and make their inquiries, even if ultimately they want the Revenue to calculate their tax return for them. As for companies, they have all the way until 1998 before we introduce self-assessment for them. I am confident that it can be properly introduced and that is why I hope members of the Committee will agree that clause 115 should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 112, in page 82, line 12, leave out "to such extent as he thinks fit" and add
	<br><blockquote><p>"on such basis as is just and reasonable.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(4B) a person who is dissatisfied with the repayment decision made by the officer under paragraph (b) of subsection (4A) above.
	<span class='label label-info column'>410</span>
may appeal to the Commissioners having jurisdiction on an appeal against the assessment or the amendment of the self-assessment".</p></blockquote>
Your enthusiasm, Mr. Hogg, almost carried you away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have just heard the Financial Secretary say—and I was glad to hear it—that he was anxious to listen to practical suggestions that would make self-assessment better. The amendment contains a couple of practical assessments. They are supported by the Institute of Chartered Accountants and by the Chartered Institute of Taxation, both of which think the amendment would be useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 118 amends the rules in section 59B of the Taxes Management Act 1970, which enable tax shown as repayable on a return and self-assessment to be repaid to the taxpayer. The clause inserts a new subsection (4A) into section 59B of that Act, which will override the repayment provisions where an officer of the board—for example, an inspector—has commenced inquiries under section 9A, which concerns the power to inquire into returns. In such cases, the repayment will be delayed until the end of those inquiries and the officer is empowered to make provisional repayment.
	<br><blockquote><p>"to such extent as he thinks fit."</p></blockquote>
That is the key issue. The wording seems to convey enormous discretion to an officer of the board. Indeed, the test seems to be almost subjective, which leads me to my first question to the Financial Secretary. Does not the wording of the clause make the test subjective? It gives the Inland Revenue a wide discretion and, therefore, a wide power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Inland Revenue will want discretion and power: the state and its instruments always do. It is, however, our job as Members of Parliament to control any overweening power of the state and its bureaucracy and to ensure that the Administration take account of individual citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Inland Revenue already has wide powers, and we are in danger of giving it more. The Labour party seeks to fetter and direct that power so that it is used on a just and equitable basis. That is an entirely reasonable way of approaching the matter. The Conservative party says that it is opposed to the excessive power of the state. Well, here is an opportunity to prove it by providing a clause that restricts the Inland Revenue's discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chartered Institute of Taxation is clear. In its representations to us on clause 118, it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposed TMA 1970 Section 4A as currently drafted is inequitable in that the officer of the Board takes the decision 'as he thinks fit' with no corresponding right of appeal being given to the taxpayer.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The taxpayer could be due a large refund, but there may only be a small amount of tax at stake during the enquiry. In this situation giving the Inspector the power to cancel the repayment until enquiries were completed is inequitable and cannot he the intention of the provision.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>We suggest that the wording 'to such extent as he thinks fit' be amended as it is too wide and gives the Inspector too much discretion. As an alternative. an appeal mechanism against the Inspector's decision is required.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>411</span>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants agrees. In paragraph 174 of its representations to us, it says that new section 4A
	<br><blockquote><p>"allows an inspector to determine the size of a provisional repayment as he thinks fit: we consider that he should make the repayment on such basis as is just and reasonable."</p></blockquote>
We have examined the wording of the clause and have tabled the amendment. I hope that the Minister will consider it a reasonable amendment and a practical suggestion that is in line with the philosophy of both our parties and with the philosophy of all hon. Members. We should ensure that the power of the state over the individual is controlled, is subject to proper legislative reasonableness and is equitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appeal mechanism proposed in the amendment would be accessible and would enable people to appeal against the decision of the officer of the board. At the moment, the only way in which an appeal against an assesssment can be made is by judicial review. The cost of judicial review is enormous. Whenever my clients said that they wanted to seek judicial review, I asked them whether they had £10,000 to spare. Legal aid is rarely available to people who want to appeal taxation decisions. A trader or a self-employed person might find that judicial review is not feasible. The amendment would provide an appropriate right of appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that that would mean delay and extra cost. My answer to that is that justice and democracy sometimes require delay and cost. It is a price worth paying to get it right for the individual citizen. That is why we propose the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This area of Revenue activity deals with a comparatively rare set of circumstances in which the Revenue has clear doubts about the validity of a repayment of tax. It deals with the itinerants of this world who may be here today, but gone the day after tomorrow. The Revenue wants to be certain that if it has any doubts about an individual's self-assessment return it can, before it pays any money back, make such inquiries as it feels are necessary. Since it would obviously have suspicions before making such inquiries, it would want to protect its position by withholding the rapayment. It is important to make it clear that that is a fairly rare event. The hon. Member for North Warwickshire has made two proposals that he believes would benefit the taxpayer in such circumstances, but I hope that he realises that the kind of taxpayer we are talking about is one who might not unreasonably arouse suspicions in the mind of a seasoned inspector—hence the inquiry. He suggested that the current test, which involves the inspector acting as he thinks fit, should be replaced by one that is defined as "just and reasonable" and that there should be an appeal right. Under the current arrangements, which have served us well, an individual taxpayer can if he wishes make an administrative appeal and say that he believes an inspector is being unreasonable. He can put his arguments to the inspector. There is nothing in the current or proposed procedures that would prevent an inspector, having heard those arguments, making a repayment to the taxpayer concerned. That system guards against frivolous inquiry. Also, if the
	<span class='label label-info column'>412</span>
individual so wishes, he can go to the commissioners and complain through that procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A procedure that has served us well does not need to be changed, but in the spirit of helping the hon. Gentleman, I can tell him that we could try to find some middle ground even if I cannot accept his amendment. A publication of instructions to the Revenue staff would be helpful, connected with the publication of a code of practice on inquiries, covering how they would be expected to deal with matters covered by the clause. That would demonstrate that the Revenue would be expected to take a visibly reasonable approach, balancing the needs of the taxpayer and the Exchequer and giving aggrieved taxpayers a clear route of redress. I also give him the undertaking that the course of action that I recommend the Revenue follows is the subject of consultation with the self-assessment advisory committee so that we will ensure that the code is based on real-world input, which would address the hon. Gentleman's concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that we are trying to achieve the delicate balance between respecting the natural suspicions of the inspector that have led to an inquiry and the taxpayer's rights to have his reasonable arguments listened to, without upsetting a system that has served us well. I urge my right hon. and hon. Friends to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious that the Minister is trying to be helpful and I appreciate that. There is a semblance of consensus about how that might be approached. We would welcome a recognition by the Government that the Inland Revenue's discretion may have to be circumscribed and that the publication of the terms of any decision would be undertaken as soon as possible after the appropriate consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would acknowledge the points contained in the amendment, but although I understand what the Financial Secretary said about the officer reconsidering the matter, that does not amount to an appeal to the commissioner. However, in practice, individual taxpayers may be able to get changed what they regard as unjust. To that extent, the Financial Secretary appears to have accepted the gist of the direction that we want to go in without accepting the terms of the amendment.

	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are intended to probe the Government's reasoning, but we will take the Minister's response into account when we decide how to proceed. The Chartered Institute of Taxation and the Institute of Chartered Accountants have raised a number of valid questions about the clause, and the notes on clauses do not fully justify the proposed changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The complexities of the clause and of schedule 16 reveal the difficulties of marrying existing reliefs designed under the old system with the new self-assessment regime. The notes on clauses show that various changes must be made to the reliefs to make them work under self-assessment, but we need a more detailed outline of the reasoning behind the decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Faculty of Taxation and the Chartered Institute of Taxation have submitted representations to the effect that many of the changes go beyond what is necessary for the introduction of self assessment. They point especially to subsection 10 of the clause, which deals with the proposed reduction of the time limit for literary and artistic works from six years to 22 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour amendments Nos. 113 to 116 would retain a longer time limit for such claims by changing the claim period to five years from the first anniversary of the normal filing date, in line with general long time limit for self-assessment. We do not understand why there is a difference between the provisions in the clause and the general long time limit for self-assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes are important. In considering them, we must not reduce taxpayers' rights without a full explanation from the Minister as to why the changes are being introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could give a short answer. We discussed the matter with the representative bodies. I am advised that none of those bodies could provide any examples of a person being significantly disadvantaged by the proposed change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>414</span>
At the heart of many of the issues that we will have to deal with on self-assessment is the question of tax treatment for a self-employed person or a business, which will be a decided on a current-year basis. Therefore, we must adapt practices such as farmers' averaging and literary spreading to the new system without taking away the advantages that those measures tried to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do such measures exist? They were introduced in an era when marginal tax rates were very high indeed, but I shall not entertain the Committee with a debate on that subject—we have already had one. The measures were designed to cope, for example, with income accrued by a person of an artistic bent who wrote a blockbuster novel that initially did not sell but which became a raging success a few years later. Before spreading was introduced, if a large sum of money arrived at a time of high marginal tax rates, all the fruits of previous labours could be dissipated before the author's eyes as the texman took a large slice of the action.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend will continue his duties in his own inimitable style. He has just made a helpful contribution about farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the central issue, the facilities of literary spreading and farmers' averaging were designed to assist in coping with a tax system that would have taken away one-off gains. We have tried to adapt those ideas to self-assessment by bringing the timetable for the decision to be made in line with self-assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, a person writes a novel and is waiting for it to be snapped up by a publisher who will pay a lot of money. Perhaps one, two or three years elapse before the money suddenly comes along. In the year when the money arrives such authors now have up to 22 months to decide whether to take advantage of the literary spreading procedures. They do not lose out on any of the time scale available, but they must make their minds up. They have had three years while they waited for the great event to occur to consider the consequences and they can further reflect that while they have been thinking, tax rates have come down under Conservative Governments, as we all know. Once the money arrives, authors have a further 22 months from the end of the tax year to make a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
decision. If the blockbuster was finished at the beginning of a tax year, they would have had three years to think about that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to adapt that point in the context of self-assessment. We take nothing from people who want to take advantage of averaging or spreading—time limits on how they can spread or average remain the same, but the decision-making process has been adapted to self-assessment. Given that nobody could find an example of anybody who would be seriously disadvantaged by the measure when we consulted on it, I think that we have the balance about right and I suggest that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire seek the Committee's leave to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to discuss amendments Nos. 117 and 118 separately from amendment No. 119, which deals with a slightly different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 117 and 118 deal initially with clause 119(6), which removes the ability of certain claims to spread income to be made by partnerships and companies. Subsection (6) provides that certain claims are no longer applicable to companies or partnerships, namely under section 534 of the Taxes Act 1988, which deals with the backward spreading of receipts on the assignment of a copyright in the first two years after publication. Section 535 deals with forward spreading of receipts on the disposal of a copyright 10 or more years after first publication. Section 537A deals with backward spreading of receipts on the assignment of a design; and section 538 with backward spreading of receipts by a painter, sculptor or other artist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notes on clauses seek to justify the exclusion on the grounds that the provisions are not designed for companies and that the concept of spreading partnership sums is no longer workable because assessments will be made on partners rather than partnerships under self-assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a full explanation of the reasoning behind that. The notes do not justify why the change is being made. Important changes require far more explanation than we have received in the notes on clauses. In support, I quote again from the Chartered Institute of Taxation. paragraphs E.4.I and 2 state:
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do not accept that the spreading provisions for copyright payments were not to he applied to companies or partnerships. Companies were originally subject to income tax and the reason for the spreading provisions was surely to prevent the bunching of income in a single year, which was actually earned over a longer period, as a result of which, income is over-taxed because of the progressive rates of tax applicable. This still applies to companies who, if it were not for spreading provisions, might fall into the standard or marginal rates of corporation tax, whereas under the spreading provisions, they might remain within the small companies' rate. Similarly, in the case of partnerships, exactly the same progressive rates apply as for individuals."</p></blockquote>
The passage points out that authors and song writers often seek to be employed by small companies that are set up to take advantage of pensions provisions and to give commercial protection from the hazards of libel action. I might add that I spoke to a solicitor last night who told me that he had embarked on a similar relationship, employing himself in a company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Song writing is often carried out through partnerships. The Chartered Institute of Taxation views it as iniquitous that spreading provisions do not apply. It suggested that clause 119 (6) be removed from the Finance Bill in order to preserve the spreading provisions for both companies and partnerships. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has a broadly similar view of partnerships. In paragraph 176 of its submission, it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 119 (6) removes the ability of certain claims to spread income to be made by a partnership: we cannot see the justification for withdrawing this relief."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 118 is an alternative to amendment No. 117. If one is accepted, the other falls. It depends on the Minister's explanation. We seek to reverse the exclusion only of companies from the spreading provisions. Once again, we seek an explanation from the Minister about how companies will be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 119 deals with clause 119 (7), which abolishes existing relief that may be claimed when a copyright holder dies or ceases his profession. The balance of any copyright income, which was spread forward under section 535 of the Taxes Act 1988, is treated as taxable in the year of death or cessation, subject to an election to spread the income evenly over the years from the first instalment to the year of cessation or death. That election is now abolished, leaving the balance taxable in full in the year of death or cessation. Notes on clauses suggest that that is in line with provisions in the Finance Act 1995 on estates and avoids re-opening prior years. Labour sees no reason for that and wants to probe the logic of the Government's position. The Chartered Institute of Taxation states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We see no logical reason for the amendment in relation to the forward spreading provision relief contained in ICTA 1988 section 535 where copyright is sold after 10 years or more. The reason for the introduction of this relief which was to prevent the bunching of income in the year of death still applies, therefore, the relief should not be withdrawn."</p></blockquote>
As the Chartered Institute of Taxation says, the problem remains. Why, then, is the change taking place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me shine a little light on those issues. The hon. Gentleman may benefit from some clarification on the proposals' operation. He said that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>417</span>
the amendment dealt with literary spreading in the context of companies. I am glad that he made that distinction because it will help the Committee to understand why I am uneasy about the amendments and cannot accept them. Farmers' averaging has always been a matter for the individual farmer, not the company. As debates on this law in the House and perceptions of it since its enactment attest, no one ever thought that it was designed for companies, but for individuals. The amendment asks the Government to include companies and goes beyond what has always been regarded as the purpose of such spreading activity—to deal with the talented individual who gets the lump sum payment, not with the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make that careful distinction because of the point that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire made about his solicitor friend. There is an essential difference between being employed by a company and undertaking a creative work—where the company has the copyright and rights over activities that are associated with the work—and being the sole generator of a piece of creative activity in one's own right. That distinction helps us to understand that, even if the company and the person are one with another, the company employs the the individual and, therefore, decides on the appropriate tax treatment for the employee's creative activity. The individual will not do so, although if he wants to carry out a piece of creative activity, he can do so in his own right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That also explains the position in regard to partnerships. If I may venture into the area of free tax advice, I am told by experts on the subject that it is possible for individuals to arrange their affairs in such a way that, if they want to collaborate like Lennon and McCartney and produce great works for the rest of us mortals to listen to and enjoy, they can reach a personal agreement to do so in collaboration. They can also reach a personal agreement about how to divide the fruits of their labours. When they then examine whether they want to exercise the spreading provisions, they do so individually and outside the terms of their partnership. If they want to have a partnership in which they do other things together, the creative act will not compromise the exercise of partnership for joint benefit in other ways. We should not, therefore, extend the provisions to companies—partnerships can deal with the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should say very quietly to the hon. Member for North Warwickshire, who chastised us for complexity earlier in our proceedings, that his proposals would add immeasurably to the complexity of self-assessment particularly if we were to try to adapt partnership procedures to that point. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that no creative person need be disadvantaged by the proposals, for the reasons that I have given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 119 took us into an even more infrequently used area. Clause 119, to which the amendment was tabled, was designed to make the self-assessment procedure work as simply and as smoothly as possible. One of our aims was to avoid re-opening assessments that have become final. It may
	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>
be argued that that would result in more tax being payable, but the true comparison would be with what the author—in the case of the deceased of whom the hon. Gentleman talked—would have been liable to pay, had he lived. No one could know what that would be, so no one could say definitely that a particular deceased author would have been disadvantaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The forward spreading relief was designed for the benefit of the creator of the work who, QED, is no longer able to benefit because he is dead. The author will have had the benefit of the spreading while he was alive but his death brings that special relief to an end. The provision is rarely used. I think that I can say without contradiction that the original beneficiaries would certainly not be in a position to complain about the matter. Therefore, to avoid complexity and for the reasons that I have given, I advise the Committee to resist amendment No. 119.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sought to catch your eye, Mr. Hogg, before my hon. Friend the Minister spoke, but I still want to make two points, my hon. Friend's speech notwithstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I have been struck by the highly uncritical manner in which the hon. Member for North Warwickshire seems to have adopted wholesale comments that have been made by the Chartered Institute of Taxation or the Institute of Chartered Accountants. I give, as just one example, an obvious contradiction in what the Chartered Institute of Taxation has to say. At one point it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is by no means uncommon for authors and songwriters to he employed by very small companies".</p></blockquote>
However, at another point it seems keen to see that relief because the companies would not otherwise be able to take advantage of the
	<br><blockquote><p>"standard or marginal rates of corporation tax, whereas under the spreading provisions, they might remain within the small companies' rate."</p></blockquote>
One can remain within the small companies rate with profits of up to £300,000 a year. I would not have thought that such companies could be described as "very small" by any stretch of the imagination. Indeed, I do not suppose that that many authors and songwriters earn £300,000 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, spreading provisions—muck-spreading provisions for farmers and copyright spreading provisions for authors—were introduced when we had very high marginal rates. Now that we do not have high marginal rates, could we not make a further simplification by getting rid of the spreading provisions? What is so special about farmers, apart from the fact that they make a lot of noise? Anybody who is in business has fluctuating profits. Why should farmers be singled out to have their profits spread in this way and thus have their tax liability reduced?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I am got at by the farming fraternity to my right, I would say that we had to tread a delicate path in the introduction of self-assessment to ensure that we achieved the right balance in maintaining that which was there before self-assessment, lest people think we had used the new system as an excuse to make changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>419</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield made an important point. It would have been possible under the terms of the self-assessment system to remove the spreading provision but clearly, in the case of farmers, substantial seasonal fluctuations can occur. Perhaps the measure is worthy of retention. I shall consider the matter—as I am sure will everyone—in the context of the work that will be undertaken to simplify the tax system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this occasion, I would not want to be accused of making self-assessment the excuse to deal with the matter. Some people still find the measure advantageous and so our course has been to adapt the provisions to self-assessment in the way suggested. That is why I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield will continue to oppose the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given us some, but not sufficient, elucidation on that point. He said that the provisions were not intended for companies but that where companies did use them, they are not being extended. He also said that companies, not individuals, make decisions in the circumstances that he outlined, but where they are one and the same thing—and where everyone knows that—it is surely right that the same decision can be made.

Where partnerships, or individuals in partnerships, have used the provisions in the past, should not they be able to continue to use them as individuals, so that they do not compile returns as individuals but as two partners in the kind of Lennon and McCartney relationship that the Minister described?

	<div class='title'>PROCEDURE FOR GIVING NOTICES</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have three questions for the Minister which I can put concisely. According to the notes on clauses, clause 121 provides that the procedure for making claims under self-assessment should not apply to notices that taxpayers give to the Revenue. No explanation has been given of why that distinction is now made. Can the Minister provide one?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, one of the "notices" being removed does not appear to require a notice under section 401 of the Taxes Management Act 1988, which provides that
	<span class='label label-info column'>420</span>
relief for pre-trading expenditure "shall" be given—no notice being required. Why are we removing a notice where no notice is needed? Is it that one is needed under different provisions of which I am not aware?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, it is also odd that another "notice" is strictly a claim. A claim is made by a taxpayer, whereas a notice is made by the tax inspector where there is an error or by the taxpayer on appeal. Section 124(a) of the Capital Allowances Act 1990 provides that an initial allowance shall be given on expenditure on agricultural buildings between October 1992 and November 1993, subject to a claim under subsection (6) for a reduced amount. That is presumably a claim rather than a notice—or have I misunderstood?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that if I give the hon. Member for North Warwickshire a general description of the clause, he will apply it to the questions that he asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked three specific questions. It may be useful for the Minister to reply in writing in due course, which may expedite matters now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's spirit of assistance, but I shall make a stab at dealing with his questions. The question of notices was raised in response to consultation. Believe it or not, we listen to what people say. As for giving notices in general, it was deemed easier to do that outside the body of self-assessment. The original thinking was that everything could be dealt with on the assessment, but as we proceeded it became clear that notices would be better dealt with outwith the assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 121 restores the current procedure by which taxpayers give statutory notices to the Revenue—hence the remarks that I have just made. Currently, there is no formal procedure for making those notices, and the clause ensures that that continues under self-assessment. It was originally felt that it would make for a clearer procedure if such notices were made within the body of the self-assessment, but after consultation we decided to restore the more flexible mechanism under which the taxpayer can determine how best to give the notice. That recognises the wide range of circumstances—attested to by the hon. Gentleman's three questions—in which a notice is required under the Taxes Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause simply removes the reference to "notice" in the two provisions related to the procedure for claims under section 42 and schedule 1A of the Taxes Management Act 1970. In the light of further reflection, it seemed sensible to make this amendment. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health commented on these matters in 1994 and said that when it was appropriate we would not hesitate to make a change. I can tell the hon. Member for North Warwickshire that capital allowances require a notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the risk of causing the Minister grave anxiety, I want to comment on his notes on clauses, which refer to a small error being corrected by clause 122. I want to be sure that he did not think that that had slipped by. Clause 122 corrects three errors, does it not, one of which is not small? Without subsection (1) there would have been no provision for applying the interest on overdue tax to partnerships set up before 6 April 1994. The notes on clauses state that the amendment is
	<br><blockquote><p>"to make it clear that it applies to partnerships".</p></blockquote>
However, the wording seems to add a wholly new text to section 110 of the Finance Act 1995 rather than clarify existing language. the usage of the expression
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be deemed to have been enacted"</p></blockquote>
in subsection (1) of the Bill also indicates that a fairly serious error has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) corrects a cross-referencing error in section 110 of the Finance Act 1995. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the words 'section 93' there shall be substituted the words 'section 92'."</p></blockquote>
That is fairly significant. Subsection (3) corrects a further oversight in section 110 of the Finance Act 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses skip over the correction relating to the Bills of Exchange Act 1882. What has happened to that? A lengthy schedule is to be removed—I have a copy of it. What are the implications for paragraph 23(3) of schedule 19, which refers to the Bills of Exchange Act 1882? The notes on clauses say that subsection (2) repeals paragraph 23 of schedule 19 of the Finance Act 1994. Should not that be subsection (3) rather than subsection (2)? The Financial Secretary may feel disposed to write to me on these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are now being treated to a recitation of the various Taxes Acts. I congratulate the hon. Member for North Warwickshire on the elegance of his elocution on these matters. There are always consequences when changes are made. The clause corrects a minor defect in section 110 of the Finance Act 1995 dealing with interest on overdue tax. It affects the rules for charging interest on tax paid late by partnerships in respect of the tax year 1996–97, and ensures that for that year interest is charged on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>
established basis as originally intended, rather than on the new basis that will apply under self-assessment. We might otherwise have been in the position of applying interest, but from a wrong date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that hon. Members would congratulate the Revenue for spotting that and putting it right. The fact that there are some consequential effects as a result of what the hon. Member for North Warwickshire says shows that the matter has been dealt with thoroughly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that a certain amount of repair work is necessary in some places. I do not apologise for that, as it underlines that we want self-assessment to work properly and to be fair to the taxpayer. If we see an error we need the guts to put it right, and to do so in public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would praise the Financial Secretary if he could claim that he had the guts to put an error right.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 120, in page 274, leave out lines 1 to 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not realise that we considered the schedules after the clauses. That seems out of kilter, but never mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chartered Institute of Taxation has expressed anxiety over the schedule, which aims to clarify the interest position where tax is paid late and to enable successive payments made by the board to be recovered by assessment. It has been suggested that the retrospective alteration of one year's liability under paragraph 2(4) will automatically increase the interim payments due for the following year. As a result, it is likely that the actual interim payments will be insufficient, causing a further liability to interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The institute proposes that no interest should be charged where an interim payment is properly paid in the amount due at the date when the payment falls due, unless neglect or fraud is established in respect of additional liability in year one. The amendment would remove paragraph 2(4) from the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister is familiar with the full argument deployed by the Chartered Institute of Taxation, so I will not burden the Committee with the detail. However, it would be helpful if the Minister would explain the situation to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment does not address the real circumstances in which the interest position that the hon. Gentleman has described would be relevant. The hon. Gentleman described the circumstances with reasonable accuracy, but the move to a current year basis means that payments on account relate to yesterday's events—the previous profitability of the business. If a past event has not been accurately recorded, it will affect current year payments on account. If the Revenue found past errors while it was considering a current year's assessment—a building contractor forgetting to include a continuing project of work, for example—it could point out that something was wrong. The builder might recall that he forgot to enter a previous year's contract, which would affect the circumstances in which payments on account were based. The clause makes an interest charge payable when there has been an understatement. Technically, the taxpayer should have paid more, so the clause brings that about, plainly and simply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In equity, people might think it was worthwhile to under-declare their circumstances if the interest charge were not payable. That is unfair to the legitimate taxpayer who declares his circumstances fully and pays interim payments. I see that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire is receiving advice from outer voices so I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about the difference between accurate and inaccurate in respect of the way in which an omission might be discovered. What is misleading and deliberately misleading is not entirely relevant to our proceedings. I do not mind looking at a problem from a different angle, but I am still right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about circumstances in which assessments are made when a previous event is discovered which alters payment on account. The taxpayer has underpaid in those circumstances, so it is right for interest to be paid. The central issue is that the interest facility should be in place to ensure that we do not encourage people to dodge their dues; otherwise there is no difference in treatment from the taxpayer who makes a correct payment on account. Change to the clause is unnecessary, so I resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The schedule amends various provisions in the Taxes Acts that require a decision or other action to be taken by the Inland Revenue before the making of an assessment. In general, such claims will no longer require the exercise of Revenue discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the amendment, the Chartered Institute of Taxation notes that paragraph 52 removes the direction mechanism in section 122 of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>425</span>
Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.That section directs that a capital distribution in respect of shares should be treated as a part disposal and thus subject to capital gains tax. If the capital distribution is small as compared with the value of the shares—being less than 5 per cent. of the value of the entire holding—the inspector may direct that the distribution not be distributed as a part disposal and instead, be deducted from the base cost of the shares, so increasing the gain on any subsequent disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Revenue accepts that the taxpayer may ask the inspector not to make that direction where it would be beneficial to be taxed on an immediate part disposal, for example, to make use of the annual exemption. A typical case would be the sale of rights nil paid, which is treated as a capital distribution. That is in Inland Revenue Tax Bulletin No. 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 52 removes the direction under section 122(2) of the 1992 Gains Act in line with other self-assessment changes that require formal direction. The intention appears to be that a small capital distribution will automatically be excluded from the part disposal provisions. Is that the case? The institute has therefore asked whether that means that the informal option to be taxed on a partdisposal basis has been withdrawn. Is it intentionally withdrawn, or withdrawn just because of the wording and therefore not intentionally?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 121 would enable a taxpayer to give notice that section 122 of the 1992 Act should not apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to explain the matter to the hon. Gentleman again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a person receives a capital distribution, for example, in respect of shares in a company, that will be a part disposal, which may give rise to a chargeable gain. Under existing legislation, if the inspector is satisfied that the amount of the distribution is small compared with the value of the shares, he may direct that there is no chargeable disposal; rather, the amount of the distribution is deducted from the expenditure allowable on any subsequent disposal of the shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement for the inspector to be satisfied and for a direction to be made causes difficulties under self-assessment procedures. Before a taxpayer could complete his tax return, he would need to know whether the inspector was satisfied that the distribution was small and was prepared to make a direction to that effect. Paragraph 52 of schedule 19 addresses that issue by deleting the requirement for the inspector to be satisfied and for a direction to be made. The effect is that the legislation will operate objectively. If the distribution is small, it does not give rise to a chargeable disposal. If it is not small, it does. Any dispute over whether the distribution is small can be referred to the commissioners on appeal in the usual way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is accepted that the Revenue's interpretation of existing legislation might have involved some blurring at the edges. There was, perhaps, scope for
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
the taxpayer to ask the inspector not to make a direction. However, it seems arguable whether, strictly speaking, that was a correct interpretation of present legislation. The changes proposed in paragraph 52 might not alter the law, but they might remove a concessionary tinge to the operation of existing powers. I do not consider that slight tightening to be unreasonable in the context of the certainty that is desirable under self-assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, were the amendment to be accepted, other provisions which depend on the concept of smallness would need to be addressed. The hon. Gentleman did not touch on other provisions in his remarks although there are 15 other smallness tests in various parts of the tax legislation. Paragraphs 51 and 52 of the schedule amend two such provisions and there are provisions elsewhere which include smallness in an objective way. It would be inequitable if those operated without a provision of the type proposed by the amendment. One advantage of the approach adopted by paragraph 52 is that it will produce a consistent approach to all provisions that depend on the concept of smallness and will remove any variability from existing Revenue practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, given that explanation, the hon. Member for North Warwickshire will be sufficiently satisfied to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 122, in page 295, line 13, leave out paragraph 56.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment. Section 164 of the Gains Act 1992 was inserted by section 48 of the Finance Act 1995 and corrects a defect in reinvestment relief: namely, that more than one gain could be rolled into a qualifying investment even if the aggregate gain exceeded the cost of the qualifying investment and so dropped out of the charge. The section provides that multiple claims in respect of the same investment must be given effect in such order as the reinvestor or, in default, the board, requires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chartered Institute of Taxation noted that the removal of the default alternative will present a practical problem in the case of a taxpayer who does not specify the sequence in a return submitted before 30 September; that is, in order to enable the Revenue to calculate for the self-assessment. To probe the reasoning behind that, we tabled the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last year's Finance Act contained a provision to deal with multiple claims to reinvestment relief to ensure that the relief worked properly. The provision now being amended contains an ordering rule that reliefs are to be treated as claimed in such sequence as the claimant elects or an officer of the board determines in default of an election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Self-assessment procedures make it highly desirable that the involvement of the board be eliminated. Paragraph 56 of schedule 19 will delete
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
the reference to the officer of the board determining the order in the absence of an election. It is assumed, as the hon. Gentleman made clear, that the amendment is a probing one; and I hope that my comments clarify the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ought to point out that where there is more than one claim and those claims are made at different times, there is no difficulty: the effect would be to deal with the claims in the order in which they were made. Where claims are made at the same time, the taxpayer will have the option of specifying an order. It will be clear on the claim form that in the absence of such specification, effect will be given to the claims in the order in which they are set out on the form. A claim form is provided as part of the background notes to the self-assessment tax return. I hope that that information has helped the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another probing amendment. It deals with paragraph 66 which provides that capital gains retirement relief on the grounds of ill health is available where an individual is incapable of doing the kind of work done previously and where that incapacity is likely to be permanent—in other words, when someone has a serious illness that forces him to retire. The relief can provide full exemption for chargeable gains up to £250,000, plus exemption on half of gains between £250,000 and £1 million, to provide for that retirement. Under current law, the individual must produce sufficient evidence of ill health to satisfy the board. Paragraph 66 removes that requirement and replaces it with a power to inquire into a claim after it has been made. It has been argued that the claim requires greater certainty than the proposed, "claim now, check later" system. In the words of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, such cases reinforce the call for an acceptable system of rulings, given the amount of tax in question can be significant. Does the Minister agree with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is another of the rearrangements of procedure that go to the heart of the matter of ensuring that the taxpayer decides what he wants to do about making his self-assessment. Instead of the present situation that requires the taxpayer to check with the tax man whether he is eligible, the proposal works the other way around: when a taxpayer makes an assessment and claims retirement relief on the grounds of ill health, he will be in the driving seat. He will know by what procedures he can determine whether his medical condition is covered by that relief; because it is effectively the same test that is set out on page 16 of the Inland Revenue document business series CGT6, which spells out what a
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>

The general time limit for filing a return is 31 January following the year of assessment for income tax and capital gains tax, the first anniversary of the filing date for taxpayer amendment and the fifth anniversary of the filing date for making assessments. It has been proposed that the time limit of 31 January following the assessment, rather than the first or later anniversary of the following 31 January, should be linked to the filing date as in paragraph I. That would avoid problems where returns are issued late with corresponding delays in filing dates. The amendments seek to link the time limits to the filing dates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Faculty of Taxation notes the lack of justification presented for the reduction in the six-year limit to 22 months under paragraphs 37 and 38. I shall leave it at that rather than go on to deal with the other matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is perhaps instructive to reflect that an individual can deal with these matters whenever he wants to, outside the timetable of the return. That is an important point in determining whether the amendments are relevant. The claim can be made even before the return is issued. Someone with a late issuance of a return need not be troubled by the matters that the hon. Gentleman put before the Committee to justify his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Self-assessment sets out for taxpayers a clear and simple timetable with key dates. For example, 31 January after the year of assessment is the date by which returns that are issued at the normal time should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>429</span>
be filed. It is sensible to have a system that links actions by taxpayers, such as elections, to the normal filing date or anniversaries of that date, thus keeping the self-assessment timetable simple for taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vast majority of returns will have a filing date of 31 January, as they are issued shortly after the end of the tax year. Exceptionally, some returns will be issued after 31 October following the end of a tax year, when the filing date is three months after the return is issued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential point is that at present taxpayers have clear deadlines that do not depend on whether a return is required to be made or on the dates on which such a notice is made. Those deadlines are being extended, but in a way that preserves the present position of not linking the elections to the issue of a return. So it treats taxpayers more generously than at present in terms of the time they have to make this type of claim. They have up to 22 months to amend a claim, so they are allowed a longer period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would add unnecessary complexity to self-assessment. The present time limits cause little problems. Paragraphs 17 and 18 of schedule 20 provide significant relaxations. The key point is not to get caught up on the question of the timetable for the return, but to focus on the fact that the claim that the amendment and the schedule deal with can be made before the return is issued. That means that people can file the claim when it suits them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society suggested this minor amendment, which clarifies matters and should appeal to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield in particular. If we replace
	<br><blockquote><p>"as to the application of '</p></blockquote>
with "concerning", which is more simple and straightforward, we shall have made a reasonable contribution to simplifying matters. Schedule 46B(4) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any question as to the application of any of the following provisions of the principal Act is a question to be determined by the Special Commissioners".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>430</span>
That is wordy and needs simplification. I hope that the Minister will welcome the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was slow to rise because I wanted to give everybody an opportunity to become involved in the issue, but there were clearly no takers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am at a loss about the amendment because there is no significant difference between "as to the application of and "concerning". We used the former wording because it has worked well for many years in the main appeals legislation—section 31(3) of the Taxes Management Act 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule makes only those changes that are necessary to fit with self-assessment. In particular, it retains questions about the application of the provisions that are listed in new section 46B(4) for the special commissioners' sole jurisdiction. No change has, therefore, taken place, and the amendment adds nothing to the appeals provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have married the previous and current systems and tried to retain familiar features wherever possible. The present wording has worked well, and it would cause more confusion to change it now. That would dissipate any gains that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire might anticipate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make no great claims for the amendment—it will not change the world. It simply makes a small gesture towards simplification. The Financial Secretary appears to be saying that reducing a series of words to one word to make a provision easier to understand would add to its complexity because we have never done that before. That does not add up. So much for the Government's proposals to simplify the tax system. It would be easy for the Minister to accept the amendment. It does not change the meaning of the law that he proposes, but merely adds to its simplicity. He should reconsider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of those times when we might say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." The current wording has worked extremely well in the past. If we had had large-scale representations from people who thought that the present system was not working and who wanted changes, we would have considered the matter. The short answer to the hon. Gentleman is that the present wording works extremely well. Changing it would add nothing to the appeals mechanism. The present wording should be retained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment highlights the difficulty with the Bill. Although the Government announced at the end of last year that they were committed to simplifying tax legislation and rewriting it, the Bill is not part of that process. It adds to the existing body of complex legislation. I understand the Minister's argument that the Bill must be consistent with previous legislation in which that phrase was used. Although the word "concerning" would be a simplification, to use it would be inconsistent with that previous complex legislation. We must stick with the existing complexity until we are able to simplify everything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Such an election may be revoked by the taxpayer with the consent of the general commissioners.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals primarily with paragraph 10. The Law Society notes that a taxpayer's election concerning the place where an appeal before the general commissioners is to be heard is irrevocable. It proposes that provision be made for the election to be revoked, subject to the consent of the general commissioners. The amendment provides for such revocation. That may help the Inland Revenue and the taxpayer and if both accept that as convenient, there seems to be no good reason to refuse it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall get a reputation for being hardhearted and unsympathetic if I am not careful. I considered the amendment carefully because in understanding the intention of the proposal, it was clearly important to understand how the appeals mechanism operated in the context of self-assessment. I came to the conclusion that, effectively, there was no need to change the present procedure because of the three choices of where appeals can be heard that are already available to the taxpayer, and the fact that, under the current arrangements, if a taxpayer is in some difficulty, he can ask the Inland Revenue to move the appeal from one location to another. Under normal circumstances, if there is a good reason, that will be done. Part of the point of permission, either by the Inland Revenue or, as the amendment suggests, the general commissioners, is to avoid vexatious switching of appeals between different locations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I considered the amendment carefully to see whether it would add anything to the appeals procedure, but I genuinely could not see that the proposed change would significantly add to the already quite flexible arrangements. Obviously, I will reflect carefully on what the hon. Gentleman has said, but I am not minded to make a change for the reasons that I have given. I cannot see how the amendment would add to what is already a good procedure, which has been adapted for the self-assessment process of appeals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take on board the fact that the Minister says that he will reflect on the matter. It seems sensible that where both parties agree that they should be able to move an appeal—in practice that seems to be the case—the amendment merely creates a statutory basis for that to be done. It is therefore worthwhile. It does not add significantly but creates a

statutory basis for a procedure that everyone agrees would be practical. On the understanding that the Minister has agreed to consider the matters, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 132, in page 324, line 12, leave out "30" and insert "60".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is a very simple one—essentially we are discussing days. We have had representations that the 30-day time limit for submission of an amended return is too short and that 60 days would be more reasonable, particularly for small businesses and companies. The taxpayer might, on receiving the return, want to consult his accountant, who might be on holiday or ill. The document might have to be returned by post. Things can be delayed in the post, and the document might have to be found, sent back, and forwarded again with all the relevant information. In practice, delays happen, and the provision of extra time to allow for those delays, which arise from the way in which people deal with their tax forms, would be a useful amendment to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see that if the type of inquiry that triggers off the time limit in question was under way in the real world, the taxpayer would, as the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister has misunderstood. It was not the taxpayer whom I envisaged slipping off for a holiday—it was his accountant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the taxpayer concerned was employing a competent firm of accountants he would want to make certain, if discussions were taking place with the Inland Revenue about the company's accounting period, that he had his accountant around to deal with the matter. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman should advocate that a shoddy firm of accountants, who would slip away in the middle of detailed inquiries for a quiet holiday in the sun, should be employed. If the person concerned were so minded, how could we be certain that he would be away for only 60 days? It might be longer. That is the "Holiday" programme solution to tax matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised by those who understand these matters that the disputes that we are considering occur
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>433</span>
because a company that wants to obtain some relief tries to make a representation through its assessment as to its trading year, and that the Inland Revenue disputes that. Once the two parties have come to an accommodation as to the facts of the matter, an amended assessment is required. Bearing in mind that the company and, presumably, the accountants, if they had not slipped off for a holiday, would have all the information relating to the original, disputed assessment at their disposal. and would know all the facts, the requirement is that the assessment should be amended. One should concentrate on that word "amended". We are talking not about allowing only 30 days for the production of a brand new return, but about an amendment to be made using information that has already been obtained. Under that view and bearing in mind that the new provision mirrors the existing provisions for inquiries into returns in section 28A, I do not think that there is a need to allow for that extra time. Quite clearly, under current circumstances such matters can already be adequately dealt with in 30 days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a couple of quick questions for the Minister on the clause. The Faculty of Taxation recommends that conditional advance corporation tax claims be permitted with a slightly extended time limit in place of the quantified claim required by schedule I 3A of the Taxes Act 1988. Such flexibility is permitted under schedule 17A for group relief. Perhaps the Financial Secretary can deal with the matter in writing, but it is a legitimate point which he may wish to address in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chartered Institute of Taxation has requested clarification of the significance of paragraph 7(4) and its relationship with paragraph 7(2). Again, the Financial Secretary may wish to write to me about that. The Chartered Institute of Taxation welcomes the provisions in schedule 13A(9) of the Taxes Act 1988, as inserted by paragraph 2, permitting the withdrawal of ACT surrenders. The Faculty of Taxation suggests that the time limit for withdrawing claims should not be less than two years as with group relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chartered Institute of Taxation questioned whether the time limit in paragraph 9(1)(b) on a claim is really necessary and also queried the meaning of the word "assessment" in this context. There are a number
	<span class='label label-info column'>434</span>

	<br><blockquote><p>", to the extent of the excess,".</p></blockquote>
This is an enormously complex matter. Given my reading of it, it will probably take a long time to go through the explanation. Sub-paragraph I provides for the amendment of section 240 of the 1988 Act on the set-off of a company's advanced corporation tax against a subsidiary's liability to corporation tax. Subparagraph 2 defines the amount of ACT which a company may surrender. A claim to surrender more than the amount available is wholly void. The Law Society recommends that the provision in section 240(1B), as inserted by paragraph 1(2), invalidating excessive ACT surrender, should be limited to the excess only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a complex issue and I suspect that the Financial Secretary's answer will be somewhat detailed. This is a probing amendment.

	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While welcoming the proposal as it stands, the Chartered Institute of Taxation says that it has some reservations about drafting and asks what a declaration made by a taxpayer is. Does the mere intention to reinvest give a taxpayer sufficient grounds to make a declaration? If the declaration is to be made in the taxpayer's return, how would it be incorporated? Is a declaration statutory? Does it have to be witnessed, and, if so, by whom? Can those matters be clarified?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the declaration is to be made in the taxpayer's return, it should be possible to make it at any time before the return is finalised. The amendment seeks to extend the period of time available to any time before the return becomes final. There may be a reason for the Government's proposal and we seek some justification for it from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendments Nos. 135 and 136, the Chartered Institute of Taxation raises a number of issues that have been set out in questions regarding rollover relief and sent to members of the Committee. I am sure that the Financial Secretary has had the opportunity of reading that submission. If he is aware of the questions and can deal with them without my rehearsing the various points, I am happy for him to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to convince the hon. Gentleman that the amendments are not necessary. Subsection (3) of new section 153A provides for the declaration to be withdrawn in whole or part at any time. Secondly, the taxpayer will be able to take advantage of the normal rules that provide for a self-assessment return to be amended after the return form has been submitted. That will effectively provide for
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
any change of declaration to be taken into account before the return is finalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to ensure, however, that the declaration is made part of the return on which the self-assessment is based. That will enable the taxpayer to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. What will be required of taxpayers and the facilities available for amending the return will be made clear in the guidance given with the return. A taxpayer may amend his return within 12 months of the filing date of the return unless the inspector has notified his intention to inquire into the return. That means that in non-inquiry cases, a taxpayer may make a declaration at any time in that period if he has not already done so on the return form. Alternatively, he may amend a declaration that he has already made if his reinvestment intentions have changed since the original declaration was made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the officer of the board has notified his intention to inquire into the return, a taxpayer will be able to amend his self-assessment within 30 days of the officer notifying the taxpayer that the inquiry is complete provided that the return was submitted within 12 months of the normal filing date. In doing that, a taxpayer can give effect to any amendments to the return that he has notified to the inspector in the meantime, including any change of intention to reinvest. I hope that that provides a sufficient explanation for the hon. Member for North Warwickshire to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society suggests that new paragraph 5 will lead to an increase in tax that is unjustified and for which no notice is given. I hope that that is not the Government's intention. The amendment puts that point to the Minister to enable him, through the example of Pepper 
	<i>v.</i> Hart. to clarify the ambiguity that seems to be in the clause. Will he state exactly how the provision will work?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I awoke this morning at an early hour thinking of this clause, which has troubled me, too. It took me back to the realms of the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995, with which I was associated. The clause reminds me of certain sections of that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>437</span>
The heart of the clause is the fact that an event that occurs within the period of self-assessment must be dealt with in that particular tax year. In doing that, we are seeking all opportunities not to reopen previous tax years because of consequences in the current tax year. Clause 133 is another of those that removes the need to perform such a reopening process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with cases in which a tenant who already occupies land makes further payments to a landlord for changes to the lease, for surrender of the lease or for commutation of rent. The aim is to ensure that such payments are taken into account for capital gains tax purposes for the year in which they become payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will apply to sums payable on or after 6 April 1996. Although the amount may be payable on or after that date, the amendment would deal with cases in the agreement to vary or surrender the lease made before 6 April 1996. I understand the concerns that tenants and landlords may have because they may have planned the taxation consequences of varying a lease on the basis of the law as it presently stands. However, a number of reasons persuade me not to accept the amendment. It would introduce complexity. Payments received on or after 6 April 1996 which would otherwise feature on the self-assessment tax return for 1996–97 would need to be related back to the earlier year when the lease was granted. For those transitional cases the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue would need to have regard to the date on which the agreement was entered into as well as the date that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>438</span>
amounts payable fell due. For agreements entered into on or after 6 April 1996. the date that the money became payable would be the only relevant date. I do not imagine that the time lag between entering into an agreement and the money becoming payable would be long in most instances. Indeed, in many cases it would be payable on the signing of the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of cases affected is, by definition, likely to be small. They are further reduced by the fact that the details of clause 133 have been available to taxpayers and their advisers since the beginning of January. For agreements made before that time, the money is not payable until April 1996. I hope that the hon. Gentleman now feels able to withdraw his amendment. If further points still require clarification, I shall be happy to deal with them in correspondence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary. Far be it from me to want to introduce complexity into legislative proposals. On the basis of the Minister's argument—and he seems to have dealt also with some points raised by amendment No. 137—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Clause 133 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

	<p>Further consideration adjourned.—[
	<i>Dr. Liam Fox.</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<i>Adjourned accordingly at eighteen minutes to Seven o'clock till Thursday 22 February at half-past Ten o'clock.</i></p>
