	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. Sir Michael said that he would make an announcement about a point of order which I raised with him during this morning's sitting. Do you have anything to say on that, or will you leave it to Sir Michael to resolve later?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considered the point that the hon. Member raised and there is a response to it. As I have just come into the Committee, I shall knit the response together and give it to the hon. Member when he has finished his speech, so that he has an adequate answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have forgotten exactly what I was saying before lunch, but I know that I was referring to remarks
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
made by the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland—the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart)—in reply to the debate. I was saying that he was on to a loser with the Bill in his constituency, because the poorer people who live in Barrhead will not thank him for imposing the poll tax, which will still be in force at the general election. Equally, the people of Eastwood, many of whom are among the wealthiest people in the Glasgow area, will not thank him for increasing their tax bills as a result of the present legislation. It seems that the discounts for single people will be paid for, not by a grant from central Government but by other taxpayers in the same local government area. I imagine that couples form the majority of Eastwood residents—they will not thank the hon. Gentleman for increasing their taxes to pay for other people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for remembering me for so long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before lunch, there was some mumbling on the Labour Front Bench. I understood the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) to say that the idea that annual revaluations were integral to Labour's policy had been made up by Conservative Members. Will the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) confirm that the Labour party's proposal would entail annual revaluations? If it did, that would be bad news for the people of Eastwood, Harrow or anywhere else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference between uprating and revaluation. No one would suggest annual revaluations, because they would not be technically feasible, evenwith the excellent assessor staff we have in Scotland, who apparently make valuations better than any that have been made in England or Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that revaluations will have to continue to take place all the time. That is—or should be—part and parcel of a property tax system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must be clear about the Labour party's policy. I refer to its document entitled "Fair Rates", page 4 of which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we propose to make rolling revaluations each year after the new register is established, perhaps using a system of banding for this purpose."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Banding!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try it again—"banding". We want a rolling revaluation. By that, I do not mean an annual revaluation of every property within a specific local government area, it will be a continuous process of updating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a lottery basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, on an organised basis. However, I accept that the Tory party finds it difficult to believe in anything that might be organised and efficient; that is not the usual way in which the Government operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin M. Brandon-Bravo 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to a rolling revaluation. At what frequency could residents expect a valuer to revalue their properties? Will the valuers inspect properties once a year, once every two years or once every five or 10 years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On an annual basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that sendentary intervention, which confirmed that the revaluation would take place each year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) made specific play—as if the matter were a great mystery—of the discount being somehow chargeable to other residents in an area. Does he agree that the basis of the old rate support grant—the present standing spending assessment arrangements—recognises the profile? Therefore, that element is covered already in a local authority's grant structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not follow the hon. Gentleman's last point. Each year there will be an uprating and we would expect a revaluation of each property within five years, the old rates system which operated under the more efficient local government system in Scotland tended to be carried out in such a way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it might save the Committee a great deal of time and Conservative Members much embarrassment if they bothered to do a little homework and read "Fair Rates"? If my hon. Friend will allow me to make a slightly longer than normal intervention, I shall quote from that document. I am always delighted to read into the record elements of Labour party policy. Page 4 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One of the weaknesses of the old system was that, although the law required a revaluation every five years, revaluations occurred much less frequently than that".</p></blockquote>
Most people know that. The document continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The longer the gap between valuations, the more difficult revaluation became. For this reason, and also to provide a steady and buoyant tax base, we propose to make rolling revaluations each year after the new register is established, perhaps using a system of banding for this purpose. This will help to make the five-year revaluation a less formidable hurdle."</p></blockquote>
There could hardly be a more succinct statement than that. It answered in advance all the questions that have flowed from the mouths of Conservative Members. I hope that my hon. Friend will take pleasure in ramming that passage down their throats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the exception of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, Conservative Members do not seem to know that, under the old rating system in Scotland, the five-year revaluation period was largely maintained. As I said earlier, it was the last bungled revaluation by the Government in 1985 that brought about the poll tax, which we are now abolishing. That is exactly what happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a limit to the number of times that I can give way, but I shall give way to the Under-Secretary because he may know about revaluation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He talked of the previous Tory Government bungling the revaluation. That revaluation was done by the assessors, not central Government. Will the hon. Gentleman withdraw his attack on the professionalism of Scotland's assessors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me explain how the Government bungled the revaluation. The revaluation itself, as the hon. Gentleman said, was carried out by the most expert staff
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
working for local government. No one could doubt their professionalism. The Government did not doubt it. When the Government considered banding in the Bill, Scottish Office Ministers at first wanted to follow the Department of the Environment in using the private sector. However, when they were told that there were experts working in the public sector in Scotland who could do the job more cheaply and more efficiently, they accepted that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government went wrong in the 1985 revaluation because in the year in which they revalued property, they cut rate support grant by about 12·5 per cent. People were faced with both revaluation notices on their property and an enormous increase in their rates bills. If the Government had had the political common sense to maintain or marginally increase rate support grant that year, 90 per cent. of householders in Scotland would have received a rates bill similar to that which they had received the year before. That is usually the. impact of a genuine revaluation. Revaluations uprate properties in relation to other properties. Unless something has happened in an area or within a particular house, revaluation does not affect comparative rateable values.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert Key)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman knows me well enough after all these years to know that I would not try to catch him out with a silly or cheap point. My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) raised the matter of uprating and commented on the statement by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) that when Conservative Members referred to Labour's policy leading to revaluations every year we were making it up. Will the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) tell us the difference between uprating and revaluation? It is clear from page 4 of "Fair Rates", as the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said, that Labour proposes to make rolling revaluations each year. What is the difference between that and uprating?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the hon. Gentleman intends to uprate the bands in the Bill regularly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Nicholas Bennett)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. That is what is so silly about the measure. It is incredible. I thought that it was foolish legislation, but it is clear that it is even worse than I thought. Will there never be any uprating? Are the bands to remain static in legislation for ever? We are debating the Government's Bill. They are trying to put their proposals on the statute book. When we put measures on the statute book next year, Conservative Members, in opposition, will be able to ask the same questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has not the Audit Commission advised the Government that under the Bill there will have to be periodic revaluations because property values do not change uniformly across the country? If the Bill is to work, the Government will have to introduce a revaluation system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. The other point to make on that subject is that, as I am reliably informed, when a property is sold it might move up a band. If there is no uprating for several years it might even move up three or four bands in one jump. Selling one's property if it had become more valuable and would incur a much higher level of rates or council tax would be difficult.

	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to return to the points raised by the Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities. He made considerable play of the differences between our proposals for England and Wales and our proposals for Scotland. His whole speech focused on trying to find differences between the two. Let me give him a simple answer. The differences between the two relate to the technical differences between property taxes in England and Scotland. If the Minister does not believe that there are differences between the two, I suggest that he reads clause 1 and then clause 70. He said that they achieve the same thing; but they are worded differently, and they contain different proposals and different ideas because there is a clear difference between the local government structures in England and Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept clauses 2 and 71 are almost identical, but clauses 3 and 72, clauses 4 and 73 and, finally, the clause on banding, are all different from each other. That is because there are clear differences between the way in which houses are valued in Scotland and in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland, there have always been regular upratings and revaluations of property because there is an expertise in Scottish local government that is lacking in England and Wales. The differences between the proposals for Scotland and the proposals for England and Wales are the same sort of technical differences that one would expect to find between the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities on different parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister, who, as I said earlier, made a weak speech of which he obviously did not believe a word, will not try to hinge the whole debate on the clauses relating to Scotland on the differences between Labour Members. The same sort of differences arise between himself and Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In ideological terms, the differences between the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and the unfortunately absent, Secretary of State for the Environment are profound. In his speech, the hon. Member did not once offer any explanation—particularly to the Scottish people—of why he abandoned his support for the poll tax when the Secretary of State for the Environment told him to. Has he abandoned the basic principles upon which he believed that the poll tax should be maintained? He stoutly defended it right up until only days before the announcement about the council tax and the abandonment of the poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Janman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Thurrock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is about to intervene. He is a Back Bencher, so he is still allowed to support the poll tax. But the Minister is now about to tell us why he abandoned the poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not focusing the whole of my speech on this point, but it is a simple one. Why are the Opposition, in discussing the amendments, using the term "fair rates in Scotland", but using no such term for England and Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The documentation upon which the amendments for England and Wales are centred is called "Fair Rates". The Minister is struggling in the extreme if this is the level of debate we must indulge in to get a simple message across.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hon. Gentleman well qualified, although he is mistaken about my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, to recognise abandonment of principle when he sees it? Abandonment of principle entirely sums up the Labour party's policies on defence, on Europe and on many other issues such as renationalisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be pushing your indulgence hard, Mr. Leadbitter, if I started down that road. But we are talking about the Minister here. He stood so firm on the poll tax: he voted for it and held it up for the Scottish people to see and admire. He got it drastically wrong but he has never once been able to say, "I was wrong and I made a mistake and we now have to put that mistake right." It is through his efforts and those of his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland and of the Minister of State that we now have a tax that is almost as bad as the poll tax itself. It is they who insist on retaining some poll tax elements, instead of simply saying, "We were wrong. We are abandoning the poll tax and returning to a sensible, property tax system."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a sensible, property tax system, by the way, that almost every country in the western world uses as a form of local taxation. Before the Liberal Democrats jump up and down, I accept that some countries use it in conjunction with local income tax. But they will not admit that same fact either; when they propound local income tax they are never perpared to say that it is often used in conjunction with property taxes. Large numbers of countries believe that property should be taxed. I see no reason why we should differ from them. Our amendment represents a sensible way forward and a means of ensuring that we have, in April 1993, a system of local taxation in Scotland and in England and Wales that will last for a considerable time—not one that will have to be abandoned very soon by any Government who introduced it or were forced to accept it. It is an administrative nightmare which cannot last.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) raised the issue this morning, and again before resuming his speech this afternoon, of his amendment No. 13. The Chairman this morning pursued the matter and the answer was available for me when I came into the Committee Room. I felt the need to delay mentioning it just in case there was a possibility of finding a loophole somewhere, such as that clause 70 appeared quite distant or that English and Scottish questions might be separated. I find that in both cases I cannot be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When an amendment is grouped with other amendments, it can be moved formally in the normal way. On the other hand, the guillotine comes down with a short sharp chop at 10 pm tomorrow night. If the hon. Member for Cathcart wishes to move the amendment formally before 10 pm, then it can be dealt with; otherwise, the order of the House is quite clear, and quite cruel—but helpful to the Chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I am grateful to you for that information. However, it raises considerable difficulties and makes the task of Scottish Members on this Committee even more impossible. Every group will be like this. The five or six English clauses will be taken first. The Scottish clauses, the stand part, and any amendments that we have raised during the other debates will follow. They will thus always be squeezed to the end of the guillotine, if they are reached at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
This is an absolute disgrace. Would it be possible, in view of what you have just said, Mr. Leadbitter, to take the equivalent clauses side by side, so that we take clause 1, then clause 70, clause 2, then clause 71, and so on? In that way we would at least debate the issues. I do not blame you or Sir Michael for this, because you are bound to a timetable motion laid down to the Government But for the Government to railroad the Bill through Parliament, against the wishes of the Scottish people, so that members of the Committee cannot properly debate the issues or even vote on the amendments affecting Scotland is an insult to Scottish Members of Parliament and the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Scottish Tory party had an ounce of common sense, it would demand that this be changed. The Tory party is already in dire straits in Scotland as a result of its actions, but by golly, when the Scottish people become aware of what is happening, they will turn against the Tories even more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a point about which I have tried to be helpful. But I think that he recognises, quite reasonably, that we are subject to the order of the House and not in a position to amend it. The guillotine, under any circumstance of debate, takes place at a precise time—there is unfortunately no leeway. The Chair can only suggest that members of the Committee do their best in the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I accept the point about the guillotine having to be imposed at the given time, but I am still not clear why it is not possible to link the Scottish clauses which come late in the Bill with the English clauses, so that there is at least consideration of the same issues as we go through the Bill and we can draw together the issues for the United Kingdom in one debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could you possibly discuss that further, Mr. Leadbitter, and come back to us with a decision?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) is absolutely right. First, the Scots put up with a poll tax, devised particularly for us against our will, under enforced legislation that we opposed. Then we have this performance so that, through no fault of yours, Mr. Leadbitter, legislation is forced upon us which might not even be discussed in any detail. I suspect that the people of Scotland will react very angrily to this, considering that this Parliament is supposed to be a United Kingdom Parliament, as Conservative Members never tire of telling us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order Mr. Leadbitter. I have great sympathy for the points made by my Scottish colleagues. I understand that you are operating entirely under the terms of the guillotine motion, Mr. Leadbitter, unsatisfactory though that is. We have no option but to allow the guillotine to fall at the given point and for the business then being debated to be completed. But surely the guillotine motion—which rearranges the order in which the clauses would normally be dealt with—suggests a rationale which would allow the clauses to be dealt with in parallel. In that way, in debates on English and Welsh clauses we could also deal with the appropriate Scottish clause and the amendments thereto, even if there was not a Division until the guillotine fell in the ordinary
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
way. if that is not done, my hon. Friends are right that debate on the Scottish provisions will be very much inhibited, if not made virtually impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter for the Government rather than for you, Mr. Leadbitter, but I cannot believe that they wish the Scottish people to have the message yet again that the Government are so cavalier in their treatment of Scotland that they do not care whether any adequate debate takes place on these measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I reinforce the request that you have a further look at this matter at your earliest convenience, Mr. Leadbitter, because I cannot believe that this is the right way for the Committee to proceed? I cannot even believe that it is the Government's intention. They may be incompetent, but surely they are not as malevolent as this. They cannot intend the debate on the Scottish provisions to be so badly affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I have rarely heard so much bunk. The pace at which the amendments are taken and any votes which may be taken on them are in the hands of Opposition Members. The Opposition can arrange their affairs perfectly adequately to debate those issues or not, depending upon the speed with which they take all the amendments in the groups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty is that one cannot get more than a pint out of a pint pot. The Committee has a specific time scale and however the Committee attempts to rearrange clauses or amendments, debating time remains limited. When an amendment within a group deals with Scottish matters, such as amendment No. 13, hon. Members could debate it separately. It could also be removed from the group. Unfortunately, that does not alter the time scale. If the Committee believes, from its experience, that the guillotine motion, which is the order of the House, does not facilitate full consideration of the Bill, it can be altered only by a substantive motion before the House. The Chair must not use terms that appear, even marginally, to favour a specific point of view. However, the Chair has a stake in the co-operation of the Committee. If members feel strongly, the Committee must move a substantive motion before the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee knows about the wider time scale, and the Government's requirement to proceed with the Bill promptly. That is merely an observation; it is not for members of the Committee to agree or disagree with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. Thank you for your consideration of the point and your guidance. My hon. Friends and I will consider the advice and decide what action to take. It is refreshing and welcome that you are prepared to discuss the important issue constructively, Mr. Leadbitter. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment simply dismissed the matter. It is not surprising that few Conservative voices are raised; not a single Scottish Back-Bench Member is a member of the Committee. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the only Scottish representative, has remained silent about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

of State for Scotland expressed himself unfortunately about the guillotine motion. Did the hon. Gentleman vote on it in the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to clear up the endpiece of the point of order. I said earlier to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) that amendment No. 13 was placed in a specific group for understandable reasons. A difficulty has arisen: the amendment cannot be moved formally until we discuss clause 70. The hon. Gentleman must ensure that he acts before 10 o'clock tomorrow night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. There are Scottish amendments among those that relate to the next four clauses. We might experience difficulties in voting on any of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: After that little excursion, I welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Leadbitter. We are delighted that you are to be a colleague of Sir Michael Shaw on this Committee. As a Committee we are in a difficult situation and we look to you, Mr. Leadbitter, to offer us the guidance and good humour which we know that you will provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had an unsatisfactory debate in that the Minister's reply was plainly inadequate, for reasons that I shall explain. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) pointed to what he described as technical differences between the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and his other Front Bench colleagues, but I thought that the political differences that emerged were more interesting. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland was more up-front in his support, which he hardly bothered to conceal, for the principle of the poll tax. Indeed, he volunteered the point that the new tax was a combination of a property tax and a personal tax and put forward a case for it on the ground that it might secure rough-and-ready justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that many of the Minister's compatriots and taxpayers in other parts of the country will not be all that encouraged by that commendation and will remember the similar remarks made by the hon. Gentleman in favour of the poll tax. Rough-and-ready justice is not good enough. No doubt that is what the Minister and his ministerial colleagues thought they could get away with when they introduced the poll tax, but we and he should now know better than that. Rough-and-ready justice is not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting to hear what the Minister had to say about the discount. He said quite flatly—I do not know whether he had consulted his ministerial colleagues—that the discount had nothing whatever to do with the ability to pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> 
	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman confirms it. On that, at least, he is right. I hope that he will persuade his ministerial colleagues to be as frank and honest with the Committee and with the public as he has been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that, irrespective of their means, single people need protection on this score. That was an interesting element in the Government's thinking. It points to the difference between the Oppositions' view—we think that the ability to pay matters—and the Government's view, which is to secure a political advantage and to protect some of their better-off friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth bearing in mind that it will cost local government about £800 million to provide the discounts,
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
according to a statement made today that my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) had told me about. That money will come from the pockets of those who have to pay the bills without the benefit of the discount. It is yet another burden piled on them. That is another reason why the average bill for the average council tax payer will be so much higher than it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting point in the Minister's reply—if we can dignify it with that title—was that having conceded that the council tax was partly a property tax and and partly a personal tax, he then jibbed at my attempt to elucidate the difference between the property tax element and what he had previously excoriated—and still does—as a roof tax. As he could not answer the question then—he slid off it rapidly—can he answer the question now? As, on his own admission, his own tax is partly a property tax, how does that element of property tax differ from a roof tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to criticise me for being clear in what I said, which is an unusual criticism to throw at a Minister. The difference between a roof tax and a council tax is that the council tax is, in effect, 50 per cent. a personal tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is patent to the Committee that the Minister has again avoided my question. He concedes that the council tax is part property tax and part personal tax. Let us set aside whether the personal tax is 50 per cent., 25 per cent. or zero per cent. and concentrate on the very substantial element—it is a minimum of 50 per cent.—that the Minister describes as a property tax. Why should not the people of Scotland describe that element as a roof tax? Why is it not accurate to describe the council tax as part roof tax and part head tax? Again, I invite the Minister to explain that conundrum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is going around in circles. The council tax is 50 per cent. a property tax and 50 per cent. a personal tax. I have never argued against a local tax that included a property element.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is plain that we cannot persuade the Minister to answer the question, but since he now says that he has always regarded an element of property tax as perfectly acceptable, will he accept also that that is precisely the element that he has lambasted as a roof tax in the past?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seem to have to say the same thing again and again to the hon. Gentleman. I opposed a straightforward roof tax which was 100 per cent. a property tax. I am saying now that there is, in effect, a sensible compromise. We have a tax which is 50 per cent, a property tax and 50 per cent, a personal tax. I have said that about five times, and hope that the hon. Gentleman can now accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the Minister by rephrasing the question. Will he accept that what he now supports includes an element of property tax or roof tax? It is important that we get to the bottom of this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. The Opposition said earlier that they are anxious that there may not be time during our proceedings to discuss in proper detail the clauses that relate to Scotland. Is it in order that they now waste the Committee's time by attempting to debate academic minutiae and so are eating into that time, which we could use to discuss properly how the Bill affects the whole of the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, that is not a point of order. We must all decide what wastes the Committee's time. That has been a puzzle to me for about 28 years; I have never discovered what constitutes wasting a Committee's time. The time belongs to the Committee, whose members must use it as best they can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Leadbitter. I congratulate the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman) on a valiant attempt to rescue the Minister, who is intent on not answering the question. Anybody who has listened to this exchange will conclude that the Minister is so keen not to be drawn on the matter because he knows that, logically, the element of property tax in the tax that he now supports is indistinguishable from a roof tax. Therefore, what he describes as a combination of a property tax and a personal tax is described equally well as a combination of a roof tax and a head tax. I shall leave that point now as we have clearly established the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's reply was disappointing because he did not deal with the question that the amendments pose. It seems that the Minister was so bemused by the language of the amendments that he failed to understand that our aim was to tease out from him the reason for the new proposals referring not to property in the terms described under the rates legislation, but to dwellings. I think that 
	<i>Hansard</i> will bear me out when I say that the Minister did not offer one word about that. When I moved the amendment, I asked why there had been a shift from a property-based tax, in the sense that the rates were property based, to a tax on dwellings. The Minister not only failed to answer that, he did not even attempt to answer or bother to recognise the point. Now that he is well aware of the amendment's purpose, will he offer an answer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had given the answer to the hon. Gentleman, but, if he wishes, I can answer again. Technically, "dwelling" is defined clearly in the Bill by reference to valuation law and accords very closely, as far as Scotland is concerned, with the concept of domestic subjects. I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman the technical explanation that he is looking for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that, yet again, the Minister has disappointed us because he has given us a bit of briefing, no doubt obtained in a hurry from his civil servants, not an answer to the question, which is, "Why has the change been made across the board, not just in Scotland but in England and Wales?" Why are we no longer talking about a property-based tax? Why are we now taxing dwellings? I invite the Minister to explain that difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain to the hon. Gentleman yet again. The tax is levied in respect of domestic property only, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees with that. It is not levied on a wider definition of property as contained in the hon. Gentleman's amendment. That is why I tried to establish that there was a difference between what the hon. Gentleman said and what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said during the debate on amendment No. 13. I have now established that. The tax is levied in respect of property—domestic property only. Domestic property is described in the Bill by the term "dwelling".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Committee has been bothered by the point because the Minister cannot deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is relevant. The legislation contains a substantial change. The Minister and his colleagues have purported to bring back a property tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities (Mr. Michael Portillo)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is saying that it is not the rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. The Minister at least has grasped the point. His ministerial colleague from the Scottish Office has read out a brief which, in effect, concedes that point. However, we have, from the outset of the debate, made it clear that we want to know why the change was made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The change from domestic property as defined under the rates to domestic dwellings as defined under the legislation. It is a legitimate question and it reveals that Ministers are unable to answer questions' about the thinking that underlies the Government's legislation. We have four Ministers in Committee. I widen my request. I invite any Minister to tell us why the change was made. Why was the definition of property that applied under the rates changed to a new definition of dwelling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because it is a new tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Under-Secretary says that it is because it is a new tax. I agree that novelty has some attractions and advantages, but why was the legislation framed in those terms? Surely Ministers can explain why "dwelling" appears in the Government's legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the hon. Gentleman's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the Government's legislation. Why is the word there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may agree with me that the simple explanation is that the Government hate anything that might make the Bill look like the rates, therefore they have to change names simply for the sake of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may be on to the point. Perhaps that explains why none of the luminaries on the Government Front Bench is prepared to get to his feet to offer an explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have demonstrated that Ministers are unwilling to defend the provision, even if they understand it. For that reason, we have had a most unsatisfactory debate and we may wish to return to the point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 1, line 13, at end insert—

	<div class='ul'>

	<li>'(1A) The duty specified in subsection (1) above shall be applicable from the date therein referred to, whether or not preparations for the introduction of discounts in accordance with section 11 and Schedule 1 below have been completed by such date as the Secretary of State may specify which shall be not later than three months before the date specified in subsection (1).</li>

	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
concerning eligibility for income support up to 100 per cent, of the amount of any council tax liability shall have effect from the date specified in subsection (1) above.'.</li></div> <!-- ul -->
The amendment arises from the Bill's brave and optimistic assertion that the council tax should be introduced at the beginning of the financial year 1993. We support that timing and anything to get rid of the poll tax by that date, but we are less optimistic than the Government in believing that that timetable can be met. We are alarmed that the Bill contains no safety net, no fallback and no recognition of even a scintilla of a possibility that the timetable will not be met. The Committee should discuss that and the amendment invites us to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no provision in the Bill for the possibility— some would say probability—that the timetable will not be met. It is fair to say—the right hon. Gentleman is not here to gainsay it—that such matters are not of great concern to the Secretary of State. It is clear that he does not care whether the measure will be implemented by a specific date, as long as it tides the Conservative party over the difficulty of the general election. That is all he is interested in. He does not care whether there are administrative problems or whether the Bill is implemented in 1993 or 1994; he is concerned solely with putting his party in the least unfavourable position possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Poll position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman would like to be in poll position, if not poll tax position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are concerned about good government—the administration of local government and the services that it delivers. We are worried at the prospect of the proposed date not being met and about the consequence that the poll tax may live on during 1992–93 and 1993–94.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take that gloomy and pessimistic view because it is clear that local government is struggling with problems in trying to implement the new tax. The first problem is the difficulty of administering and collecting the poll tax during its dying days, however long they may last. On Second Reading I quoted with approval an article written by Mr. Ron Lord, assistant chief financial officer of Wakefield council, which was published in 
	<i>Municipal Journal.</i> He said that with the poll tax local government at least had the advantage of being able to grapple with the problems of the new tax while being able to put on automatic pilot the rates system which it knew would work and would not require great effort to administer. As Mr. Lord said, that advantage has now gone. Local authorities must grapple with the difficult problems of administering the poll tax at the same time as having to split its attention, energy and effort to deal with a totally new tax at the same time. Let us not underestimate the problems of collecting the poll tax, which are intrinsic to that tax and which are about to engulf the whole of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before Conservative Members rise to try to pin blame on individual authorities, let them reflect on the fact that by the end of this year no fewer than 7·5 million summonses will have been issued by local government in respect of the poll tax. Arrears and other uncollected poll tax will amount to £1·5 billion. The sums, problems and numbers are huge, and it is no wonder that the courts and the police complain that they cannot handle them. The police are saying that they will walk away from the problems because they do not want to be involved. Such problems have arisen from the intrinsic difficulties of collecting the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
At the same time as local government's administration and budgeting has been totally disrupted by the chaos, they are having to delay setting the budgets for the coming financial year because they still do not know what standard spending assessment the Government will set, nor what capping criteria will be applied. Thus the Government who purport to be concerned about delays are in fact holding back critical information required by local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed tax is both new and complicated. It comprises many elements, none of which has been tried in practice. It is being introduced through a Bill which everyone with half an eye can see is being rushed through the House and the Committee. It was rushed through on a guillotine motion introduced straight after Second Reading. Moreover it is being rushed through with only a fraction of the time—itself inadequate—spent over the poll tax. It is proceeding so quickly that no mistakes can be afforded.

I refer to the article by Mr. Ron Lord, who made it clear that this time around there was no time for mistakes, second thoughts or second chances. Yet we are being asked to believe that the timetable for implementing the council tax by 1993 can proceed because the legislation will be perfect—that after all the catastrophes and disasters that the Government are responsible for inflicting on local government finance, miraculously they have somehow got it right on this one occasion. Frankly, that beggars belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least the poll tax had the initial virtue of simplicity; but the council tax is quite self-consciously complicated. As we have heard from the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Eastwood, the council tax is a combination of a property and a personal tax. As a property tax, it is totally new. The discount system has not been tried in the past. The basis of valuation for the property tax is also new, at least for most parts of the country. The tax also turns on a proposal for banding which has also not yet been tried. Whilst the introduction of 100 per cent, rebates is welcome, it remains a new rebate scheme. The tax further depends on new transitional arrangements, which we have yet to hear about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a consequence of all those changes, new software will also be important. To administer the council tax, every local authority will have to commission, buy and learn to use completely new software. No wonder that software companies have added their voices to those who believe that the whole measure is vastly under-prepared and based on a time scale that cannot possibly be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all these reasons—and yet another is the need to introduce new staff and personnel to deal with the untried scheme—local authorities and many others are extremely sceptical about the possibility of operating the new tax by 1 April 1993. Virtually all the independent bodies that have looked into the problem are agreed that the timetable is hopelessly optimistic—the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy; the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation; even the Audit Commission. Indeed, in its customary tactful way—without saying straight out that it is impossible—the Audit Commission has done its damndest to show how seriously it regards some of the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Audit Commission has said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is clear that there are powerful financial arguments for introducing the council tax in 1993. But this timetable is far tighter than for the community charge. There were over four
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
years between the publication of the Green Paper 'Paying for Local Government' in January 1986 and the introduction of the community charge in April 1990."</p></blockquote>
This refers, of course, to England and Wales.
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will be only two years between the publication of the consultation paper 'A New Tax for Local Government' and the proposed introduction of the council tax … The council tax timetable could be achieved but only if a strict implementation timetable is set and adhered to. If the vital milestones are not reached on time, introduction should be deferred."</p></blockquote>
The Audit Commission is there giving the plainest possible warning that the Government are walking a tightrope from which they are all too likely to fall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authority treasurers are also worried. The treasurer of Plymouth district council was one of the few people to go public about the great anxiety among professionals about the administrative burden that they are expected to undertake. Everyone who knows about local government is aware of that anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all these reasons it is clear that there is at least a possibility—most would say a probability—that the 1 April 1993 deadline will not be met. However, the Bill makes no provision for that eventuality. We believe that that eventuality must be avoided at all costs. We do not want to see the poll tax living on for a further year. That is why our amendment suggests that one of the more complicated aspects of the new tax should be separated off and abandoned, at least for the time being. If we could abandon discount arrangements, which have brought tremendous complexity, we might have a better chance of meeting the Government's deadline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Audit Commission said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is difficult to estimate the administrative workload involved in discounts."</p></blockquote>
It went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"33 per cent, of households are single people",</p></blockquote>
which covers about 7 million households. It does not mention that in London, the figure is 40 per cent., and in some inner London boroughs it is probably greater than 50 per cent. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there may be a large amount of movement between one and two adult households."</p></blockquote>
The Government seem to have considered none of those points. However, the council tax's start date of 1 April 1993 is prejudiced if one of the tax's prerequisites is that discounts must be in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman actually saying that his party's policy is to introduce the council tax without discounts, so that every pensioner and each one-parent household will have to pay the full council tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had thought that the hon. Gentleman was too old a hand to make such a pathetically naive point. The Opposition are trying in this Committee to rescue a piece of Government legislation which is profoundly unsatisfactory and rapidly heading for the rocks. We are inviting Ministers to consider one of the obvious problems from which they have averted their gaze.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps our debate on the amendment will persuade the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis)—if previous experience is anything to go by, we are unlikely to persuade his ministerial colleagues—to address the problem about what should be done if administrative
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
difficulties, such as those that I have described, make it impossible to hit the 1 April 1993 deadline. We are entitled to hear an answer to that problem, and we may be able to get an answer, at least from the hon. Gentleman. Discount complexity should be dropped, if necessary, to make sure that the poll tax has gone by 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment would also ensure that if this course were pursued by the Government, the corresponding commitment to introduce 100 per cent, rebates would be retained. We want the abolition of the 20 per cent, contribution rule to be brought in as quickly as possible—even before 1 April 1993. Given the current state of revisionism among Conservative Members, I doubt whether anyone could be found to defend the 20 per cent, contribution rule. After all, it was the one part of the poll tax disaster that Conservative Members clung to until the last moment. They said that at least a virtue of the poll tax was that everyone must make some contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am giving Conservative Members a chance—I suspect none will accept it—to say that the 20 per cent, contribution rule is a jolly good thing and ought to be retained. If they do, I assume that in the fullness of time they will feel obliged to vote against the provision that would do away with it. Not a muscle twitches or voice is raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We assume, therefore, that no one supports the 20 per cent, contribution rule. The only question is, why is it being reprieved until 1 April 1993? When Ministers are asked that question, they give a lame answer: "We cannot change the rules on contributions under the poll tax because the social security or income support rules provide in some respect for that contribution to be paid." That may or may not be an answer for the current financial year but surely it cannot be the answer for the forthcoming financial year. If Tory Ministers are itching to get rid of the contribution rule because the scales have fallen from their eyes and they have realised what damage it has done, what a pity they cannot do so because of the wicked rules on income support. Who could change the income support rules for the next financial year? The self-same people. So their explanation lacks conviction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Social Security Select Committee, of which I am a member, interviewed the Secretary of State for Social Security last week. We questioned the system whereby his Department apparently makes major changes only twice a year and asked whether this was done to fit in with software technology. He said that it was not, and that if the Government decided to make changes to benefit during the year, the Department had the capability to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has illustrated that there is no technical problem. The changes could be made and the 20 per cent, contribution rule ended on 1 April 1992 or another, earlier, appropriate date. Instead, the Government are forcing us to wait until April 1993. What is clearly missing from the equation is the political will, which explains why the change is not being made sooner. Why is that will missing, when the Bill provides for the change to take place in April 1993? The reason is the familiar confusion underlying the Bill, and Ministers' fear that if they dismantle the poll tax and all its doings too rapidly, they will alienate some of their diehard supporters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If that chore was taken away from town hall staff, they could be better employed turning their attention to these legislative proposals. Should not the Government consider that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Right again. Opposition Members are well prepared, by comparison with Conservative members of the Committee, so my hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, value for money is the catchphrase, as my hon. Friend says.

	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not also true that, with straightforward tax collection, the Treasury is well prepared to write off collection if the amount collected is less than the cost of collecting it?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right again. What is happening is a complete denial of rationality and common sense and, presumably, proper accounting practice. But none of that seems to weigh with the Conservatives. I notice that suddenly virtually every Tory member of the Committee is studiously studying his papers, unwilling to comment on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are left with a puzzle. Why is this necessary, desirable, overdue and urgently required change, one that is demanded by common sense and common justice, and which will be made on 1 April 1993, being delayed? We shall listen with interest to what Ministers say about that. No doubt they have an answer somewhere, although the performance of some of their ministerial colleagues does not make us too optimistic on that score.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may introduce what might be a mildly more sinister note. When the matter has been raised with Scottish Office Ministers, the explanation has been that the social security payments were uprated to take account of the 20 per cent, of the poll tax bill, that to change them next year for the poll tax would create great problems for the Department of Social Security, and that it would be much better to do it the following year. The implication of that is that when 100 per cent, rebates are eventually introduced the Government will cut benefits by a corresponding amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that that may well be so. We look forward to hearing what Ministers will say about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just in case anyone assumes that these anxieties are of importance only to the Labour party, perhaps I may read a short list—I am sure that it could be longer—of the leading bodies that have urged the Government to do away with the 20 per cent, contribution; it contains the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy; the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities; the Association of Metropolitan Authorities; the Association
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
of District Councils, under Tory control; the Association of London Authorities; the London Boroughs Association, under Tory control; the Child Poverty Action Group; and, finally, the Audit Commisson, which provided so much of the argument which underlies this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet still, as I understand it—we might hear it confirmed a little later—the Government propose not to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend invite the Minister to say whether anybody has argued in favour of keeping the 20 per cent.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting question. I assume that someone must be arguing for it; deep in the interstices of the Department of the Environment someone must be saying, "On no account must we move on this question." Either someone has sufficient political clout, or someone is advancing arguments of such persuasiveness that we can only guess at it; in any event, someone must be doing a very good job of propping up the indefensible. If there are such persuasive arguments, it would help the Committee and the British people to know what they are. Whoever replies to this debate might undertake that task— 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> A relieved expression passes across the face of the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. I suspect that the hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key)—the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment—might undertake that task. We look forward to his explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to make the argument as fairly as I can. Three points have arisen. First, what is the Government's assessment of the likelihood of delay in implementing the council tax? When offering that assessment, I hope that we shall not hear all the familiar bluster about how confident they are; let us have a sensible discussion, for a change, about what precisely the administrative problems are, how the Government assess them, and what the chances are of actually meeting the date. It would be very refreshing to receive a sensible comment on such a major issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if it is recognised, and surely it must be, that there is at least a chance—however the Government may quantify that chance—that 1 April 1993 might not be met, what contingency arrangements have the Government made? There are none in the Bill. Surely it has crossed the Government's minds that this problem might arise? Have the Government so much given up the prospect of winning a general election that they have not thought about the problems of what will happen after a general election? We need to hear that answer from the lips of the Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, why, oh why, is the 20 per cent, contribution rule not to be abolished at the earliest possible opportunity? Why is it kept in being until 1 April 1993?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The debate has been interesting. If the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) had been here, she could have helped us with those questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the advantages of sitting on the Back Benches is that I can serve on a range of Standing Committees discussing different topics. In recent years, I have regularly served on Committees dealing with local government and almost simultaneously been involved with Committees sititng further down the corridor dealing with social security. Quite regularly, the information given to one Committee has conflicted with, if not contradicted, the information given to another Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
I shall give a practical example. Promises were given during the Committee stage of the 1989 Local Government and Housing Bill when rents were "freed", that the people who would have to pay extra rent would have that rent met from housing benefit. However, further along the corridor, the Committee dealing with social services was curtailing the housing benefit to be paid to people whose rents went up!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this Committee achieves a first. If we refer to the schedule of repeal of Acts that the Bill will affect, we find that we go back as far as the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1963. As we work through, we find that all the local government legislation in which I have been involved since 1987 is altered and there is another interesting diversion. We read that we shall be altering chapters of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and the Social Security Administration Act 1992. I find that surprising. I am beginning to understand retrospective legislation, but I do not understand futuristic legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can we amend legislation that has not been enacted? The reason is that the Government have not sorted out the relationship between the discounts and benefits system in the Bill and what will need to be changed later in social security legislation. Note the date. It will be some years after the House has worked through the local government legislation before it will even begin to look at the implications for social security. That puts into the distant future the date by which people will get their benefit reductions, and increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I press the Government to tell us now why no information about discounts is included in the Bill to enable the figures to be worked out. The measure will require new administration and more bureaucracy, but no one has yet told us what the implications are. The only part of the Government's proposals that has met universal acclaim and been welcomed is the 100 per cent, rebate for the council tax. We were told last time that there would be no transitional arrangements and then there were transitional arrangements to the original transitional arrangements because the former Prime Minister was stopped by a pensioner who pointed out that he was not receiving even the 80 per cent, back on the poll tax that he was promised. Other transitional arrangements were made to deal with the £140 which, in many cases, never materialised for people on income support or people receiving pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are we left with now? The fact that the Government are saying that there will be a 100 per cent, rebate does not square with the social security system that should be delivering it. It is incumbent on the Minister to say that he has already received from the Secretary of State for Social Security, and from the Treasury, assurances that those rebates will be met in full; otherwise, as with the implications of local government legislation that we have seen so far—for rent, systems and so on—we shall be 5 per cent., 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, short in each case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recommend that the hon. Gentleman opens the Bill at page 163 and reads what it states under the heading of the Social Security Administration Act 1992.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Find out what a consolidation measure is!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman listens to me instead of shouting remarks from a sedentary position in his usual ignorant fashion, he might accept that those details refer directly to the benefits that will be paid in respect of personal community charges. Opposition Members must know whether the rebates will be paid in full. Some of us have been Members of Parliament long enough to know about the implications of consolidation measures. I remember that full rebates were promised under the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, yet people received only 85 per cent, rebates. That is the reality. Unless guarantees are given now that people will receive full rebates, the reality is that they will not. After the debate on the Bill has left the headlines and the House, people will want to know why the Government promised them something before an election that was not later delivered. Regrettably, that has become the usual story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A moment ago, the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) said glibly that there was a reference in the White Paper to income support. That reference actually states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government will therefore need to consider at the relevant time an adjustment to benefit rates on the introduction of the new tax."</p></blockquote>
That statement rings like the echo of a promise made in the Conservative party manifesto about the child benefit system when it would be, as it were, "held as now". At that time, we did not realise that child benefit would be frozen for three years. It was not even increased to the full extent in the recent adjustments. In other words, the White Paper contains a paper promise that benefits might be increased. However, as we know from social security legislation, benefits might even be reduced. The White Paper also suggests that people should pay at least 5 per cent, of the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that, at long last, the Government have accepted the principle of means testing and a person's right to a full rebate on the basis of proof of lack of income rather than insisting, as some Ministers have done and as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
some recidivists do now, that everyone must pay something even though he or she is not in receipt of any income. At least that latter principle has been breached, and I hope that we shall not return to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The articles written by the Prime Minister about how difficult it was to survive on social security benefit while unemployed might put an end to those stories of scroungers that surrounded the Bill and the White Paper when the poll tax was introduced. Let us hope that the notion that everybody should be forced to pay something so that people realise that they have to suffer some pain to contribute to local services has gone and that Conservative Members accept 100 per cent, rebates. If that principle is accepted, why not help local authorities ease in the council tax by removing the 20 per cent, contribution? That would take the pressure off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where local authority estimates are available, they suggest that between 15 and 25 per cent, of court cases involve 20 per cent, payment cases. The courts are clogged up with such cases. One local authority puts the figure at between 30 and 40 per cent, of cases and suggests that the court time that would be released by the introduction of 100 per cent, rebates would help significantly in freeing the log-jam in the courts caused by recent poll tax and local government legislation. If only for the practical reason of easing in the council tax, the Government should abolish the 20 per cent, rule now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said, the 20 per cent, contribution is uneconomical because it costs £15 to collect £6. That principle does not apply to ordinary personal taxation—the Government and the Treasury tend to write off debts that would be too expensive to collect. The average collection cost per charge payer is about £15—two and a half times the charge payer's net contribution. It is economic nonsense to continue to insist that local authorities go through all the administrative procedures, use up computer time and so on to ensure that the minimum contribution is paid. Abolition of the 20 per cent, minimum community charge contribution for recipients of income support would ease the administrative burden on local authorities and allow a more effective use of court time and local authority resources. The Government should reconsider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must tell the Committee whether there will be real benefits from the introduction of the 100 per cent, rebate. At a meeting with the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, the Secretary of State would not commit himself on whether income support would be cut when the 100 per cent, rebates are introduced with the council tax. That is giving with one hand while taking away with the other. The Government's position on 100 per cent, rebates must be made clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 20 per cent, minimum contribution was mentioned. The 100 per cent, rebate will be introduced with the council tax under the new system. This year, the system involves a 20 per cent, minimum contribution, which is reflected in the income support settlement. All those who receive income support should be receiving that 20 per cent, in their benefit if, and only if, the councils for the areas in which they live have kept to their targets. If the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) and the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), who is gossiping, were to come to the borough of Wandsworth, they would find that all income support recipients are 100 per cent, in pocket in respect of the community charge element of
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
income support. There is no community charge, so every pound of that element of income support goes into the pockets of my less well-off constituents. I am happy to have that 20 per cent, this year. That does not prejudge the income support settlement in years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, the income support system is linked to the housing benefit system because of the old link between rates and rents. Will the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My constituents on housing benefit have had housing benefit increases where the rents have gone up, if they are on that sort of level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's remarks. When people apply for housing benefit and poll tax relief they must put on the forms exactly what the payment will be. If they are not making any payment, is the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a problem we have had. The point about this measure is the 20 per cent, that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. I turn to the complexity that the hon. Member for Dagenham was so concerned about—so concerned that he is now leaving the Committee room. The complexity of the valuation system worried him, and the thought that it might delay the implementation of the Bill. That is rich from a party which proposes to introduce a measure of rolling revaluations for 22 million properties, based on four different types of valuation. Perhaps when he returns he can tell us how many years, if not decades, it would take to implement a system based partly on maintenance repair costs, partly on rebuilding costs, partly on rental values and partly on insurance values. Four different elements for four different valuation systems. That has to be assessed in terms of the timetable for any measure that the Labour party would try to introduce.

My reason for objecting to the amendment is that the Opposition are saying, in effect, that were there to be a problem of timing in terms of implementation, the people that they would go for are the most vulnerable people in our society. Apart from people in detention, those affected by their proposed schedule are the severely mentally impaired, students, hospital patients, patients in homes in England, Wales and Scotland and care workers. Surely the Labour party is not saying that if anyone had to suffer it should be those people.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a recent intervention, the case for going back immediately to the old rates system was mentioned. This morning I referred to council estates in my constituency in which the rates payable this year, under Labour's scheme would have been £612. There was hilarity on the Opposition Benches because, as hon. Members said from a sedentary position, I had forgotten to knock off the £140. By doing so, council tenants in my area would be paying £472, which would put them in band E under the schedule. Yet those same tenants, under our scheme, would be in band E but would pay only £312. I do not think that my constituents will want to pay Labour's £472—they will be very happy with our £312.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is why, in years and policies gone by, the leader of the hon. Gentleman's party described the rating system as the most unjust of all taxes, and sought then to get rid of it.

According to the Government's figures, the council tax that would have applied for this financial year to a property in the average band in the constituency of the hon. Member for Nottingham, South was £339. Under our fair rates proposals, and in the figures that we published in

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to be a letterbox between the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo). No doubt my hon. Friend will catch your eye and return to that point, Mr. Leadbitter. I shall merely say that my constituents and, I suspect, those of my hon. Friend, do not want the Labour party's more expensive system; they do not want a delay in the implementation of the discount system, which the amendment proposes, and they certainly do not want the additional 20 per cent. that the Labour party is committed to being raised by local authorities, which would put 50 per cent. on to the council tax. For those reasons, I oppose the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good evening, Mr. Leadbitter. On Second Reading, I attempted, in my usual manner, to conclude my remarks on a positive note. I remind members of the Committee of my remarks because they are relevant to the amendment. I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I will probably be one of the Opposition members of the Standing Committee that will consider the Bill."</p></blockquote>
That was not bad for political punditry. I continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although we are opposed to it in principle, I genuinely hope that the Government will provide an opportunity to examine the workings of this complex piece of legislation and ensure that when it leaves the House it has some semblance of a workable piece of legislation. Local authority treasurers, irrespective of local authority and party, all say that the timescale within which the Government intend to introduce the council tax and the way in which they intend to force through the proposals, will leave local authorities in administrative trauma. The Government owe it to the House, local government and, more importantly, to the British people to introduce workable proposals".—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 November 1991; Vol. 198. c. 857–8.]</p></blockquote>
I made it clear that as an Opposition Member in Committee I would be looking for practical amendments that would assist the Government in developing a workable proposal, although my opposition to the Bill in principle would remain. Rather surprisingly, the Governor-General for Wales, the right hon. Member for Wirral, West (Mr. Hunt), in replying to the debate on behalf of the Government, said that he welcomed my positive approach. He clarified that by saying that he welcomed the partly positive approach adopted by myself and that he hoped that the Committee would examine the Bill carefully. Therefore, in the spirit of co-operation, I shall make my observations on the thrust of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 
	<i>The House Magazine</i> this week, the Minister of State pronounced that the property poll tax was "Easy and Equitable". He then went on to say that it "can be speedily implemented." The Minister of State has suddenly disappeared from the room, but I hope that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary will inform him of what I am about to say. 
	<i>The House Magazine</i> does not, in any sense, do the Minister of State's new plumage justice. The style and buoyancy that he now attaches to his thatch is only equalled by his assertions that there was not—indeed, there is not—an alternative to the poll tax. Indeed, the Minister's new plumage had me scurrying to read up my Oxford dictionary to find a proper phrase to describe the transformation in both looks and style of the hon. Gentleman. I took a leaf from the book of my hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and looked up the word "poll" as in poll tax. Amazingly, the dictionary defined poll as a tame parrot; user of conventional or unoriginal phrases and arguments; conventional name for a parrot. So, I would like to congratulate the hon. Gentleman on being listed in "Who's Who" and "Debrett's", and on being listed in "The Concise Oxford Dictionary".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State is to realise the assertions made by the Minister during the winding up debate on Second Reading and to qualify what he said in the magazine article about the council tax being "Easy and Equitable" and "speedily implemented", the Government will need to clear faultlessly a number of hurdles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Government will have to ensure that the starting date for the council tax of 1 April is secured, as there are real signs, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham has pointed out, that that target date will fail for many reasons to which I shall refer later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Government must properly assess the implications for the new administrative and bureaucratic regimes that will have to be established to implement the discount policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Government must deal with the review decision, confirmed on Second Reading, that there will be no 100 per cent. rebates in the final year of the poll tax, despite the widely supported principle of 100 per cent, rebates being included in the Bill that is before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 11 November 1991, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy said the following about the Bill's Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Institute is particularly concerned that the new tax should be practicable and economic to administer … It is disappointing to note that the opportunity has not been taken to provide for entitlement to Community Charge Benefit from 1st April 1992 up to a maximum of 100 per cent, in appropriate cases. In the Institute's view the simplification which this would bring would materially assist local authorities in bringing in the Council Tax successfully and on time at 1st April 1993."</p></blockquote>
The institute, which, by the way, welcomes the council tax as a replacement for the poll tax, with some reservations, has further stated that it is constructively critical of the legislation currently proposed—
	<br><blockquote><p>"There appears to be no discretionary power within the Bill as drafted for local authorities to write-off either existing Community Charge or the new Council Tax on economic grounds (i.e. when the amount of the charge is so small as to make the pursuance and collection of it administratively uneconomic)."</p></blockquote>
On 24 September 1991, the Association of Metropolitan Authorities issued a well-argued paper entitled "Poll Tax Collection", which dealt with first, the present range of problems of poll tax administration and enforcement and, secondly, the extent to which those problems could be relieved if rebates of up to 100 per cent, were available from 1 April 1992. I know that the Government received that report, but I have not, as yet, seen any evidence of the their response to it, although, of course, when they have rejected in principle the concept of 1992 we must presume that the Government have rejected the AMA's document in total. They have not had the good grace to refute publicly the arguments advanced by the AMA, the ADC and the ACC, organisations that are politically controlled by Conservative councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The AMA's report went on to make some important points about the rebate system. The Government should deal with their points and with amendment No. 18. The report stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Authorities without exception supported the introduction of 100% rebates for poll tax",</p></blockquote>
because,
	<br><blockquote><p>"—a more effective use of court time could be achieved.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>—it was uneconomic to issue warrants against those on full rebates.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>—Delays, outside the control of authorities, plus the complexity of joint and several liability proceedings reduced enormously potential fruits of attachment of benefits.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>—administrative and financial savings could be achieved at the distress stage."</p></blockquote>
The report also stated that some authorities used 65 per cent, of their time to deal with the 20 per cent, of defaulters. That is an enormous amount of time which could be used more fruitfully, either to implement the legislation to better administer the collection of poll tax arrears, or to improve methods of poll tax collection in local authority areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence of local authorities and associations that deal with local government finance shows that the Government are setting themselves against a principle of fairness, proper administration and financial accountability. The Government should consider the amendment carefully on the grounds of fairness and economy. They should introduce proposals for 100 per cent, rebates beginning in the financial year 1992–93.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second piece of advice is about ensuring appropriate resources so that 1 April 1993 is a realistic date to begin to implement the property poll tax. In a parliamentary answer on 4 November the Minister announced that a grant of 75 per cent.—equivalent to £86 million—would be made towards the cost of local authorities preparing for the council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy stated that the figure was less than that required for local authorities to implement the proposals fairly and equitably within the time scale set by the Government. That was an independent assessment, not motivated by political malice. The Institute consists neither of local authority representatives of a party or of local government officials who want more time to implement the legislation. It is a professional, independent organisation that stands on the sidelines, and says that the Government have got the proposal badly wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is there a question mark about the implementation date of 1 April 1993? Perhaps we should ask the Audit Commission, which is a creature of the Government. The Secretary of State conceived of the Audit Commission to show the way to good financial management and practice in the formulation and delivery of local authority services. The Audit Commission responded to the consultation paper issued by the Department of the Environment in April 1991 by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"this timetable is far tighter than for the community charge. There were over four years between the publication of the Green Paper in January 1986 and the introduction of community charge in April 1990. There will be only two years between the Consultation Paper and the proposed introduction of the council tax."</p></blockquote>
The Audit Commission responded to the White Paper by saying that unless the Government heeded its recommendations, the date for the introduction of the legislation might have to be set aside. I have not seen any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
public response by the Government to the precise and concise recommendations by the independent Audit Commission. The Government are clearly worried about the problems associated with the timetable, as they have employed a firm of consultants who, astonishingly reported at a meeting on 18 November, at which Department of the Environment officials and representatives of local associations were present, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Backlogs of poll tax will knock council tax over if anything will".</p></blockquote>
The Government's paid consultants added that problems could be eased by giving 100 per cent, rebates for poll tax in 1992–93. Those consultants asked local authorities about the implementation of the timetable and as recently as the past few days the Department has said that unless the 100 per cent, rebate system is introduced, the Government will have serious problems in successfully implementing the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have the Goverment rejected this advice? If so, what did they tell their consultants, who independently assessed local authorities' capability to introduce the new legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultants were equally scathing about discounts. They said that they were an untried and untested concept, that problem areas had arisen and would arise and that unless authorities were given assistance in preparing the software and helped with administration, serious problems would arise about who was entitled to a discount. They said that from day one the system would be in difficulties. If that happens, the Government's claim that the council tax is fairer than the poll tax will go down the tube. The public will see it as unfair, unworkable and similar to the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government want to demonstrate their political management skills in implementing the Bill they owe it to themselves to listen to their consultants who say that, unless they change tack on the fundamental issue of 100 per cent, rebates in the financial year 1992–93, they will put at risk all the concepts that they hold dear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a cynical Back Bench Opposition Member I should sit tight. We should not have tabled the amendment, because it would assist the Government. That is not the Opposition's role, particularly at this late stage of a Parliament. However, as legislators, we have an overall responsibility to ensure that when the Bill leaves the Committee it has at least a chance of helping those it is intended to assist. So it is vital that the Minister responds positively to the views expressed by professional organisations who are keenly interested in the passage of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote CIPFA again, but I make it clear that I am not a consultant—paid or otherwise—for that body. I say that because when Conservative Members contribute to a debate we usually find that they are consultants for one or other organisation. I am quoting CIPFA because it offers independent and sensible proposals on the Bill. It told the Government as recently as a fortnight ago that they should reassess the resources being provided to local authorities for the revenue costs of implementing the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State and some of his colleagues regularly visit my constituency and the borough of Wigan to publicise the good work of my authority. My secretary keeps two diaries—one for Mr. M and the other for Mr. P. In the past 12 months the Minister of State has often visited my constituency to congratulate the local authority on the work that it does independently or jointly with the
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
private and voluntary sectors. As the authority has been given so many plaudits on standard spending assessments, one might expect that to be reflected in its grant. However, the Secretary of State for the Environment poll tax capped it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such poll tax capped authorities, which are trying to cope as best they can on limited budgets and without knowing what will happen next year, need to be aware early on that the full revenue costs of implementing the new legislation will fall on the Exchequer. Whey should at least 25 per cent. of the total cost of the legislation designed to get rid of the poll tax fall on the new council tax payer? It is the Government's responsibility to rid themselves of the poll tax, yet the council tax payer will have to pay a considerable sum to implement the proposals to do just that. The Government should accept 100 per cent, of the revenue costs of introducing the proposed changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must be realistic about the implementation of this tight time scale by accepting the amendment and acknowledging the necessity of introducing 100 per cent, rebates in the financial year 1992–93.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end with a warning of what local authorities now call the poll tax decay factor. The Government must deal with three main areas. First, Government propaganda to convince people that the poll tax has ended has transformed itself into a backlog of people who are unwilling to pay the continuing cost of the poll tax. The Government owe it to local authorities to provide financial resources for a propaganda campaign to make it clear that the poll tax remains and that bills must be paid until 1 April 1993. They should provide resources for television advertising, for advertisements on hoardings and for leafleting every house, as they intend to do for much of their other business between now and the election. They will not do that, of course, because the last thing they want is to remind the British public that they will continue the poll tax until 1993, at the earliest. So the decay factor will carry on working between now and 1993 at the expense of poll tax payers and local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Government should stop unfair political attacks. I am happy to mete out and to take political attacks as between opponents. However, it is a bit rich for a Minister to come continually to a constituency, to send civil servants to advise its local authority on value for money for services, and then to attack it publicly for being profligate—and finally to poll tax cap it. The Secretary of State should cease deliberately motivated political attacks on local authorities and begin the job of presenting a good view of what happens in local authorities in the United Kingdom. Much of the good work in the redevelopment of inner cities, in the clearance of land dereliction, in training and development and in inward investment stems from the willingness of local authorities to co-operate with the private and voluntary sectors. It is about time the Secretary of State and the Minister recognised that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Government have a responsibility to give additional resources to tackle collection and enforcement difficulties. The longer the poll tax stays on the statute book, the more people will choose not to make the 20 per cent, payment. The Government should cut their losses and introduce the rebate system a year earlier. They would get public support for that, both from inside and outside the Labour party. All the professional, tenants' and residents' organisations and groups that represent the community in Britain would support that decision
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
wholeheartedly. It is now up to the Government to take the opportunity and to support my hon. Friend's amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have twice sought to offer the Committee figures from my constituency which have been derided by the Opposition Benches. Someone, from a sedentary position, muttered that I was quoting Mickey Mouse figures. My constituency is average in terms of income, property values and the cost of living, so the figures from my area are all the more relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to record some figures that I am happy to have challenged at any time, now or in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to one of the better areas in my constituency. A household in the Woolaton Abbey area of my constituency paid £650 a year in rates in the years 1988–90. It is not in dispute in my constituency that, had the rates remained, and given the support grant that has flowed to our area in the past two years, the spending pattern of our city and county would have produced a rates bill for the same household of £994·50.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members intervened this morning to say that I had forgotten that the household would have the benefit of the £140 reduction that the Chancellor introduced in the Budget. At best, the household would have gone from paying £650 in 1989–90, to paying £854·50, with the £140 knocked off. However, the houses in that area are likely to be in group D—some may be in group E. Under the Government's scheme, that household will pay just over £400 or, at least, well below £500. By any yardstick, the households in the better areas of my constituency will be happier with the Government's proposals than with even the most optimistic suggestions from Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More importantly, in my constituency, more than half the properties are either council properties or ex-council properties. On the Clifton estate, the second largest in England, the average rates bill in 1989–90 was about £400. Under the same formula that I suggested a few moments ago, that Bill would have gone up to £612 in 1991–92 and with the £140 knocked off, to £472. There is no doubt that 90 per cent, of those properties—I am probably right to say 100 per cent, of them—will be in band B. Under the Government's proposals, the households on the Clifton estate will have a maximum bill of £312.

The hon. Gentleman may not wish to rely on Government figures or any other figures, but what does he rely on? There are no council tax bills yet, thank heavens, but the Government have presented figures for the city of Nottingham, for every other district in Nottinghamshire and for every local authority district in the country. I want to know where his figures come from, because they do not tally with any of the figures provided by the Government.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the hon.

I am capable of using those figures, and happy to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me go one stage further and be as generous as I can to the Mickey Mouse calculator used by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). Let us assume that all the properties were two-person households, although we know that they were not. In my most expensive example, the figure would have fallen to £854·50; it would have fallen to £714·50 if I had taken off £280. That is still £300 more than the figure under the Government's scheme. If I had subtracted £140 twice from the figure for the Clifton household, the Government's scheme would still be better than the Labour party's proposition.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nottingham's figure for band B would be £329. That is the average band and most people would accept it to be so. The hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: From memory, I gave the hon. Gentleman the figure of £490 for band E. I am sorry that I was £20 out. For band B, I quoted £312 and he gives us £329. I did not have the precise figures but my case still stands up—
	<i>[Interruption]</i> I am quite content to be £20 out. The hon. Member for Dagenham sits laughing, but we are dealing with constituents' known rate bills. We know what they were charged under the old rating system and what they would pay under the Government's proposals. It is clear that people haven't a clue what they will have to pay under the Labour party's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have been critical and have queried why the Government are not picking up costs stemming from the abolition of the poll tax. The hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) made that point. The Committee should be made aware of an important factor. The cost of financing the scheme has meant £44·75 for every chargeable adult in Nottingham. In the neighbouring borough of Gedling, the equivalent sum is £3·50. I suggest that that discrepancy has little to do with the Government, and everything to do with the authority, Nottingham city council, whose costs are more than 10 times those of the neighbouring authority of Gedling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far, parrots, Mickey Mouse and cuckoos have featured in our debate, and it seems that those birds and the imaginary animal can make as much sense of the supposed coherent taxation policy as the Government in their council tax proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial question is whether the council tax can be implemented by 1993 in a way that avoids the chaos, the misery, the cost and the dislocation of local services that resulted from implementation of the poll tax? Conservative Members keep saying that it is a different tax, but they keep referring to "this community charge". The problem for local authorities is that they have to implement the new council tax and clear up the substantial mess and chaos that will be left in the poll tax's wake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have admitted that the poll tax did not and cannot work. They discovered that it was unpopular, unworkable and uncollectable, and that it
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
made them unelectable. They think that the Bill will somehow set them in a better light. In an article in the 
	<i>Daily Mail</i> of 24 November 1990, the Prime Minister said of the poll tax:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I'll tell you the trouble with the poll tax"—</p></blockquote>
he had only just discovered it—
	<br><blockquote><p>"We were bounced into it quickly".</p></blockquote>
Who is "we"? The Government decided to introduce the poll tax; so how can they bounce themselves into implementing it? Perhaps the Prime Minister has been living in a sort of suspended animation for the past 12 years and does not understand that he leads a party that bears the full responsibility for introducing the poll tax. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We were bounced into it quickly because there was such a fuss about rates in Scotland and we were bounced without thinking because of the political fuss."</p></blockquote>
Well, there is nothing new in this Government acting before thinking through a policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council tax is now on the same trajectory as that of the poll tax. Many proposals in the council tax, such as personal discounts, have not been worked out in detail. They may sound like a good idea—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) has gone out to tend his sheep.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has probably gone to work out the money that he would save under Labour's proposals, which would give him enough money to feed his sheep.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A personal discount may sound all right to some, but it would prove difficult to come up with concrete proposals that could be implemented. Frankly, some of the Government's assumptions about households are less than realistic. Even if the Bill receives Royal Assent before April, local authorities will not be able to commission new computer systems until the regulations are approved. It would be imprudent and costly to invest large sums in developing software to implement draft regulations, which could easily be changed before being approved by Parliament. Local authorities will have less than one year to complete all the necessary development work. That is exactly what happened with the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the chaos of the poll tax was caused by the fact that rebate schemes were not ready. Local authorities needed rebate regulations at least 12 months in advance to get their systems ready. However, the timetable for the social security legislation that is linked to the Bill is more uncertain than that of the council tax proper. As was said earlier, schedule 9 will provide a framework for council tax rebates by amending and consolidating the text of two social security Bills. The timetable for those Bills has not yet been announced, and we do not know when they will receive Royal Assent. The Government are determined to use the fast track to introduce the council tax, but they do not bother to ensure that rebates and discounts will also be ready. If the rebate regulations are not approved by Parliament before April, we could be heading for a council tax scheme in 1993 that will become embedded in as much chaos as the poll tax before it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have demonstrated how little they understand these matters. They have said that a register of council tax payers would not be required. Paragraph 2.6 of "A new tax for local government" states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A significant advantage of the discount approach is that there is no need for a register of council tax payers."</p></blockquote>
Local authorities had to maintain a register of poll tax payers. Registration officers had powers to designate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
responsible individuals, who were under a duty to provide them with such information as they were able to discover about people because councils needed the information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no provision in the Bill to empower authorities to establish a register to enable them to administer the council tax efficiently. Indeed, the Government have said that a register is unnecessary. But, to be able to administer council tax, local councils will have to know who to send bills to, how many persons over age 18 are in a property and whether any should be treated as "invisible"? Each time a person moves into or out of a property, his status changes. All this could affect payment of council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without a register, how will councils know whether a single person household remains so? What will happen if a partner moves on? Will there be a requirement for the council to be informed? Will councils have to keep an eye on relationships to know whose are developing and whose are declining so as to keep a fair assessment of their tax base for the collection of council tax?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Council tax bills will not be straightforward in households with a number of adults who move in and out during a year, or if residents change. For example, what effect will there be on the bill of a single working mother whose 20-year-old daughter comes home from college in the summer vacation? What about couples, if the man lives at home for only three months in a year because he works and lives outside Britain, or works away from home for long periods? The Government have failed to learn the most significant lessons from the administrative nightmare that was created by the poll tax. People, unlike properties, move around. The Audit Commission has commented clearly on the difficulties of maintaining registers and information. Any tax that has a person element is feasible only in a society where individual adults stay in one place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem for local authorities in trying to implement the council tax is that much of the poll tax will continue, and the mess that it has created will have a profound influence on whether regulations for the council tax work properly. The deterioration in the administration and enforcement of poll tax collection will, for the remainder of its time, place enormous strains on local authorities as they attempt to deal with yet another new tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about those whose lives have been made miserable by the poll tax—those who have faced the appalling prospect of threats of bailiffs, attachment of earnings orders and the problems of responding to bills when systems are changing constantly? Have the Government not learnt anything from all this? Do they feel no responsibility except to make their avaricious run to get re-elected? What about those who experience taxation systems?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The councill tax will be an administrative nightmare. The anomalies and thus hardships of the poll tax must be taken into account in assessing whether we can have a system of taxation ready for 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Poll tax rebate systems have been so complicated that councils have been thrown into administrative confusion in trying to cope with them. Many constituents who applied for rebates were unemployed and eligible for them, but still they were sent full poll tax demands, which were followed by summonses, bailiffs and distress warrants. Other mistakes abound due to the complexity of administering the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
The Government must face the fact that people on low incomes cannot afford to pay the taxes that they now seek to levy. The only fair approach would be a tax based on ability to pay.

In my constituency, a young man aged 22 was sent to prison—incorrectly, as it turned out—because he had been sent the wrong bill. The court had refused to believe him when he said that he was not liable for the full bill and sent him to prison. He was released a day later. However, after he had paid his commitments to housing costs, he had £3·40 a week left from his benefit to pay the poll tax, and he will not be a lot better off under the council tax. How can that possibly be justice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady said—I hope that I quote her correctly—that the only just system for collecting council revenue at local level is one that is completely related to ability to pay. I do not support it, but surely the only system which delivers that is the local income tax system proposed by the Liberal Democrats. Are we witnessing a conversion by the socialists to the Liberal Democrats' stance on this important matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman recognises a socialist when he sees her or him on the other side of the Committee Room. I said that the payment of the local rate had to be linked to an ability to pay.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady might consider that this afternoon she has also made an extraordinary conversion to the community charge. Her earlier argument—wholly against any sensitivity for the electoral needs of the people, their ability to pay, where they live, or anything else—was, in fact, in favour of the simplest possible system. That can be achieved only by a flat-rate payment system, which we introduced with the community charge. That proved unacceptable to the electorate and they demanded the enormous welter of detail which reflected an individual ability to pay. That is the reason for the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am eternally grateful that my constituents are considerably more sophisticated than some of the arguments advanced today by Conservative Members. I assure the Committee that no one in my constituency is under any illusion about what I think of the poll tax or, indeed, about what the Labour party thinks of it, and why we do not support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of implementing a council tax when it is not known how it will work, how to get the administration in place, let alone the cost of its implementation, at the same time as running down the current poll tax regulations and collection, will create an impossible task for local authorities. That will waste enormous amounts of valuable resources, which my hon. Friends have already said could well be spent on the delivery of services. The poll tax backlog will knock council tax over if anything will because the two systems cannot be run together.

The Government have not listened and learnt from the experience of trying to implement the poll tax, and they have not listened to the professional bodies that are now patiently explaining—goodness knows why they maintain their patience—why the council tax is equally problematic. It has been said that the Department of the Environment is preparing to take a gamble on the size of the first council tax bills and risk everything to try to bail the Government out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its submission, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Complex discount arrangements, and the need to prepare legislation and software could jeopardise the April 1993 target date".</p></blockquote>
It continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Specific grant aid, matching councils' costs pound for pound, should, therefore, be provided to enable the introduction of the new tax in parallel with the running down of the community charge".</p></blockquote>
There are no proposals for that either. The passage continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The institute believes that, when personal discounts are introduced, some form of local tax register will have to emerge to reduce evasion and promote even-handed administration."</p></blockquote>
The treasurer of the Wigan, Greater Manchester local authority, told a seminar of Labour-controlled associations and metropolitan authorities that there simply was not enough time for properties to be valued accurately for the proposed seven bands. He envisaged mass appeals from those on the margins of those bands. Another local treasurer said that the timetable was too tight, which made it impossible to implement the proceedings correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The information technology departments of councils stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The introduction of the council tax puts enormous pressure on information technology (IT) departments that have to make it work. Compiling poll tax bills has already created a data processing nightmare and IT staff feel they have been at the sharp end of political hesitation and wrangling."</p></blockquote>
No doubt that also applied to the Conservative party when it was debating whether to change its leader last year. The IT departments continue
	<br><blockquote><p>"Now local government IT managers are having to choose a system on which to run the new tax without knowing exactly what that system will be required to do."</p></blockquote>
That is no way to attempt to finance local authorities and enable them to be accountable and democratic. The services on which so many people depend are heading for disaster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Bristol and Avon local authorities for the percentage of houses in the different Government bands. They said that they could not tell me as much research would be required to obtain such information, which they did not currently hold. I also asked what safeguards in valuation guidelines existed to ensure that Inland Revenue valuations were commensurate with the valuations of the 75 per cent, of properties put out to estate agents? They replied that there was no consistency as far as they knew. When I asked for the estimated cost of the change-over to the new system and the effect on staffing, redundancy and recruitment requirements, they could not tell me. Will the average value in the city be near the Government's estimated £80,000? If it is lower, will it mean a shortfall in council income over the levy assumed by the Government? At this stage, neither council can answer my questions because neither one can devote the necessary resources to obtain the information that is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
To pretend otherwise is to treat those who work hard in local authorities with utter contempt. The Government are setting local authorities impossible tasks. They are asking them to administer impossible legislation that will result in the running down of services, and cause many people to experience pressure and misery. The Bill is not a sensible measure. It is being rushed through the House because the Prime Minister is frightened of being bounced out of office by the electorate. The amendment seeks modestly to find a way to protect those who will be at the sharp end of ill-thought-out proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that no Conservative Members have jumped to their feet to defend the Government's proposals. I think that that is because of their embarrassment. I wonder whether Conservative Members really understand what they will inflict on local government. A few minutes ago, it was said that the poll tax had the virtue of being fairly easy to understand because every person, with only some exceptions, paid the same sum of money. We must consider, however, what was inflicted on local authorities as a result of the poll tax and what is still being inflicted on them. Local authorities must know the exact number of adults who live within their areas. Given that that comprises a shifting population, that poses problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities must know which couples are subject to joint and several liability legislation. The number of such people change year after year. Local authorities have had to know which households should pay specific poll tax demands because there are three different levels of poll tax. They must know which households are exempted and which are entitled to 80 per cent, rebate. Now on top of those continuing problems of changing statistics, their software must now be devoted to banding properties and calculating which people are eligible for discount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government realise that the entire valuation must be completed before the property poll tax billing can begin? Conservative Members cannot respond to that point, because they are waiting for a civil servant to give them the answer. Logically speaking, the valuation must be completed, even if entire streets will be valued off-the cuff at a price of, say, 80p a throw. Local authorities cannot send out the bills until they know exactly how many houses fall into each of the bands. That will apply even if most of the houses clearly fall within a given band. The councils cannot decide on what bills to send each household until they know the full valuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities will face further complexities because there will not be an equal number of houses in each band to work out the sum that will produce the approximate 15 per cent, that they will be required to raise locally. The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities is nodding. Such complex work will put local authorities under immense pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Conservative Members may believe that such a system will be easier and quicker to operate than the rating system, but clearly it will not. The Bill will add further complexities to those being faced by local government now. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo) said, the task of local authorities can be developed only when the Bill is enacted. Until that time, they will not know what instructions to issue. When a person says that he or she is entitled to the 25 per cent, discount, how will the local authority know whether that is true? That question has not been answered by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
Conservative Members. The local authority will hardly take an individual's word for it. How will it check that claim? How long do the Government think that it will take local authorities to check all those claims that may come in—some genuinely erroneous and mistaken, others dishonest in the hope of obtaining a discount to which there is no entitlement? How long will that process take? I hope that Conservative Members will not say that all that can be dealt with in regulations. The matter is fundamental and must be decided before billing can begin. Those problems and complexities will be inflicted on people year after year on top of tidying up the poll tax mess. The Government must have it in for local authorities, even those that are Tory-led, to want to impose such nonsense upon them when we could have a straightforward rate system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I am relieved to discover that my hon. Friends are awake. It has been a long and wide-ranging debate. I shall try to pull together as many of its strands as possible. I shall bear in mind the strictures from Opposition Members about shortage of time and try to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment reflects Opposition doubts about the Bill's discount provisions and the ability of local authorities to perpare for them. The amendment is unnecessary. The discounts will be straightforward and easy to administer. Most households will receive and pay a standard bill. Local authorities already have much information on single-person households, students and so on from existing records. I shall return to that matter, which has worried some people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill requires local authorities to take reasonable steps to ascertain discount entitlement—another matter to which I shall return. If local authorities have no information, they will be able to send a standard bill. Any household that receives a standard bill will be able to inform the local authority if it believes that it is entitled to a discount. There is no need for a register of households. For most households, the number and status of residents will be of no concern to local authorities. There will be a duty on those who receive a discount to tell the local authority when entitlement ceases or is reduced. A register would add nothing of use to local authorities.

The hon. Member for Bristol, South asked about single-person households. The bills of single mothers will not be affected by the return of a 20-year-old daughter during a vacation as the hon.

Friend the Secretary of State said, students are invisible for the purposes of the council tax.

	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh, a leak."] It has been well publicised—it must have been, to have reached a lowly Opposition Back-Bench Member. The document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a person entitled to a status discount in a 2-person household is the liable person, he will be billed as a single person household: but if there are 2 other adults in the household, neither of whom qualify for the discount, he will

	<i>and</i> second person CTB (a 25 per cent, reduction in his bill), the status discount will trump the second person CTB."</p></blockquote>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can help the hon. Lady. I always try to help her—her constituency is not far from mine. However, I warn her against believing every leak that she finds. The document that she quoted was taken from a working paper of the benefits sub-group, which was set-up by the Department of Social Security. It set out proposals for discussion.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall debate the formulae later in our proceedings. I shall be delighted to discuss them in detail then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made a point earlier about the use of existing records. People outside the Committee suggested that using the community charge register might prove problematic. There is no problem. It is perfectly legal for a local authority to use that register to discover who lives where. The hon. Lady might claim, with justification, that that has been a problem under the community charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides for the use of information from the register. We have held constructive discussions with the Data Protection Registrar, who is generally content with our proposals.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made an interesting point, which could enlighten members of the Committee on whether a new register should be created. Does he believe that there is no reason why local authorities should not use the community charge register and does that include maintaining the register?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall discuss that point later in proceedings; it is not covered by the clause.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon.

The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) raised important points about social security legislation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) said, the two Bills consolidate legislation and bring together existing provisions. It is important to recognise that both Bills were introduced on 4 November and published on 5 November. They do not change existing law, as is usual practice. The Bill amends the consolidating legislation, and all the changes to provide for the council tax benefit are in schedule 9, which we will consider a little later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek some reassurance. How much of the income support will be included for the 20 per cent., or rather the 100 per cent? When an amount was last put in social security legislation in 1989, it was only uprated in line with the normal social security uprating and did not take into account the increases in local levels of poll tax. People therefore got less benefit than they needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) talked about the Audit Commission. The Audit Commission says that we should have milestones and that we should make every effort to reach them. That was the point that the hon. Gentleman left out. The Audit Commission was quite positive, and I well remember hearing the chairman of the commission saying just that. As regards community charge collection, six out of 10 local authorities did better in the second quarter of this year than in the same period last year. I see no reason to suppose that that trend will not continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not dispute the English figures, but we are now into the third year of collection in Scotland, not the second year. That experience is not repeated in Scotland. The third year is considerably worse than the second year and the second year was considerably worse than the first year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one important difference between England and Scotland: rather more Labour Members in Scotland have encouraged people not to pay. Many speakers have spoken about the possibility that we will not be ready for the council tax, but that is nonsense. Full discussions have been taking place with local authorities since last summer. We have said that we will consult on draft regulations over the next few months and we will also issue detailed practice notes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
The system is administratively simple, and there will also be about half the number of bills for local authorities to distribute. I have already referred to the fact that there is no need for a register, and discount and rebate procedures will be as simple as they possibly can be. We are co-operating fully with local authorities and the computer industry on council tax software. We will have a further meeting with the council tax software providers in the next week or so to take discussions forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not being unfair when I only quoted briefly. I had about eight pages of recommendations from the Audit Commission which, to save the hon. Gentleman embarrassment, I have decided to keep for another debate. On 18 November, as part of the consultation procedure between his Department and the local authorities, it was clearly shown that the consultants felt that a 100 per cent, rebate introduced in 1992–93 was the one sure way of keeping the legislation on track. If that is consultation, which I accept it is, why does not the Minister accept that finding; or does he intend only to accept findings that comply with his narrow thinking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The local authorities are not saying in discussions with the Department that they are unable to introduce the council tax by 1 April 1993. Far from it. Moreover, if there is so little time, how could authorities set up the Opposition's rate system, complete with debates, by 1 April 1993—when the Opposition have not even drafted any serious legislation? It is an absurd proposition and a silly argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we considered the study of preparation costs for the council tax, we appointed CSL as independent consultants. CSL has substantial and direct experience of the management of local authority revenue collection. The consultants looked in detail at 30 local authorities in England and Wales. There is no suggestion in their report that any of the authorities will be unable to meet the deadline of 1 April 1993 for the council tax. According to the consultants, those authorities will be implementing the council tax with a wealth of experience gained from introducing the community charge. That should facilitate a cost-effective and efficient introduction of the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that the report also stated that for local authorities to meet the 1 April 1993 deadline, many other factors must be considered, including the provision of software, staffing and other facilties that must be sorted out between the Department of the Environment and the local authorities? Is that not part of the exercise that has not yet been defined?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. It is interesting, that many Opposition Members have quoted from documents prepared many months ago. I do not think that the Committee should be under any illusions—a great deal has happened in recent weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
References have been made to transitional arrangements. There will indeed be special arrangements to ensure that households will not face unreasonable increases in their bills because of the introduction of the new system. The framework for that transitional system is being discussed with local authority representatives.

The timetable for the introduction of these proposals is challenging, but I am convinced that it can be achieved. We know that the council tax will be simpler and easier to administer and that there is no need for a register. The

	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
council tax is accountable and fair and no one will bear a disproportionate share of local government taxation. Returning to the point where I started, I believe that the amendment is unnecessary and I urge the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I distinctly heard the Minister say that he would return to the issue of discounts for single persons. I believe that he said that he would deal with that point, but he has not done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, he did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Cohen, are we going to hear some wise words from you?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope so, Mr. Leadbitter. I know that it is unusual to speak after the Minister has made what many thought would be a winding-up speech However, I had to leave the Committee at about 7 pm for a meeting of a parliamentary Labour party committee, of which I am the chairman—I was elected unanimously at its annual general meeting—so I could not speak before the Minister. Before Conservative Members cheer, let me point out the contrast between the parliamentary Labour party committee and the parliamentary Conservative party committee on Europe, which met last week and had a putsch against its chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us which committee it was?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I think that we can honestly say that it was not the European committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some might feel that that was the extent of my wise words, Mr. Leadbitter. I would appreciate
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
attempting to press on, albeit for a very short while, and I shall find another opportunity to come back on the substantive matters. I was flabberghasted by the Minister's comment—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It was the Parliamentary Labour party defence committee, of which I also speak with great wisdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. Did the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) mean the parliamentary anti-defence Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Labour has a much better defence policy than the Conservative party, but I shall be pulled up if I go down that road.

As I was saying, I was flabberghasted by the Minister's references to a document produced by CSL which was commissioned by his Department. He said that everything was rosy and that the programme's implementation—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am paraphrasing—was on schedule. CSL's report was published in September 1991. Let me read just two paragraphs. Page 13 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Approximately 75 per cent. of authorities in the sample have said that the backlogs are in one or more of the areas of Community Charge register maintenance, recovery or benefits. Although efforts are being made by these authorities to clear the backlogs"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is committing a serious offence. He is interfering with the Chairman's appetite. We are now going to dinner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
