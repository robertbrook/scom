	<p>Amendment Regulations 1999</p>

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Social Security (New Deal Pilot) Amendment Regulations 1999.</p></blockquote>
I am happy to be sitting on the Committee with you, Mr. Cunningham, in the Chair for the first time. We have not so far been together in the same Committee Room, but I hope that this will be the first of many such sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations were laid before the House on 22 February. They support the new deal pilot schemes introduced at the end of November to help back into work people aged over 25 who have been unemployed for at least 12 or 18 months. Building on the new deal for people aged 25 and over, which was introduced in June, the purpose of the pilots is to find new and effective ways of providing help to unemployed people in that age group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pilots operate throughout Northern Ireland and in 28 mainland areas. They place a heavy emphasis on innovation and flexibility for the partnerships and organisations that deliver them. The regulations enable the pilot providers to try out additional ways of encouraging and supporting people in moving back into work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before dealing with the detail of the regulations, I should quickly outline some of the basic features of the pilots to set the additional provisions before the Committee in their proper context. The pilots will offer help in the pilot areas to people aged 25 and over who reach a particular threshold of unemployment. Eighteen pilots include people unemployed for 18 months or more, and the other 10 target people unemployed for 12 months or more. The Government are also measuring the impact of offering help before the 12 or 18-month stage to people who have a specific disadvantage in the labour market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall outline the basic framework for the pilots. They are based on lessons learned from the 18–24 new deal and involve a gateway period of 13 weeks or, in exceptions, up to 17 weeks. A period of intensive activity will follow, usually lasting 13 weeks, to tackle barriers to work. Available help may include work experience with a potential employer, job-related training or assistance into self employment. Finally, a follow-through period will apply for anyone who has not found work at the end of the intensive activity period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The Government consulted widely on the content of the pilot schemes. In response, partnership and private sector providers have requested additional flexibilities. Two consistent requests emerged from the consultation. Providers asked for a facility to help people who wish to start their own businesses and for wider scope to use top-up payments to assist participants into work. The regulations will enable us to respond positively to both requests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I should deal with test trading. The regulations extend the special rules for self employment that already exist in the new deal for 18 to 24-year-olds to participants in the pilots. With the agreement of the participant and the new deal adviser, the participant will be able to opt to trade as a self-employed person. As the participant will remain on jobseekers allowance, however, special arrangements will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gross receipts and expenses relating to the businesses of such participants will be handled through a special account administered by the new deal provider. Start—up capital, which may include grants from organisations such as the Prince's Trust or loans will be disregarded as capital for up to 52 weeks in JSA and income-related benefits. Such capital may be held separately from the special account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Test trading may continue for up to six months, or until participants have accrued £2,000 in their special accounts after payment of expenses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Collins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Westmorland and Lonsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify one point? She said that the special accounts are to be held under the control of the new deal adviser. Will they be interest—bearing accounts with banks or building societies, or will they be kept exactly as they are, turning over as new money is paid in according to income from the trading?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that they are just ordinary accounts. I am being nodded at, so that must be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The test trading may continue for a period of six months or until participants have accrued £2,000. The agreements made with the pilot providers will ensure that the proceeds of special accounts will be payable immediately to people who leave JSA or income support to go into work. If people remain on JSA or income support, the proceeds of the account will be payable 13 weeks after they cease test trading, or immediately if they leave JSA or income support before the end of the 13-week period. If people move off JSA and claim an in work benefit, the funds in the special account will then be treated as capital. The measures are designed to provide people with an extra incentive to move off JSA and into work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain the limits that the regulations place on test trading. The focus of the pilots is firmly on moving people from welfare into work. It is therefore important to have a framework that provides participants with support and encouragement as they start up their own business, but also does not retain people on JSA for any longer than is necessary. Participants will be supported throughout the test trading period by a new deal adviser. As the enterprise develops, the adviser will be on hand to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
discuss the viability of the business and, where the business is showing signs of success, to discuss the point at which it is sensible for the participant to leave benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £2,000 limit is designed to provide focus for that consideration. Clearly, if a participant reaches that level of profit early on in the test trading period, an early move off benefit will be appropriate. That will allow the participant to obtain the profit from the business and move on to economic independence. On the other hand, if after 26 weeks a participant has still not achieved a £2,000 profit, he may need to discuss with the adviser his future chances of success. The limit also ensures that people do not build up large profits while receiving benefits that are designed for those who are unable to sustain themselves by employment. To achieve that, the regulations provide that when the £2,000 limit is reached, test trading will come to an end. The normal jobseeker's allowance rules for people who are working will then apply if the participant continues to trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the second issue of additional payment flexibilities. The proposed regulations will allow partnerships that wish to extend the intensive activity period for some people to continue to pay top-up grant beyond the 13 weeks. They also introduce further disregards in the treatment of income and capital to allow top-up payments funded from other sources—for example, the European social fund—to be made after the first 13 weeks in addition to JSA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may find it helpful if I give examples of how two partnerships would like to use the payment flexibilities that are provided for by the regulations. Bexley and Greenwich want to extend the intensive activity period by five weeks for about 25 per cent, of entrants, using European social fund funds. During those five weeks, the partnership would like to pay participants up to £15 a week on top of their JSA and other benefits because that will help it to prepare people, through core skills training, to work on the millennium experience. There will be a guaranteed job interview at the end of the extra five weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The partnership in west Lancashire would like the flexibility to extend the intensive activity period by up to six weeks for individuals who, because their barriers to getting into work are severe, have not had time during the first 13 weeks to get a work trial with an employer. The six weeks would then be spent in the workplace of an employer who has a longer term vacancy to fill. The idea is to give the participant time to get used to the workplace and prove his or her worth to the employer. During that period the partnership would like to continue to pay people the £15.38 a week top-up payment paid during the first 13 weeks. It anticipates that about 5 to 10 per cent, of those who enter the intensive activity period will move into an extended period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations contain a technical amendment to the New Deal Pilot Regulations 1998, which corrects a minor drafting error. The amendment will ensure that payments made to participants by the Employment Service in respect of child care costs are disregarded, as was intended by the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The additional flexibilities that the regulations will give to the new deal pilots for people aged 25 and over
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
respond directly to the messages from our consultation. I believe that they strongly support the overall objective of new deal pilots, which is to test out new and innovative ways of helping people back into work. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.39 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Collins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should also like to express my pleasure at serving on this Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Cunningham. It is a particular pleasure because I have, slightly unusually, a speaking role—at any moment now, my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) is likely to leap to his feet to speak in the Chamber.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear at the outset that Opposition Members welcome any and every measure which, in the words of the preamble to the regulations,
	<br><blockquote><p>"will, or will be likely to, encourage persons to obtain work or will, or will be likely to, facilitate the obtaining by persons of work".</p></blockquote>
That must be something on which hon. Members from all parties can agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we left office after the last general election, the Conservatives bequeathed to the incoming Government the fastest growing economy in Europe and the fastest falling rate of unemployment in Europe. We are delighted that the Government are seeking to build on that record, but it is important to reflect on the reason why the Government are in a position to bring forward extensions of the original new deal, which was targeted at 18 to 24-year-olds, so that it will be targeted at unemployment among those aged 25 and above.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When he was in Opposition, the current Chancellor said that the new deal—an idea that he had plucked from thin air—would result in a reduction in youth unemployment of a certain figure, which he specified. By the time of the last general election, however, successful growth in the UK economy meant that there was not that number of youth unemployed around, even in 1997; more will have found employment since as a result of the natural carry-over of the policies of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are pleased that the Government are in a position to build on that success, but the key test of the regulations will be whether, when taken along with other Government measures, they will result in lower rather than higher unemployment in the next couple of years. I would be delighted if the Minister said whether she accepts that that is the test to which the regulations and other Government measures should be subjected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be said that there are some indications that the Government are not terribly optimistic about the impact of the regulations and other measures. We learnt in the past few days that the Government's internal estimate is that unemployment is likely to rise by about 400,000 over the next two years, and it gives me no pleasure to point out that we have heard today about a rise in the unemployment figures of 37,000. Let us hope that the regulations will help to improve those figures and get people out of unemployment and into self-employment in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
It is important to stress that if the Government's intention is for the regulations to make it easier for unemployed people to become self-employed—as I genuinely believe it is—that must be a good thing. As an aspiration, it has the absolute support of every Opposition Member. I would point out that in our term of office, we tripled the number of self-employed people, so we are delighted that the Government are seeking to move in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, support for the Government's aspirations does not mean that we can be released from our obligation to hold the Government to account for the practical and detailed effect of their policies. The Minister touched on the fact that the regulations relate to the 28 pilot schemes aimed at 25-plus age group which have been running since the end of November last year. I appreciate that it is very early days, but will she tell us roughly how successful those pilots have been and whether it is yet possible to ascertain any difference between the different forms and the different providers of those pilots?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last November, when we discussed the previous regulations which we are amending today, the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) said that his researchers believed that the cost per place of those pilots was likely to be about £1,300. Is that figure being borne out in practice? Is that the cost per job being secured by the pilots? How does the Minister hope to quantify the positive effect of the regulations on the progress of those pilots? Is there any evidence to date of success in the self-employment option through the new deal? Does the Lady know how many of those who started work under the self-employed option are still in work today? Naturally, we do not expect all new businesses to succeed, but perhaps there is some evidence as to what proportion are succeeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the reason for bringing forward new regulations now, four months to the day after the previous regulations, was that there had been extensive consultation. I am delighted that the Government are responding to that consultation. Are there any other matters arising from that consultation which the Government have considered, and in the light of which they plan to make further changes to regulations, or on which they have decided that it is not appropriate to act?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the work of the Prince's Trust. I am one of a number of hon. Members of all parties who had the great pleasure and privilege last summer of being invited by the Prince's Trust to see some of the work that is being done in my constituency by the Prince's Business Trust and the Prince's Youth Business Trust. It is very impressive, as I am sure that the Minister will agree. During that visit, I was told that the Prince's Trust—the umbrella organisation—was keen to take part in the work of the new deal. Indeed, I was told that one reason why the self-employed option under the new deal—the regulations in relation to which we are discussing as advanced was precisely because the Prince's Trust said that it wanted to bring under the umbrella of the new deal some of the activities that it was already undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Can the Minister tell us what has been the success of work with the Prince's Trust in new deal pilots? Can she tell us of lessons that have been learned from the work of the Prince's Trust?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 17 November, during consideration of the regulations that we are amending today, my right hon. Friend—sorry, my hon. Friend; although I am sure that it is only a matter of time before he is my right hon. Friend—my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) asked a number of questions, which were not then answered. Will the Minister clarify those matters this afternoon? Is there a clear business plan for the pilots? In particular, is there a clear means of assessing how and whether they are working?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the Government assess which self-employed jobs created under these or previous regulations would have been created anyway? There is always bound to be an element of dead weight and displacement. I remember from my time in the civil service that the Treasury was always keen to tell the Department of Employment that anything and everything that it wanted to do was just dead weight and would simply recreate what general economic activity would do. The Minister seems to acknowledge that, so I suspect that the Treasury vision has not changed since 1997 in that respect. What assessments have been made of displacement effects, and what evidence can the Minister give us of success in countering that argument?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the pilot in Bexley and Greenwich. According to the Library, that project is led by the local training and enterprise council. I am delighted to hear that the Minister has been listening to representations from that TEC; she cited TECs' wishes for flexibility as a reason why the regulations are before us. Has she been able to assess the impact in Bexley and Greenwich, or in other areas in which the TEC is leading the partnership, of the recent newspaper stories suggesting that the Government plan to abolish TECs entirely, or subsume them in some other project? It may not be the most effective means of encouraging the effective delivery of pilots to tell those providing them that they may be wound up entirely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be interested in what the Minister may be able to tell us about the prospective effects on self-employment of the £30 billion over five years in extra costs relating to higher taxes and greater regulation that the Government's policies are imposing on British business. What about the £250 million extra burden imposed on the self-employed by the alignment of their national insurance contributions with those of employees? We heard about that in the Chamber at Prime Minister's Question Time. The Prime Minister referred to corporation tax, but it must be said that very few self-employed people affected by the regulations pay corporation tax. I hope that the Minister can be a little more reassuring about the overall impact of Government policy on the self-employed sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, we are genuinely delighted that the Labour party has moved from its position during much of the 1980s and early 1990s of belittling self-employment as second best. We are delighted that they are introducing proposals deliberately to encourage self-employment and to encourage the unemployed to consider
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
self-employment as a possible, viable and strong option for their future. We very much hope that the strong growth in UK self-employment—the strongest growth in self-employment in Europe since 1979—will continue. That is occurring despite the vast burdens being imposed on small businesses in the self-employed sector by the Government, with their working time regulations, Employment Relations Bill and all the other paperwork and taxes that we frequently hear about, not least in letters from self-employed constituents. Consequently, we will be seeking to assess the effectiveness of the regulations in practice, and keeping a beady eye on how they work. They represent a rare step by this Government, which seems genuinely likely to aid and encourage the process of the growth of self-employment. On that basis, it will not be necessary for Conservative Members to divide the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should also like to say what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cunningham. I did not intend to say much, but I should like to mention a couple of points in response to the previous speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I hope that the Minister will respond to the issues that have been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon. Secondly, I speak as someone who has been self-employed. I had my own business under the previous Government, which unfortunately failed, in common with several thousand other small businesses. I know some of the problems that are involved in self-employment and running one's own business. I hope that the Government are not trying to reinvent the wheel. The hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr. Collins) mentioned the Prince's Trust. Anything that can be done at local level to support and work with the Prince's Trust, which has been doing such work for a long time and has an excellent record, would be welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister two Questions. Has she any estimates of the number of people who are expected to go into the self-employment market over the next 12 to 18 months? It would be interesting to hear the Government's view of the number of people that they would consider to constitute a success. Secondly, how will she assess the success of the scheme? What are the criteria on which she expects to judge the success of the various pilots? Will each of them have similar criteria to meet, or will they be allowed to self-assess their own success, as happens in other areas of the new deal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Broadly speaking, Liberal Democrat Members support the regulations, and we shall not wish to divide the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Committee's broad support for the regulations. The important thing about the new deal for the over-25s is that, unlike the new deal for 18 to 24-year-olds, it was not a manifesto commitment. Although I do not want to get into party political point-scoring in such an august Committee, the new deal for the over-25s is an attempt to improve the employability of people who slip through the available
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
chances of getting into employment, and have often spent many years unemployed as a result of some of the previous Government's policies. The new deal for the over-25s is aimed at trying to improve the employability of people in those circumstances. That is the primary aim of all the pilots that are going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new deal for the over-25s went nationwide in June, and is now available everywhere. The pilots, which were developed in November, are extra schemes with more flexibility. They were organised and provided by a mixture of different partnerships in local areas, which range from the purely private sector-led to various kinds of community partnerships, often involving TECS, as the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale said. This is a genuine experiment—we are trying to see what works best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Westmorland and Lonsdale and for Hereford (Mr. Keetch) asked how the schemes were progressing. I am afraid that I must disappoint both hon. Gentlemen, because it is much too early in the process to have any meaningful figures. The basic figures about the new deal for the over-25s do not relate directly enough to what is going on in the pilots. Normal evaluation procedures will be put in place, and we will publish results when meaningful results are available. At the moment, it is far too early for us to go into great detail about who is where and how successful the schemes have been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Collins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister says. However, it would be particularly helpful if she could give a specific commitment that when she publishes the results of the evaluation, one of the specific elements will be the cost per job created.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could spend all afternoon discussing how we would meaure that. For the new deal for lone parents in particular, Opposition Members divide the number of letters sent out by the number of people who have attended interviews, using the entire cost of the programme over the Parliament, which is £200 million, to give a cost of £36,000 per job. That is completely spurious mathematics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this point, when we have some agreement, I do not want to start bandying about figures and arguing about what is right. We will be doing independent, transparent and publishable evaluations; the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale must read them when they are published and form his opinions then. It does not help to produce figures for the cost per job which include all the start-up costs and a range of other expenditure for the entire Parliament when the pilots have been in existence for only a few months. That gives neither justifiable nor accurate figures. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be patient—as all Whips must learn to be—and await the proper evaluations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On how test trading has gone so far, we have done the most test trading in the new deal for 18 to 24-year-olds. I can tell hon. Members that in the first six months up to December last year, 1,587 people had undergone the basic awareness sessions, 986 people had undergone a short course or counselling on self-employment, and 391
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
were test trading. The scheme for the over-25s is slightly different and it is too early to say whether we can expect the same or a better rate of participation—one could argue for both outcomes with that different group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures for 18 to 24-year-olds demonstrate the demand for people to be allowed to try to get into self-employment. We must see what we can do with the benefit rules to remove the more obvious barriers; income-related and JSA benefits in particular interact to prevent people from being innovative and getting themselves out of unemployment. The regulations will remove some of those barriers in the 28 pilot areas. We must stand back and see whether there are any obvious policy pointers as to what we can do more generally to eliminate some of the difficulties in which the long-term unemployed find themselves when they try to better their circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for consultation, we got in touch with all the partnerships that had won the contracts to run the 28 pilots and asked them what other ideas they had about what would be effective. The point of the pilots is to encourage innovation and flexibility. The regulations are a response to the two most oft quoted items that the people running the pilots said would assist them in that. We are happy to be able to respond to those representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale mentioned dead weight in the Treasury. I can assure him that although some of the Treasury civil servants are still the same as when he was there, the Ministers have changed. While we take seriously the arguments about dead weight, we realise that there are other things that we
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
must do. We do not have the almost mythical belief, on which Ministers in the previous Administration seemed to rely, in the ability of the free market quickly to reach the pure equilibrium that theory tells us about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had no indication from any of the TECs involved in the pilots that they feel threatened by speculation about the future of TECS. Many TECs are enthusiastically engaging with the new regional agenda introduced under the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998. Such TECs are becoming actively involved with the regional development agencies and shadow boards in formulating economic development strategies for their areas. I have seen no indication to suggest that people feel at all threatened about the way in which TECs will evolve, although as a Minister in the Department of Social Security I have no direct responsibility for the future of TECS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations provide an opportunity for the Government to test on the ground whether we can take action on barriers to self-help, as well as to test the stage at which it is best to intervene in unemployment. We are trying out 12 months and 18 months to see which period is most effective. I shall consider the evaluation of the pilots with as keen an interest as Opposition Members, simply because we are anxious to learn from the innovations and flexibilities that the regulations will help us to put into the system. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
