	<div class='title'>RESTRICTION ON CORPORAL PUNISHMENT OF PUPILS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 2, line 17, leave out paragraph (b).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is really a probing amendment. Paragraph (b) sets out the conditions that a member of staff must fulfil to be able to use clause 1 as a defence. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the member of the staff believes on reasonable grounds that he is so shown in such a register."</p></blockquote>
It is important to establish what a member of staff has to do to show reasonable grounds. In the last resort, of course, it is a matter for the court to make a judgment, but it should be possible to avoid the point at which such a case is brought to the court, because it is an unpleasant business for the teacher and it is not particularly pleasant for anybody else. To avoid that, therefore, we need to have clear and specific rules—perhaps in the regulations—making clear what the member of staff has to do to show that he has reasonable grounds to believe that the child was on such a register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two sets of circumstances. In the last debate we pressed for corporal punishment to be carried out only by the head teacher, or on his instructions. At present, it is permissible by the head or other members of staff. Let us consider, first, the other members of staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the other members of staff ought physically to look at the register to see whether there is an entry there permitting that child to be subject to corporal punishment. If the teacher looks at the register and there is a mistake, the teacher should not be held liable; it should be the head or the authority responsible for compiling the register. If the teacher has done less than look at the register before he carries out the corporal punishment, in my view he is not carrying out the spirit of the clause. In a big school, he may telephone the school office and ask whether a certain child is on the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not satisfied with that. It is possible that the child was on the register last week, and the teacher relies on his memory. But we should remember that there are often clashes of name in large comprehensive schools, and it is difficult to be certain which Paul Jones it is. So the only reasonable ground in normal circumstances is that the teacher inspects the register to satisfy himself that the pupil's name is on it. The Minister should say that he accepts that view. In the regulations he should say that in normal circumstances the teacher should inspect the register and satisfy himself that the name is on it. That meets the requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be exceptional circumstances when that is not possible. As long as the regulations say "in exceptional circumstances", that narrow area can be tested in the court. The party may be away from school, or there may be difficulty in inspecting the register and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
teacher may have to rely on his memory. The Minister should make clear that the only way in which a member of staff can use this provision as his defence is if he has actually inspected the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the position is rather different for the head. He may appear before the court because he carried out the punishment wrongly. He does not have the defence that he simply inspected the register; he also has to establish that he carried out proper and due diligence in preparing the register. That is a different point, although, he ought to be able to clear up the first difficulty and say that he looked at the register. The allegation that the register was not properly maintained, and the question of whether the head or the local authority was responsible for it would be a second argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is far too general and vague an alibi for a member of staff to say that he "believes on reasonable grounds" that the child is shown on the register. I hope that the Minister will say that although he wants the Bill to include such a general provision, he accepts that the guidance to schools must contain a clear statement that the basic duty of a member of staff who wants to use the provisions in the clause is to examine the register and to satisfy himself that the name of the child whom he wishes to punish is on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg
	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Grantham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). The defence provided by paragraph (b) is clearly for the benefit of members of staff. I can conceive, circumstances where staff may have to act in emergencies or where they act on the recollection of what they last saw in the register. It must always be a question of fact whether they had reasonable grounds to hold the belief outlined in paragraph (b).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not seek to prescribe in regulation what material would constitute reasonable grounds. That matter is properly and exclusively for the courts. Moreoever, I do not believe that one can use regulations to curtail the courts interpretation of the phrase "reasonable grounds". It would be wrong to try and I urge the Minister not to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Young 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bolton, South-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I declared my interest at our last sitting. I have a little practical experience of classrooms. We are not discussing the rarefied atmosphere of the courts nor the quiet atmosphere of the director of education's room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I taught in London the 1950s, where there were none of the current problems. A colleague said, "The regulations are now so complex that if I cane a child and his parents complain, I may find myself in difficulty, not only with the authority but with the courts of law. Whether I am found guilty or not guilty, once I appear before the courts of law my career is finished. I will not jeopardise my family's prospects by being dragged before a court."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are assuming that the teacher has a complex administrative machine behind him. If the punishment is such that there is time to deal with it, it is right that all the administrative paraphernalia can be gone through. Hon. Members should put themselves in the place of a teacher who must act immediately, properly or in the absence of the head or other superior. The teacher knows that if he uses the cane he may be sued by the child's parents and his career will be finished. Hon. Members should go to one of the inner-city schools and take classes for about three months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The teacher has to choose between Johnny X and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0335">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
Johnny Y. If he teaches in a Welsh school he will have several pupils called Evans. In some inner-city schools, including mine in Bolton, there are many pupils called Patel. If the choice is between A and B and one chooses C, problems arise. We are entering the world of educational fantasy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hon. Gentleman doing less than justice to those teachers whom he knows and some of whom he represents? I should have thought that a competent teacher would take steps to see whether the Patel in his class is the same Patel on the register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I completely accept the hon. Gentleman's view. We now have a conflict between competent teachers and competent lawyers. The lawyer can, by nit-picking with the law if the parent asks for damages, sacrifice what seems to be a reasonable argument. If we were all lawyers or teachers, that might be more reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But let us not overlook the fact that we are creating a lawyers' bonanza. Any parent who feels disadvantaged can immediately ask his lawyer to satisfy his grievance and that is where the issue becomes practical nonsense. We must clarify in simple terms a guideline to safeguard teachers who have to impose this law, but it would be even better to declare the whole think nonsense and go against corporal punishment altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Humfrey Malins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) could help me on the phrase "reasonable grounds.". Something may be a reasonable ground to one teacher but not to another. Is the test subjective, and will every case be approached on the subjective or objective basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend accept that that is a matter for the courts? They will apply the test of what a reasonable minded teacher would feel or believe in the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Malins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point, but confusion could arise and there is a possibility of a lawyers' bonanza if teachers take different views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that a child was on the register and the parent asks for him to be removed from it. If the child were not removed because of an error at the school, is that likely to be negligence that gives rise to a cause for action by the parent against the person who should have removed the child's name from the register?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Flannery
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel as if I am trying to read something sensible from "Alice in Wonderland". This is a complex issue and the Bill is being debated in a different way from any Bill that I have ever debated—and I have been a member of many Standing Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally, the party opposing the Bill has a lot to say while those who are in favour of it and who want to get it over quickly sit quietly and say nothing. But in this Committee we are taking it in turn to speak, as if we were in a debating chamber. That means that there is utter confusion on the Conservative Benches because some hon. Gentlemen, although not admitting it, really agree with the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman intervenes constantly and so proves my point. Although most of his interventions are sympathetic and I welcome them, they are rather intrusive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman really must learn that Conservative Members are not in the least sympathetic to him. Conservative Members believe that their duties are twofold; one is to play an active and useful part in the debate, and the other is to raise questions that should be asked. We are positively sympathetic to the Bill, and we support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would be deeply worried if I were deeply sympathetic to him personally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Member return to the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I keep being led away from the amendment, but I wish to discuss this abstruse and difficult Bill and not have interventions made about my personal characteristics, which are obvious. Trying to interpret it is like reading "Alice through the Looking Glass" or "Alice in Wonderland"; it mirrors the utter confusion of its drafters. Indeed, when we consider the Bill and its amendments we wonder where in God's name we start—or finish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. We are on amendment No. 8. There has been a Second Reading debate and there will be a clause stand part debate. Perhaps he will confine his remarks to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am doing that, Mr. Morris, but I wish to establish that it is difficult to come to terms with the Bill, as it is so abstruse and confusing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers have a multiplicity of problems. I am thinking now of the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Mr. Young) and of the problem for teachers in knowing which Patel they are allowed to cane. That is the sort of dilemma which will be imposed on them by the Bill. In amendment No. 8 we are trying to rectify the difficulties that we—some of whom are very experienced teachers—know that other teachers will have to face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, there has been no consultation with those who will have to operate the Bill. If there had been, such nonsense could not have been perpetrated by the Government. Through the amendment we are trying to help teachers out of their difficulties. The Bill is bespattered with the essence of confusion because of its sheer unworkability. If there are to be two lists—or even one list—teachers will wonder what in heaven's name they are to do. They will be looking over their shoulders all the time—this is what amendment No. 8 is trying to remedy—and wondering, "Have I the right to cane this pupil?" or "Am I caning the correct Smith or Patel?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr, David Lightbown 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Staffordshire, South-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Having heard his vigorous defence of the teaching
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
profession, I believe that the clause will protect teachers from vexatious litigation if they make a genuine error.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, but when the hon. Gentleman refers to vexatious litigation he is admitting, in effect, that a teacher who wonders how to carry out honourably what the Bill empowers hm to do will also have to bear in mind the fact that he may land up in court. Our amendments are an attempt to protect teachers from the provisions in the Bill; we know that their task is hard enough anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1(5) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this section, a pupil is exempt from corporal punishment by a member of the staff except at a time when .. . (a) the member of the staff believes on reasonable grounds that he is so shown in such a register."</p></blockquote>
It is more than likely that, with all the good intentions in the world, the teacher involved will not be sure "on reasonable ground", so it is necessary to try to interpret the meaning of the phrase. But the imagination boggles at such a prospect, and at trying to discover what "reasonable", or "unreasonable", means. It would be a lawyer's paradise in trying to decide what the poor teacher with a cane had done to a pupil who may have been innocent, and who may be the wrong person. The teacher faces a dilemma. He may hate having to do it, realise that there is a law in the background and wonder whether he is doing what is right. If the matter came to court, the phrase "on reasonable grounds" would give lawyers a field day. I see that Conservative Members agree with me. Teachers are always worried about the punishments given to a child, even if, like me, they do not believe in corporal punishment. They fear the consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents complain to me because a child stays behind for five minutes to move chairs for me. A mother waiting outside junior schools asks, "Where's Robert?". When I reply that he is moving chairs, she says, "I thought you were punishing him" so I have to explain. All teachers face that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are deeply worried by expressions such as "on reasonable grounds" and a teacher will be worried about whether he is punishing the right child, and which register is which. It is not unreasonable for teachers to be worried about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reinforce the hon. Gentleman's defence of the teaching profession and support him. It is not unreasonable that when a teacher knows the profile and detail of his pupils, he should not keep a simple record within the confines of his classrom. The argument that it is an administrative jungle is demeaning to the teaching profession. They are sensible, intelligent people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for misinterpreting what the hon. Gentleman wanted to do. I agree that it is an imposition on teachers that they need worry about the matter. They will resent deeply the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science (Mr. Bob Dunn)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply to the short debate on amendment No. 8. The Committee knows that clause 1(5) (b) is intended to protect a teacher who in good faith uses corporal punishment on an exempt child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1(5) (a) will protect a teacher if a wrong entry is made in the register. I tell my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North-West (Mr. Malins) that the teacher can
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
rely on the entry. But if the register has been completed in a slip-shod or incorrect way, there may be a case for pursuing the body responsible in the civil court. My hon. Friend knows from reading the notes on clauses that either the governing body or the local education authority is the body responsible, depending on the status of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1(5) (b) offers protection to teachers who make a genuine mistake of identity, after taking reasonable steps to familiarise themselves with the contents of a register, but, because of an oversight in the established routine of the school, are unaware of a change of entry. I welcome the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, South-East (Mr. Lightbown) who, I believe, supports the aim of this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) (b) refers to a member of staff who "believes on reasonable grounds" that a pupil is shown as liable to corporal punishment. It is right that the Committee should ask what is meant by "believes on reasonable grounds". There are two elements in the clause with the Committee will accept. The first relates to the member of staff's belief. He has to believe that a child's name is on the register as a pupil liable to corporal punishment. He cannot just assume it or not bother; he must believe it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second element relates to the grounds upon which the belief rests. They have to be reasonable. If the teacher has taken steps to familiarise himself with the contents of the register, by checking it once or twice a week or as many times as is practicable, or there is a well-run system for notifying teachers of changes to the register, the familiarisation or the system would in themselves provide the grounds for the belief that a pupil was liable to corporal punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clement Freud 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridgeshire, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain whether that is the defence which the teacher will bring to court or is that what will stop him appearing in court?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: From earlier exchanges, the hon. Gentleman will know that what is reasonable is a matter for definition by the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Freud</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He will be brought to court, and that will be his defence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will go that far, in that sense. Let us look at some examples. Let us say that a teacher is away from school for a lengthy period, perhaps for as long as six months, due to illness, secondment, in-service training or for any other reason. On return to the school, the teacher does not bother to look at the register but uses corporal punishment on an exempt child. The courts would almost certainly take the view that such an action was not founded on a belief of any kind, particularly if the pupil involved had joined the school within the six month period when the teacher was away from school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take another example of a teacher who wishes to punish a pupil who says that he is John Smith. That might happen in a very large school. The teacher checks the register and finds that John Smith is liable to corporal punishment. The teacher subsequently canes the alleged John Smith. If it then turns out that the pupil involved in the misdemeanour was Alan Smith, who was trying to evade responsibility for his misdemeanour, the courts would probably rule that the teacher had reasonable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
grounds for belief that the pupil concerned was liable to corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A third example might be one of a teacher who takes over a class at short notice. The normal class teacher might say, in handing over the class, "No one is exempt from corporal punishment." In the first few minutes, a flagrant act of indiscipline occurs and the temporary teacher reacts by smacking a child who turns out to be exempt. In that case, I believe that the courts could say that the temporary teacher had reasonable grounds for believing that the pupil was liable to corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question about reasonable grounds has been raised. The concept of reasonableness, as was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg), is an objective one which the courts regularly adopt. A teacher has reasonable grounds only if his grounds are such that it would lead a responsible and sensible teacher to believe that the pupil was shown on the register as liable to corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member referred to regulations. I do not advise that we seek to put such guidelines in regulations. There are other means, such as departmental circulars which could adequately state and provide some guidelines, although my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham will be first to point out that such a circular could not be authoritative as such a prescription is a matter for the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) raised the question of consulting registers. I believe that he accepts that practice would vary from the small primary or village school to the very large urban comprehensive, where as many as 100 pupils may start at the school in the September term. To consult the register might be feasible in formal cases of caning. In our debates last Wednesday the Committee agreed that in many schools there was a procedure and a punishment book and that a certain mechanical operation took place when a person was sent for punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Smacks are different, as we accept. They may necessarily be applied immediately once an offence has been noticed and the immediate response will be welcomed in certain cases, in certain classrooms by certain children. I am glad to note that the hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East (Mr. Freud) is nodding vigorously at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that a smack needs to be administered as quickly as possible if it is to have any effect, and all the Bill asks is that the teacher should act reasonably. I accept that teachers who use corporal punishment in circumstances other than those involving immediate danger to persons or property need to be circumspect. That point was made by my hon. Friend the member for Staffordshire, South-East. They should not use it on pupils they do not know without first checking the register. Forgetfulness or carelessness on their own are insufficient excuses for using corporal punishment on exempt pupils.

the courts. I am glad to note that the Conservative party is now so enthusiastic about the courts in view of the comments made by some of its members earlier in the week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it well worth avoiding the courts. I realise that the hon. Member for Grantham has an interest in encouraging people to go to court as frequently as possible, but I should have thought that our advice to teachers and parents should be to stay away from the courts as far as possible. Therefore, we should give guidance to teachers and parents which, as far as possible, eliminates doubt and makes clear where the law stands. It may be that we shall need a little catch-all phrase which leaves the marginal cases to come to the courts, but I had hoped that the Minister would have told us that he would give clear guidance. I suggested giving it in the regulations, and in his reply he suggested that perhaps there could be a departmental circular. I press him to think carefully about the proposition that the easiest way will be to say to teachers, "You are on safe ground. The departmental advice is that if you will look at the register before you administer corporal punishment, then, clearly, you will be administering it on reasonable grounds in the belief that you are entitled to do so" . That would be absolutely clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not go that far, we shall enter circumstances which might end in the courts and, possibly, a court might come to a decision that was unfavourable to teachers. Therefore, I should have thought that it was desirable to provide as clear guidance as possible to teachers and parents and to lawyers who may advise parents. A lawyer might advise a parent, "The teacher looked at the register and the name was in it, so it would be totally wrong for you to take action against him. Your complaint must be that the register was not compiled properly. Therefore, your action should be against the local authority".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The implication in the words "on reasonable grounds" is nebulous, although I know that the phrase is used a great deal in law. In the past, a large number of people were hanged "on reasonable grounds". The interpretation of those three words is so vast that the most dreadful things may be done on what are known as reasonable grounds. Therefore, the use of that expression is of such immense ambiguity, or even worse, that as reasonable people we must question allowing it to pass without debate or question because we would be wrong to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am not saying that they should take it out of the clause, because I said at the beginning that the amendment was merely a probe. It should be done by putting into the regulations that, at least on the part of the Government, certain steps should be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was rather vague in his reply. He gave us lots of "ifs" and "buts" and then said that it would be up to the courts to decide. I accept that, ultimately, it will be up to the courts to decide, but most teachers and parents want some clear guidance at least. Until there have been a few test cases it will be difficult to use the courts to give indications.

The hon. Gentleman is right to focus on the essential role of the courts in this matter. The definition of reasonableness is for the courts to decide. The hon.

Indeed, there was a case involving my local authority in Kent and a local parent in the mid-1950s.

I am reluctant to put the matter into regulations and I suspect that I could not devise any that would satisfy the rapacious charms of the hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make clear to the Committee that I do not intend to speak to amendment No. 13 or
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
press it to a vote because I believe that it is defective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three proposals in this group of amendments. The first is that pupils over the age of 16 should be liable to corporal punishment only with their consent. We suggest that the position should be the same for England as that proposed by the Government of Scotland. It would be logical to impose the same rules in respect of corporal punishment in England and Scotland. I hope that the Committee will at least agree to that. It is crazy to say that in Scotland the pupil's consent must be obtained but not in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, I believe that pupils give consent because the majority of those over 16 are at school voluntarily, although there is a problem with those who have reached the age of 16 and intend to leave at the end of the year but have not yet done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second proposal is that corporal punishment should not be used on pupils over 16. If a teacher is trying to instil the principles of self discipline, the use of force and violence against pupils of that age group presents vast problems. From my experience of talking to teachers and head teachers, very few of them would contemplate using corporal punishment on that age group. In many instances it leads to escalation of confrontation rather than the solution of problems. If corporal punishment is used on that age group and a pupil is hurt, there is a good chance that someone will lose his temper. The pupil may be larger than the member of staff and such punishment may produce a fight, which would cause worse problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The teacher can use the cane.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problems certainly escalate, and that results in pupils being suspended. So I feel that there is a strong argument for saying that, even though pupils may consent, it is far better not to subject anyone over age 16 to corporal punishment, although I admit that the Opposition have argued against corporal punishment for anyone. We feel that age 14, which our amendment seeks to substitute, is more realistic, and takes into account the possible size of a pupil and the educational objective of trying to get pupils to exercise self-discipline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We put three suggestions to the Government. The first, which I hope they accept without hesitation, is that the law for England ought to be the same as the law in Scotland. If they accept that, I ask them to go a little further for England and for Scotland and agree that no one over age 16 should be subjected to corporal punishment. If they were prepared to agree to that and to say that perhaps 14 is the age at which often the pupil is physically, at least, as large as the teacher and in educational terms that they want the youngster to be able to exercise self-discipline rather than have discipline imposed by force, that would be helpful. I look for at least some concessions from the Government in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it relevant and important that the Education Act 1944 specifies 14 as the mandatory age limit, but does not cover those aged 16-plus, which means that there are other courses open to the teachers to deal with pupils aged 16-plus which they cannot take with 14-year olds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'> Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I do not want to labour the point. I propose that it should be voluntary after 16 years, so as to make the law in England the same as in Scotland. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that after age 16 the pupil has a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
choice about whether to stay at the school because education is no longer compulsory. Those are logical grounds when compared with Scotland and when related to the legal staying-on age. Then, considering the physical problems of corporal punishment and educational objectives, age 14 is more logical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am giving the Goverment three alternatives and suggesting that the ideal one is to come down to 14. If they are not prepared to go that far, I ask them to look sympathetically at age 16, because of the implications of the compulsory staying-on age and the physical problems. If they will not come to that, I ask them at least to go as far as the Scottish proposals and provide that it be only with the pupil's consent, because it seems crazy to have one set of regulations for Scotland and a different set for England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Key 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Salisbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill as it stands discriminates against young people aged between 16 and 18 in England and Wales by comparison with their peers in Scotland. While it is true that Scottish education law has progressed further and faster than that of England and Wales in giving young people in this age group independent rights to choice and self-determination, there are good legal as well as common sense justifications for extending these rights to under-18s south of the Border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 8 of the Family Law Reform Act 1969 gives young people of 16 and over independent rights to consent to, or refuse, medical treatment. In the recent Court of Appeal decision in the Gillick case, their lordships confirmed that the age of discretion has been taken as 16 for girls, and 14 for boys, in a succession of celebrated cases. Even in the Education Act 1944, which applies to England and Wales, there is at least one provision which transfers parents' rights to young people at 16. It is section 50, which relates to the provision of board and lodging for pupils. Section 50(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In making any arrangements under this secion for any pupil" "or young person, a local education authority shall, so far as practicable, give effect to the wishes of the parent of the pupil" "or to the wishes of the young person, as the case may be . . ."</p></blockquote>
It places a duty on local education authorities to respect the wishes of parents or young people with regard, in this case, to the religious denominations of the person with whom they reside. More recently, the Department of Education and Science has encouraged local education authorities in schools to take
	<br><blockquote><p>"the feelings and perceptions of the child"</p></blockquote>
into account in its circular 1/82 on the Education Act 1981. The main provisions of this Bill will inevitably create injustices between pupils who are exempt and pupils who are not in schools which continue to use corporal punishment and the purpose of my amendment, like that of the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), is to remove another entirely unnecessary injustice and distinction between English and Welsh young people on the one hand and Scottish young people on the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also support amendment No. 68. I was fascinated to read in the press recently that a young man of 16 got married. Who would cane him after that? I do not know. The permutations and combinations of sheer stupidity flowing from almost every line and class of the Bill make the imagination boggle. That we can regard young people of 16 as adults—indeed, that is the situation today—that they can get married with all that that involves, and that it is possible to give them a beating shows such sheer backwardness on the part of the establishment which thought out the Bill that we really must consider its provisions with very great care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the grammar school I attended, I was taught by those who were called the Christian Brothers—I do not adhere to their belief any longer—and the head of our school was called Brother Columba. "Columba", so my Latin text tells me, means a dove—peace. I recall that that, as a prefect at the age of 16 coming back to school at lunchtime having been playing football, I was entering the precincts of the building around which there was a sloping grass verge, roped off to make it look pretty. Some lower form pupils had been playing ball, and the ball had gone over the road onto the grass. One of the boys called to me to get the ball for them, so with all the authority of a prefect I stepped over the rope and retrieved the ball. Brother Columba, our head, was passing at the time—he was a formalist par excellence—and he said to me, "Martin, I want to speak to you." He was Irish, and he took me over and spoke to me--[Hon. Members: "With a stick."] . They used a tawse at that school, not the cane—that was the English method. In the Celtic areas they used the tawse. Having argued that I should never have done that, he proceeded to give me six of the best with the tawse. I was 16. I was tall and reasonably strong. Whatever stopped me dealing with Brother Columba as I think any human being being subjected to common assault in that way should have dealt with him I shall never quite know, but I admire my own restraint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

before, that he was doing something which was utterly wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone did that outside the school, he would be accused of common assault. According to the Bill, one can attack a pupil with a cane or a tawse in a school and get away with it, but outside one would be subject to a proper law for assault. Having spent my whole life in education and having spent the last two days talking to educationalists, although only briefly about the Bill, I still cannot relate attacks on young people of 16 to the opening of any of the channels of learning. That is why my hon. Friends and I think that we ought to do something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that in Scotland young people of 16 and over can make their own decison about this, so the situation in England will be in direct conflict with that to the north. There was a time when the English used to regard people up there as savages, but it seems that educationally they are miles ahead of us in this respect—unless being ahead in English now means being backward, because that is what is happening.

I wish to pay a tribute to Conservative Members. I have done so several times in the past few days, so I must examine my conscience. Educated as most of them are, I do not think that they really believe what the Government are suggesting here.

Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mr. Flannery). Many of us will understand his anecdotes and I should place on record our appreciation of his sincere interpretation of education policy. Without him, our cause would be much more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an interesting group of amendments, because it seeks to bring the provisions of the Bill relating to England and Wales into line with the provisions in Scotland. If I comment on the differences between the position in England and Wales and that in Scotland I am sure that the Committee will bear with me for a few moments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legal position of parents and young people over the age of 16 is different south of the border. In England and Wales young people under the age of 18 are in the care and control of their parents, and it would be wrong to interfere with that position in one aspect and one aspect alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland the position is different. The concept of a young person has been included in Scottish legislation on education since at least 1908. The common law of Scotland recognises three basic distinctions of natural
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
persons—pupils, minors and adults. Although a person at age 16 is still a minor, his position obviously changes since he can, for example, get married and is entitled to set up a home on his own. In particular the courts will always allow him a right of audience in any matters affecting his personal position. Accordingly, he must be treated as having a different status. For these reasons the education legislation in Scotland takes particular account of the position of a minor who has reached the age of 16. For example, in relation to placing requests under section 28A of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 there are different mechanisms and a different set of principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must therefore, resist the temptation to equate matters north of the border with those south of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the principle of whether those aged 16 to 18 should be subject to corporal punishment at all, I cannot go along with those who would wish to enforce a ban. There are many circumstances in which a 16 or 17-year-old may deserve and ought to receive corporal punishment. If his parents believe that he—or she, but mainly he—should be liable to that punishment, and the school believes that it is appropriate, why should we as a House, as a Committee or as a Government, seek to stop them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Amendment No. 63 would mean the abolition of corporal punishment for all pupils within the scope of the Bill who are between 16 and 18 years of age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 61 would have the effect of providing that pupils aged between 14 and 18 can exempt themselves from corporal punishment. Wherever possible we must seek a uniform position for pupils in receipt of compulsory education and for those who elect to stay on at school until 18. I myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) have followed that theme consistently. We must constantly resist the temptation to carve things up and make separate compartments for different categories of pupil.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment deals with the younger age group—children under the age of five. Here we are looking at practicalities and again discussing educational theory. I believe that smacking—or, indeed, any corporal punishment—is totally inappropriate for children below the age of five. In the vast majority of schools no one would contemplate maintaining a register because the mechanics of it would be so bureaucratic, particularly in nursery schools, and it would be far better not to get involved in registers or in corporal punishment for any child under the age of five.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seems determined to pilot the Bill through without amendment, so I am not hopeful of getting changes made. Nevertheless, he should consider the practicalities. Trying to maintain a register for children in that age group, where education is not compulsory, will be extremely cumbersome. The principle is to encourage children to enjoy coming to school, so punishments at that age should be kept to a minimum. It is a pretty incompetent teacher who cannot control a three or fouryear-old with words rather than with physical action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) will not persuade my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State. I am not prepared to say that as a matter of principle it is always wrong to slap a child under the age of five. I can envisage circumstances where it would be far from wrong to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a school's governors are persuaded by arguments such as those of the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, they need not maintain a register. If the governors maintain a register and parents are persuaded by the hon. Gentleman's arguments, the parents can opt their children out of the system. The Opposition's arguments are of no merit and I hope that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State will not accede to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to respond immediately to the request of my hon. Friend the Member for Granthan (Mr. Hogg). I shall not give way on the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to restrict the range of pupils liable to corporal punishment so that even if the school and the parents agreed about the use of corporal punishment their joint view would be overridden by an enforced ban. The amendments would mean that moderate and reasonable corporal punishment could not be used on under-fives. The intention of the amendments is to ban corporal punishment in any and every form in maintained nursery schools and nursery classes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would indeed be divisive. There are rising 5s in our infant and primary systems and there would be mixed punishments in the same schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Bill's intention is to respond to the discipline of the European Court, I shall resist any attempts to remove parents' rights to decide what is best for their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the amendments, the slap on the leg, the smack on the hand would be prohibited acts just as much as the use of the cane for older age groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that staff who teach and supervise under fives need to exercise some care. Any smacks should be moderate and reasonable in relation to that age group. I am not advocating or anticipating undue physical force,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
but I cannot accept that central Government should seek to force teachers to abandon corporal punishment for this or any other group of pupils. After all, it is the parents and the teachers who, together, know these children best, and if the parents believe that their children should not be liable to corporal punishment, the Bill gives them the absolute right to claim an exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a parent with two small boys, I know that children under 5 can sometimes behave very badly. Teachers, like parents, must be in a position to react reasonably to such behaviour as they think fit. I hope that the Committee will agree with this line of reasoning and resist the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not expect much better from the Minister, but I am disappointed. He does not think about practicalities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe in corporal punishment, but if it is to be administered in schools for this age group, it must be quick and a response to a particular misdemeanour. Then, the register would be difficult to use. The teacher must know whether a child is on the register. In the short time when a teacher is considering how to check whether the child is on the register and what punishment would be appropriate, the child may feel a sense of injustice. Children of that age have strong views about injustice. If two small children both tip the sand out of the sand tray into the teacher's handbag, or get into some other sort of mischief that does not please the teacher, and one of them gets a small smack while the other is merely shouted at, that would cause resentment. I suspect that the practicalities will make the register extremely difficult to implement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another principle is also involved. It concerns how the register will be compiled. I hope that a parent's decision on whether to allow his child to be corporally punished will be separated from the admission procedure. I can see that it would be simple for the headmaster to say, "You are signing on at this school. Here is the form—and you do approve of corporal punishment, don't you?" The signature would be obtained there and then and the decision on corporal punishment would have been taken. If it is done in that way it will be possible for some head teachers to pressurise parents into making that decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is outrageous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are teachers who believe in corporal punishment—otherwise we would not have it. Teachers will say to the parents, "Of course you believe in it." Where there is competition to get into a primary school, parents may feel that if they do not agree with the head teacher's philosophy and he has to choose between admitting pupil A or pupil B their child may lose out. Perhaps those are justified grounds for a head teacher making such a decision, but that would be an unfortunate area to get into. That is why it is important to separate the decision on whether a parent will allow his child to go on the register from the act of enrolment or registration for school. As the regulations are set out, there is a waiting period of 42 days before one knows whether the child is on the register. In that short period the child will not be on the register, so the Government are effectively abolishing the register for that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will tell us that one can go through the procedure of compiling the register before the child is
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
admitted to the school, but that will allow the odd head who has strong views to put undue pressure on parents. I can see that it is tempting for a head who believes in corporal punishment and does not believe in the Government's approach of having one group of children subject to corporal punishment and another not subject to it saying to the parent, "It would be much easier if we could apply corporal punishment to all children" and thus applying pressure on the parents. Although we may not think that that is good practice, it is not outlawed by the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been helpful if the Minister had said that we shall not have corporal punishment until a child reaches the age of five and at that stage, the school can, if it so wishes, start to compile the register. I do not expect that the Minister has changed his mind, but he may wish to say a few more words. In any event, I wish to make it clear to you, Mr. Morris, that the Opposition would like to vote on the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply to the hon. Gentleman in this way. How teachers react when a child who may receive corporal punishment behaves badly is a matter for them. We cannot keep embracing the concept of the nanny state where every circumstance and condition under which a teacher may apply a punishment is laid down in a prescriptive form. That would not be possible; it would be difficult and it would be unwelcome if we attempted to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is entering marshy ground when he suggests that the local authority should lay down in the admission procedures whether a school applies corporal punishment. What we propose is not marshy territory. But it would indeed be a lawyers' paradise if parents complain that they did not know that their child's school was one where corporal punishment was liable to be employed, and that had they known that they may not have sent him there in the first place. What the amendment seeks is, on the one hand, the nanny state, and on the other the ending of certain information that is now available to prospective parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that the school should not put the information in its prospectus. But it would be unfortunate if, when a parent puts down his child's name one or even two years before his admission to the school—as happens in some areas—or even on the day that he is admitted, the head teacher were to say, "Make your choice now."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can put the hon. Gentleman out of his misery. We believe that the question of the sort that he has framed will be put to parents after their child has been accepted for a school. Again, no doubt the hon. Gentleman realises that parents can elect to change their minds. If there is the sort of pressure mentioned by him—which I would regret—and the head teacher has a bias towards corporal punishment, which figures only informally in the child's assessment and acceptance procedures, the parents will still have the opportunity, after the start of the September term, to change their minds about the matter, and to give notice to the school to that effect. I believe that the picture painted by the hon. Gentleman is neither fair nor reasonable, and I hope that he will not press the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

But I disassociate myself from these amendments. If, in the case of younger children, mild corporal punishment such as a smack is given—I have great faith in the nursery and primary school sector—I feel that even the child who has not reached the age of reason will understand what that smack is for.

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of amendments Nos. 10, 11 and 14 is to probe the Government about independent schools in England and Wales while amendments Nos. 40 and 41 are, I hope, parallel amendments in respect of Scotland. The first three amendments would cover all independent schools in England and Wales, and the other two would do the same for those in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should tell us why they believe that independent schools do not come within the scope of article 2 of protocol. 1 if parents are paying fees. The article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the exercise of any functions which it assumes in relation to education and to teaching, the State shall respect . . . parents' philosophical convictions."</p></blockquote>
The register should apply to all schools. The Government inspect independent schools regularly. It is an offence not to be registered. Therefore, it is logical that the legislation should extend to all schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
The Government, quite rightly, said that the legislation should apply to all state schools. It should apply to schools with assisted places for which the Government provide some of the money. I would question whether it should also apply to those pupils whose education is paid because their parents are in the diplomatic corps or the armed forces. When the Government finance education in that way, it is illogical to treat that separately from the assisted places scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the Minister believe that article 2 of protocol 1 does not apply to independent schools when it applies to the rest of the school system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subsections in the Bill respond to the need to bring within its scope pupils at independent schools in which public funds are directly involved. The Committee knows that that need springs from the European Convention on Human Rights. It places certain obligations on member states, as recognised by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, but only with regard to functions assumed by the state. In the context of education, when the state has accepted the function of assisting the education of a pupil it must exercise that function in accordance with the convention. If it has not accepted that function—in the United Kingdom that covers the vast majority of pupils at independent schools—there is no similar obligation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the whole idea of inspecting independent schools and registering them was to ensure that the standards of education provided were adequate. The Government take an interest in the standards of independent schools so article 2 of protocol 1 should apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Independent schools are subject to inspection, but responsibility for what takes place in those schools is a matter for the proprietors or the charitable trust which administers the school. Parents who send their children to fee-paying schools elect to do so with their own money. Therefore, those children are not taking a place in the maintained system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cannot brush this aside. Although it is rare, it is possible for the Secretary of State to remove registration if he is not satisfied that minimum standards are maintained. The Secretary of State may not impose high standards on those schools, but he does impose minimum standards, so the protocol should apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference between us is small. The hon. Gentleman paints a picture which I recognise, but he knows that some parents wish to educate their children in a sector for which the state has no responsibility, except in the sense that he outlined. Those parents have the alternative of sending their children to state schools. The convention places no obligation on the independent sector except where children are in those schools under the assisted places scheme and have been paid for with public money. The hon. Gentleman knows that and I know that, so he must accept my explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not, because the same point applies to the assisted places scheme. The parent has the choice of whether or not to participate. If the Minister's defence is that parents do not need to send their children to an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0344">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
independent school, I accept that, but there are circumstances in which, because of the special educational problems of their family, the parents may not have much choice. It would be better if a wider choice of schools were offered within the state sector. It is difficult for the Minister to say, "Look, we can exclude independent schools because the parent has a choice but we have to include assisted places schools because the parent also has a choice."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reads the subsections again, he will find therein the answer that he seeks. We should all pursue the holy grail, and that should be his task for the day. When I see the hon. Gentleman again in a week's time he will tell me that he understands the purpose of the subsections, because they answer his points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may range wider than the amendment, the hon. Gentleman knows that there is nothing to stop an independent school from taking the same position as a school in the maintained sector and saying, "This school no longer wishes to apply corporal punishment." But we have given to parents of children who go to schools in the independent sector the same rights as parents in the maintained sector—the right to say that they wish their child to be exempted from corporal punishment. I suspect that the hon. Member seeks, through the amendments, to broaden the Bill as much as possible so as to give exemption rights to as many parents as possible. Now that he has probed far enough, I trust that the hon. gentleman will agree that his amendments widen, rather than narrow, the scope of the Bill. I hope that as a result of that, and of my advice to him, he will seek leave to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not convinced me. I hope that the Government do not eventually have to take the matter back to the European Court for a judgment because I suspect that the Minister would be on very dodgy ground. However, I need not detain the Committee further because the better independent schools have already abolished corporal punishment and there is probably as rapid a move in most of them to get rid of it as there is in the vast majority of state schools. On that basis, I shall not press the amendments to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The scope of the Bill covers pupils whose education is being provided other than at school by local education authorities but it does not appear to cover the considerable number of pupils whose education is being provided elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many institutions in which teachers and others are employed by the social services, health authorities and other organisations but which are not schools as such. That may include education at community homes, with education on the premises, observation and assessment centres, intermediate treatment centres and a variety of small private and voluntary children's homes, residential care homes, nursing and mental nursing homes, and so on. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Bill's provisions cover pupils at all such institutions as clearly they come within the scope of the European Court judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the organisations which is very worried about this aspect of the Bill is the London Boroughs Children's Regional Planning Committee. It has pointed out that although some of the children will be covered by other regulations concerning children's homes, there are others who do not have even that degree of protection. Even those who are covered by the children's homes regulations would not be protected in the way that is envisaged in the Bill. There is a danger that there could be one standard for children in care who attend a local authority school and a different standard for children in care receiving education provided by the social services in a community home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three major groups of establishments seem to fall outside the definition of the Bill. The first group is made up of local authority children's homes including community homes with education and observation and assessment centres where education is provided on the premises by the social services authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second major group is made up of independent and voluntary homes where education is provided on the premises by the organisation and where the number of children receiving education does not require registration as a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third group is made up of homes registered under the Registered Homes Act 1984 for mentally and physically handicapped children who may be placed by social services authorities and where the education is provided by the organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These apparent anomalies in the protection, or lack of protection, afforded to different categories of children are of particular concern as they seem to leave the more vulnerable children in care in a less advantageous position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find my hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment and those grouped with it. It seems important that the same rules should apply, as far as possible, across the board and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
that where education is being provided by a local authority, in a community home or anywhere else, the same regulations should apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to accept in regard to a children's home in the non-educational provision, that it is up to the social services department to apply its own rules. As I understand it, the vast majority of social services departments have made it quite clear that corporal punishment is unacceptable to them, whatever the circumstances, in children's homes, community homes and so on. However, there is a problem in regard to the education provision. On some occasions the staff are employed by an education authority and sometimes by a social services department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that there will be problems in trying to include all the different types of specialist social services provision where education is a part, but I still think that the Government could have designed a set of amendments that included all of them, and in logic and fairness they should do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the cheerfulness and amiability for which I am justly famous, I must say that I find myself, reluctantly, in the position of being Father Christmas, but not, I fear, to the hon.

Therefore, in my view it would be inappropriate in a Bill defining an exemption scheme for institutions acting under education legislation to attempt to encompass other types of institutions.

I should like to deal with amendment No. 67, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key).

Basically, such schools are outside his control but he can say to them, "Because you are providing education, we insist that you comply with our regulations on corporal punishment". Yet, where a social services department is responsible for social service provision which includes education, he is not prepared to impose on that.

I have tried to help the Committee on several occasions by taking up points that have been raised, but I cannot assist the hon. Gentleman any further on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 67 which was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury. I wish to speak
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
about a difficulty presented by this part of the Bill and the amendment, although there may be some light for my hon. Friend when I have finished speaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements between local education authorities and voluntary organisations vary considerably and there is no ready way of bringing those arrangements within the Bill. I believe the Committee will accept that if the Bill refers simply to "special arrangements" there will be uncertainty. Ideally, I would like the Bill to cover all the circumstances in which a local education authority has a deciding voice. For example, if a local education authority regularly uses a voluntary organisation to take a significant proportion of truanting or disruptive pupils, I would like to extend the arrangements to those pupils. However, my hon. Friend must accept that, as he knows, there are drafting and practical difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A local education authority may use a voluntary group that offers outdoor or residential experience. To talk of registers in those circumstances and the sending out of forms canvassing parental views would cause immense difficulties, both in the presentation and collation of information. How does one identify in law who should keep a corporal punishment register in such cases, bearing in mind that the arrangements with the voluntary group may be temporary? How does one distinguish between that sort of case and the more structured arrangements under which pupils are sent to long-established units?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that amendments Nos. 15, 16, 42 and 43 are defective and that the only way of dealing with the principle that we wish to set out is to use new clause 2. For the purposes of the debate I move amendment No. 15, but we shall not expect the Minister to reply to amendments Nos. 15, 16, 42 and 43. If we are dissatisfied with the Minister's reply to new clause 2, as I suspect we shall be, we shall probably wish to vote on the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he made a concession on the last group of amendments. I hope that he did, and that he was not considering the arithmetic of the Committee and deciding that he might not be able to carry it off, thinking that it was far better to wait until Report, when he could drag Members in to listen to the debate, and so would not have to convince them. We shall judge that at the appropriate point on Report, but I hope that he has made a genuine concession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to a question on which we touched briefly before, which is, who should be allowed to administer corporal punishment? I believe strongly that if it is to be administered, it must be administered only by qualified teachers. In our previous debate, I said that I was extremely worried about ancillary workers employed in schools being allowed to administer it. The hon. Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) had enthusiasm for the carpentry chappie, and all sorts of other people were dragged in. I feel that if a school is to be well run, only a qualified teacher should carry out the task. I am willing to accept the Minister's query about whether two years' or three years' experience is reasonable, but I do not think that a probationer or an unqualified person should administer corporal punishment, because it would be bad practice. Therefore, it is reasonable to ask the Minister to put that fact in the Bill so that there can be no argument or doubt, and so that it can be seen than the Minister agrees with it although, of course, the vast majority of local education authorities and schools would make it clear themselves that they did not expect anyone other than a qualified person to administer corporal punishment. If the Minister cannot accept the wording of new clause 2, I hope that on Report he will say that he agrees that the only people who should administer corporal punishment are qualified teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State does not go as far as the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) has asked. In last week's debate, I expressed anxiety about the interpretative subsection (8). In its present form, potentially it includes everyone employed on the school premises. That is too wide, and it is undesirable. I suggested at our last sitting that it should be confined to teachers, but I was persuaded that that was too narrow a view and that it should extend to everyone in loco parentis, that is to say, to everyone who has genuine responsibility for the pupil at any one time. I should like that to be put in the Bill. I can see drafting difficulties, but they are not insuperable. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider that proposition. I shall be sorry if he accepts the suggestion that the power to administer corporal punishment be confined to teachers with more than three years' experience, because that would be undesirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that I am living through a
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
nightmare. It is almost unbelievable that adults should be saying that anyone with responsibility for children should be able to administer corporal punishment in 1985. It proves that some people should be back in the 17th century. We have tried to introduce a little common sense in new clause 2, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Only qualified teachers of three or more years' experience may administer corporal punishment to pupils."</p></blockquote>
When corporal punishment is administered in a school, the people administering it have usually become frustrated, angry and upset. The law is violated daily in most British schools, with punishment being given in front of children. Most of them will never receive it, because they are so terrified of it that they will try to avoid it, feeling that they have done nothing wrong anyway. Yet the suggestion of the hon. Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg)—I hope that he will be able to correct me, because I want to be wrong in this instance—would have the dinner ladies administering it. I wish the hon. Gentleman would give us the groups of people working in schools who he believes should have the right to administer corporal punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the private sector lads may bash one another as of right in the most appalling manner, but such uncivilised behaviour has no place in the public sector. Anybody doing that in the public sector would be either imprisoned or on charges of some kind for assault. At present it is teachers who administer corporal punishment in the maintained sector, and not every teacher by any means. Therefore, the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was simply explaining the current law. It says that those who are in loco parentis vis-à-vis certain pupils have a right to administer corporal punishment. The answer to the the question "Who is in loco parentis?" is exclusively a matter of fact, but the courts will not agree to the existence of such status unless the person exercises responsibility over the child. For the most part that means teachers, but it would be dangerous to say that the status is confined exclusively to teachers. I do not believe that it is. There will be a few others to whom it applies. For example, in state boarding schools some of those responsible for the care of the children will not be qualified teachers, but they will be in loco parentis in law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole Committee should examine the law with great care. As I said in my first brief speech, I have the impression that those who administer punishment are not so much in loco parentis as in loco draconis.

At this moment, except in private schools—known as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0347">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
public schools, for reasons that I do not understand—the only people who administer punishment are teachers. Teachers in the maintained sector believe that only teachers—and, indeed, only certain teachers can administer punishment and that according to law a child should not be beaten in front of a class. It is usually done by putting a name in a punishment book and having a witness. The law more or less arranges, or is interpreted by teachers to arrange, that the teacher should cool off and get over his or her temper and frustration and that the punishment should if possible be administered away from the other children. Most of us consider it disgraceful that other children should have to witness it when they themselves are innocent. It is like public execution. It should be done in the head's room with a punishment book and witness, so that if anything goes wrong and the child is injured in any way there is a witness to say that the punishment was carried out properly and that some kind of accident took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition cannot conceive of any reason why new clause 2 does not embody what any reasonable human being and certainly every teacher ought to accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will resist the amendment. I am extremely concerned not about the formal punishment—I am totally in sympathy with Opposition members in regard to how that has to be dealt with, and normally any sensible school manned by sensible staff with a sensible head teacher is run along those lines—but about an event which may occur in the assembly hall, the meal hall, the playground or wherever, but which cannot be dealt with in this strictly formal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are caretakers on school staffs as well as ancillary assistants and others who are not directly on the teaching staff, and they may well have to come to the assistance of the teaching staff to deal with a flash situation. It would be very wrong if teachers were exempt under the law while those who came to their assistance were not exempt. Indeed, interpretation of whether in fact they had participated in an act of corporal punishment would have to be determined by the court if vexatious litigation arose from such an incident. I would not want such members of staff—not provoking the incident or wishing to be involved but simply supporting the teaching staff—to be exposed because we had deliberately failed to exempt them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the wider he stretches the category of people who might in certain circumstances be involved in corporal punishment the wider he has to stretch access to the register? Does he accept that there are problems involved in making the register more widely available? Surely it would not be desirable for the register to be made available to, for example, everyone who provides school meals or lunchtime supervision. Although people should not chatter about who is or is not on the list there is always the temptation to do so, and, while I am sure that the vast majority of dinner ladies would observe the same professional standards as do teachers, some of them might not fully appreciate the implications of not doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take some of the points that the hon. Gentleman has made but the fact remains that at present
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
there is no case law arising out of such proposed legislation and only time will tell what the court ruling would be. What I would like to see and what the Bill at present ensures is that those members of staff who are involved in the day-to-day activities of a school and who play a supportive role to the teaching staff, wherever that may be—in the meal halls, the playing fields, the assembly areas or in the classrooms as ancillaries—have protection from the law if they come to the assistance of a teacher. That is why I support the broad brush approach that the Bill presently provides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have just had almost an echo of last Wednesday's debate when my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham raised questions about the definition of members of staff.

	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>

	<p>6.40 pm</p>

	<p>
	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we had to retire for a Division in the House, I was saying that my preliminary view was that an amendment to subsection (8) might be possible and desirable. Any amendment would need careful drafting to accord with the circumstances in Scotland as well as those in England and Wales. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham will understand that I cannot offer a Government amendment at this stage, but I can say something about my views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say straight away that I am not attracted to an amendment that would attempt to define who could and who could not use corporal punishment. The Bill adopts a very broad definition of corporal punishment. It embraces not only the use of the cane and the tawse but also slaps and smacks. With such a definition it is unwise to begin to list those members of staff who are forbidden in all circumstances to use corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot restrict the use of corporal punishment as defined to teachers alone. The supervision of pupils, whether it is by a school matron or a supervisor in a school dining room, carries with it responsibilities. It may be that a smack on the leg by one of those other members of staff is just what is needed to restore order when children get out of hand. I have in mind not the formal wielding of the cane but the more informal and reactive use of a smack.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no future in attempting a definitive list of all those who may and who may not use corporal punishment. I believe the Bill should be confined to describing the circumstances in which corporal punishment may be used rather than the persons who may use it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I go on, I may answer the point on which the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) perhaps wishes to intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our last sitting my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham intervened on the point that I am about to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0348">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
I should not wish subsection (8) to imply that we would be content to see anyone who happens to be working at a school—a window-cleaner, for example—given any authority to use corporal punishment. I believe that, taken with subsection (1), the Bill as it stands does not do this. To avoid any misunderstandings, I am looking at subsection (8) to see whether the definition of "member of staff" can be limited to teachers and others who have the supervision of pupils. I think an amendment might make subsection (8) clearer than it is now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that, without such a definition, the register must be more or less left open for inspection by anyone who may be involved in corporal punishment? The best approach may be to restrict who can examine the register, thereby in effect, restricting who can apply corporal punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his helpful suggestion and I undertake to consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the theme with which I started, I shall explore the possibility of an amendment that I have just outlined. If it proves practicable, I shall return to it on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 2 is an interesting and ingenious device, tabled as a result of the fertile imagination of the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish. Again, this is an amendment based on intervention. At present, schools use their common sense about who uses corporal punishment and who does not. The amendment does away with that capacity for local decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing common law gives those who have care and control of children certain rights and responsibilities. The amendment takes away some of those rights from some of those people, not because of the circumstances of the cases but because of the lack of academic qualifications or particular lengths of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Corporal punishment should be moderate and reasonable. Teachers of maturity and experience, such as the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mr. Flannery), may be more inclined to judge what is moderate and reasonable, but these are not matters that can be dealt with by detailed legislation. Much depends on the circumstances of cases and we should let the existing common law operate. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the new clause and the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the Minister is considering the problem of imposing a restriction and that he is doing so from two angles—who is appropriate to administer the corporal punishment and who should have access to the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I might be prepared to go along with the Minister's views on the smack, I do not agree that anyone other than a qualified teacher ought to administer formal corporal punishment—a cane or a strap. If that is administered, it should be done only by the head or by a senior teacher on the head's authority. If such a punishment is administered, it is important that it is formalised. The disgrace should apply the pressure rather than the physical hurt to the child. Only a member of staff who is professionally qualified and can take into account all the circumstances and the psychological effect on the child should administer such a punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are advantages in making it clear that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
legislation covers even the smallest slap, but if the Minister does that he must think carefully about the implications. If the scope is wide, the register must be inspected by all those allowed to do so. A parent's choice should not be open to general discussion in the community so the list of those entitled to inspect the register should be select. I hope that the Minister will try to make the list as select as possible without running into difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis I shall seek leave to withdraw the amendment and I shall not press the new clause. The Minister has made it clear that he is happy to return to the matter on Report. If we are not happy with his proposals, we reserve the right to debate the matter again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 74, in page 3, line 18, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"who is employed by the authority".</p></blockquote>
According to the notes on clauses paragraph 8(b) is intended to deal with a situation where pupils may be out of school at a field studies centre or at some other place where education is provided. I want to know who is subject to the provisions of this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill as drafted states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person working at that place who is employed by the authority."</p></blockquote>
If someone who was working at the place but was not employed by the authority, I presume that he would not be subject to the register. If a person working at a field studies centre run by an outside body—by a different local authority or by a person who was not employed by a local authority, as the Field Study Council centres are—he would be entitled to administer corporal punishment to any child, whether the child was on the register or not, if that person was not employed by the authority. On the other hand, if the person was employed by the authority, he would be entitled to administer corporal punishment only to children on the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we change the definition from
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person working at that place who is employed by the authority"</p></blockquote>
to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person working at that place",</p></blockquote>
in this instance we extend the provision of the register and narrow the category of people entitled to administer corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At first glance I thought that if we removed the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"who is employed by the authority"</p></blockquote>
we would do the opposite. I hope that I have now got the position right. If we want to include everyone who is providing education for a child, at a field study or any other place where education is being provided outside the school, it is better to use the shorter rather than the longer definition. I have had worries in moving the amendment, but I think it is now right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Gentleman's honest anxieties about amendment No. 74. The amendment would extend the definition of member of staff, where education was provided other than at school, to staff not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
employed by the local education authority. I think that the hon. Gentleman accepts that the definition would cause uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the situation outside a school can be different from that inside it, where it is right that certain staff not necessarily employed by the local education authority—for example, student teachers—should be subject to the restrictions under subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education at places other than a school may involve staff who have no connection with education. In a hospital, for example, nursing staff should not be subject to the provisions of the Bill. The only staff included should be those involved with the child's education. As that example shows, the problem is that outside the school the position is not as clear as it is inside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schools are, exclusively, educational establishments, and it is right that all those who work within them can be caught by the Bill. However, where a local education authority arranges education at a place other than the school, the place in question may well not be wholly educational. It would be difficult in such a case to produce a definition of members of staff which includes all those who should be included, and excludes all those who should not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government feel that all those working at the place in question who are employed by the local education authority should be included. If the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"who is employed by the authority"</p></blockquote>
are deleted, the Bill will catch those engaged in noneducational activities. In the light of that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not very happy with the Minister's explanation. It means that in his example of a hospital where education is provided, if a teacher who is having difficulty in persuading a child to take notice of lessons says, "Yes, your parents have said corporal punishment must not be applied to you", and he knows full well that as a teacher he cannot apply it, he can say to the nurse, "If you give him a good slap, you will be perfectly all right because you are not caught by the Bill."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that someone who is unhappy about punishing a child could persuade someone else, not employed by the authority, to administer corporal punishment. That worries me. It would be simpler to make clear that if a child is at a place for educational purposes he should not have corporal punishment administered to him, either by a person employed by the authority, or by a person employed by someone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, if someone comes in to give an outside lecture at a place other than a school, he is not subject to the register. Although there may then be a separate question of assault, it would be far better to include everybody involved in the education process and not just those people employed by the authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but I think that I have already answered quite carefully the points that he made just now and earlier. The teacher may not authorise another to use corporal punishment on an exempt child. That is provided under clause 1(1)(a). Of course there will be certain difficulties and malpractices, but they will occur anyway. Our hope is that they will not occur too frequently</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Freud</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speaking in this debate is almost like intruding on a private grief. You will have noticed, Mr. Morris, that I have not involved myself greatly in it, not because I am unhappy about particular amendments or even about particular clauses but because I am unhappy about the whole Bill. I think that it is a dotty Bill and I cannot remember when I last attended any Committee which made less sense to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was particularly taken by the Minister's argument that a short-sighted teacher might not be able to read the register and might hit the wrong child. As if that was not bizarre enough, I thought that new clause 2, moved by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), under which a teacher would have to have had three years' experience before he could hit anyone—which would presumably mean that the children would have to have a register of teachers, so that they could complain if the wrong teacher hit a child—was perhaps even better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I maintain that beating has never been responsible for translating a bad pupil into a good pupil. I doubt that it has made anyone better, although it has made many good pupils nervous and apprehensive and many bad pupils sullen and defiant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Bill is not being introduced through the Ministers volition or that of his Department. We do not want to damage the relationship between parents and children, although, and let us make no bones about it, that is exactly what will happen. A child will feel that a parent's failure to send a note to school will cause that child physical discomfort. We have not thought carefully enough about the problems in a family if a child says to his parents, "You will give me a note to take to school, won't you?" and the parent says, "No, I will not do that".

We are here because the European Court of Human Rights has decreed that a teacher can act in loco parentis only if he heeds the conviction of the parents for whom he is in loco. I should have thought that that decision was a golden opportunity to review our whole approach to the maintenance of discipline and to abandon a practice which many find offensive and whose value is open to most serious question.

For some 300 years people have looked at the problem of corporal punishment and have decided that on the whole it is a bad practice. We have now decided that on the whole it is not so much a bad practice as one whose end product is no better than the beginning product. I think we all agree that, if there is one occasion when corporal punishment is possibly justified, it is when it is not now being practised—that is, when a short sharp reaction is needed to something that has happened, instead of the offending child being punished by a third party who does not know what the offence was.

Under clause 1, we are discussing not discipline but corporal punishment, as the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr Ewing) said last week. I accept that it frequently makes teachers feel better, and it may not have a very serious effect on some children. But, in the context of discipline, I do not believe that for a small child to be hit by a large adult makes much sense. Again, hitting a child over the age of 15 makes much less sense. But, as I showed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
in the way that I voted on the matter, I feel that hitting a child under the age of reason makes some sense. After all, even quite a dense small child understands that pain is not much fun. There are those—I suspect that we shall hear a great deal from them when the Bill goes to the other place—who claim that corporal punishment has made them the men that they are today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'> Mr. Freud</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I finish this point? I wonder whether those men mean that if they had not been caned they would somehow be lesser men.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No reasonable thinking person would accept that corporal punishment—across the board and with blanket application, so to speak—is a sensible means of discipline. After all, some pupils simply do not respond to it, and tend to regard it as a tribal ritual to impress their peers. But without a doubt there are also pupils who benefit from corporal punishment. Having discussed the matter with many educationists in my county—head teachers and teachers at both primary and secondary level—I have found overwhelming support for the retention of corporal punishment, albeit with the caveat that it is its deterrent value which is beneficial to teachers and to pupils in the formation of their behaviour patterns at school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Freud</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tend to disagree with that, although I believe that for corporal punishment to be within a school's armoury is not altogether bad. I too spoke to many educationists in my constituency on the matter, and some of them said that they would like to retain corporal punishment, although they use it perhaps only once a year, or even less frequently. But the Bill will not give them that right. It is a dotty Bill; if it made sense, there might be some point in our discussing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am perfectly prepared to accept that we should have told the European Court of Human Rights exactly what it could do with its decision. Alternatively, we should have abided by that decision and said, "This is a great opportunity to abandon corporal punishment." What I object to is the waste of the Committee's time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to take up the point about why corporal punishment at school is not the same as physical chastisement in the home. In the light of the comments by the hon. Members for Croydon, North-West (Mr. Malins) and Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter), it seems that some people feel that although there may not be much support for corporal punishment in schools, it is perfectly all right to slap a child in the home. In tomorrow's edition of The Times there will be an opinion poll of however many people it is that the newspaper solicits for its polls, which finds that 66 per cent. of people in this country favour corporal punishment being retained in schools. A caveat is added that most of those people are working class—whatever that means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument is not about corporal punishment being retained, but that it will be retained selectively within a school. That will create an educational apartheid between one child and another. We are not

discussing the retention of corporal punishment but the fact that two children will be dealt with differently for the same offence. That is the basis of this nonsensical Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Freud</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never thought that the Bill was anything but nonsense. The hon. Gentleman has pointed out a complaint against the Bill which many hon. Members mentioned on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to The Times poll. I believe that the vast majority of those who voted in favour of corporal punishment did so because they smack their children. There is a difference between smacking children at home and subjecting them to corporal punishment in school. An opinion poll saying that more than 33 per cent. of people are against corporal punishment shows that the measure being introduced will be impractical.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to say why it is wrong to make a connection between a parent striking a child and corporal punishment in school. There is no such connection. Generally, parents do not use an implement. They slap. That slap is not organised or ritualised. It is given in the context of a loving, trusting relationship. Explanations are given and often apologies are made afterwards. That is very unlike what happens in school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Parents generally slap younger children more than older ones because it is a punishment for those who are too young to appreciate reason and argument. Yet, in school, older children are caned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That remark needs amplification, because it does not accord with the experience of most Conservative Members. Will the hon. Gentleman reconsider his line of reasoning?

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not pursue the matter further. There is not a great deal of difference in approach between the hon. Members for Oxford, East (Mr. Norris) and for Staffordshire, South-East and me. In the context of education today, we should be discussing the problem that the Bill suggests that the cane is a solution to the complex problem of discipline. That is what the clause deals with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Freud</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, this clause does. That is why I want to make a few points in the clause stand part debate. The Bill ignores the factors outside schools. It does not involve the parents in the behavioural standards of their children once they have failed to sign a piece of paper. The experience of local education authorities which have abolished corporal punishment and found alternatives to maintaining discipline is not taken into account. No study appears to have been made of that evidence by the Department of Education and Science. I refer the Minister to the Derbyshire authority which set up a working party in 1981 to report on alternatives. It was an excellent working party. There is a thorough and well-considered report which sets discipline in the context of education as a whole. It discusses the implications of abolition. The options discussed are actually costed. The Minister should think with great care, and bear in mind that of course it is cost-effective to slap a child. It needs no explanation and no teacher's time. It is also cost-effective to hang someone. It is not necessary to keep them in prison, although if the decision is wrong, compensation has to be paid and the person has to be re-buried in consecrated ground if he was buried elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should look at alternatives and cost them. The Department of Education does not seem to have thought though that approach. It has taken the easy option, but that option does not make sense to me and it begs the real issue of what one does with children who behave badly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that clause 1 should stand part of the Bill, nor do I believe that the Bill should stand part of the education system. It is a lot of nonsense from beginning to end and it would almost take us back centuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On second reading, we discussed corporal punishment and I related an anecdote about a teacher whom I knew. He was a very kindly man but not a particularly good teacher and he caned all the kids because he had trouble. When I heard the hon. Member for Staffordshire, South-East (Mr. Lightbown) say that there was anger in the home when a parent hit a child but that that was not true in school, he conveyed an impression that in school if there is to be a register it will formalise matters even further—punishment was carried out in a cool manner. What utter nonsense! The fact is that all beatings in school are carried out in temper. It is regrettable and terrible and I believe that I have witnessed more of it than anyone in this Committee Room. It is simply not true that it is carried out coolly and calmly. Moreover, if it were true it would be even more deadly because there would be no excuse at all for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not like splits to develop on the Opposition Benches in the course of the debate, but the hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East (Mr. Freud) said that caning does not make a bad child into a good child. I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman, but I wish to add that neither does the use of the cane make a bad teacher into a good teacher. On the contrary, corporal punishment is usually born of frustration because the teacher has failed to convey to the child whatever it was that he wished to convey. Violence has many ramifications but, fundamentally, it is frustration that produces it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
The clause is a farce and it is unworkable. We talk about children being caned and of having a register, but when facts are examined one finds that it is always the same children who are caned, over and over again—which is proof that caning does no good at all. The same children are caned all the time and it is the same teachers who cane them all the time. There are caners and non-caners in the teaching profession and the children who are caned are, basically, the same children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I listen to the cries of "Hear, hear" coming from the Conservative Benches when the trite little statement of, "They want to retain the cane because it is used only once a year" is made, I realise that it is utter claptrap. It is not true that corporal punishment is used only once a year. All the caners say that they use the cane only once a year. The reason why clause 1 is wrong is that as soon as someone says of corporal punishment, "Retain it because we don't use it very much but only sparingly", all Conservative Members say "Hear, hear". But that is totally untrue. Corporal punishment is carried out on a grand scale and its use will increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the children who now are caned will be uncaned because of the register. Therefore, there will be a new set-up, and among the children who now are caned there will be two types as a result of the register—those who are caned and those who are not. We are compounding the felony all the way along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause, we shall have to deal with punishment of those over 16 years of age. If one thing shows how silly the whole business is, it is that a group of grown men on the Conservative Benches are saying that we should go on beating 16-year-olds. They should take the cane from the caner, as happened in Dotheboys Hall, lay about him with it, and not proceed with what is being asked for in 1985. There should be no cane, then no teacher would be in trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is massive evidence that attacks on teachers have decreased in schools where there is no caning, proving that there is resentment among children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Conservative Member of the Committee—I think he has probably been a teacher—said that some children benefit and that he had his own register that said, "Put some over there because they benefit, put the others over here because they do not benefit." It is a farce if teachers say they will cane only those pupils who they know will benefit but not those who will not benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Lightbown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was suggesting that the average teacher is sufficiently intelligent to understand the best way of obtaining discipline from pupils. A blanket approach should not be used with any pupil. A teacher learns about his pupils and understands the best way to discipline each pupil.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman underlines my point. I agree that a teacher knows the sort of discipline
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
that is required. But if he thinks that one form of discipline should be caning, he is terribly wrong. He should be engaged in tutorial and educational discipline, not punishment by beating. Clause 1 should not be part of any Bill because it is nonsense and anti-educational, and the felony will be compounded in the rest of this Bill</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I remember that when I was working in a school during the late 1960s a colleague came into the staff room one morning in high indignation to announce that corporal punishment would disappear from English schools within 10 years and that he was determined to be one of the last people to use it. His reason was than he had discovered that British Rail was phasing out the carriages with the old-fashioned drop windows that were dependent on the leather strap. He then outlined his plans to go out and vandalise three British Rail carriages so that he would be well prepared for the next 10 years. In fact, his predictions were not fulfilled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that anyone who reads the report of our debates or Clause 1, and then reads what the teachers' unions, local authority associations and other people who produce a guide book to the legislation say, will decide that it is better to abolish corporal punishment in their schools, rather than get involved in all the legalities and problems that we have explored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would prefer this to be an abolition Bill. However, I suspect that when it has been analysed it will turn out to be an abolition Bill. For that reason the Bill is welcome and it is important that we continue to probe and draw out the inconsistencies and problems. It would be foolish to defeat the whole measure because it will be a stepping stone to abolition. When we come to the next clause perhaps we can insert a safeguard provision so that when the Secretary of State discovers that it has become an abolition Bill he can convert it by regulation very simply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is a first step on the way to abolition. We have not spent much time discussing the immense divisions that the Bill will create if it is enacted. It will definitely create family divisions between children at school and their families and between the children and the staff at school.

The Bill will create immense problems. There is also the appalling prospect of children being subjected to wholly different regimes.

The hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East (Mr. Freud), in one of his customarily entertaining
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>

It relates to the fact that many teachers see corporal punishment as part of discipline and as one of the options likely to be available to them. As the hon.

Perhaps later he will tell us his sources, because we are all agog to know how he found out such useful information.

Clause 1 is the cornerstone of the Bill. The Opposition have sought to destroy or amend its underlying principles.
