	<i>Further amendment (
	<i>i</i>) moved to the new clause[18th March]</i>—in subsection (3)(
	<i>b</i>) leave out "or principal".—[
	<i>Mr. Jopling.</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed.</i></p>

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are discussing amendment (
	<i>j</i>), in subsection (4), leave out "or principal".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is a purely probing amendment. The literal reason for the amendment is that one is confronted with the juxtaposition of alternatives. One oriterion is the "only" and the other is the "principal" source of livelihood derived from work on the holding. We go from the one extreme of "only", that is to say, exclusively, to the other of "principal". I am querying why we denude the express and exclusively absolute criterion of "only" to "or prinicipal" source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have the Parliamentary Secretary and his advisers given proper and careful thought to the routines adopted by Her Majesty's Inspectors of Taxes reflected in the various tax Acts to treat income as that derived from trade, profession or vocation? That would be the literal interpretation of "derived from the holding", but that would not necessarily exclude a disputatious argument about income which might be categorised by the Inland Revenue under Schedule D, Case 6 type income, which need not necessarily inhibit the type of definition for which we are striving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, further clarification is called for in so far as there is this curious juxtaposition of "only" on the one hand, which is denuded to "or principal" on the other, and we require explanation and enlightenment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>898</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us whether it is correct that the principal or only source of livelihood has to relate to work on the holding? I have the feeling that it refers to the person's total income, whether from shares or from some other business such as a haulage business, which might have nothing to do with that person's income from the holding. Is it necessary for the Agricultural Land Tribunal to obtain the person's income tax returns to ascertain what is his principal source of income? An "only" source of income and a "principal" source of income cannot be the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Agricultural Land Tribunal have to examine the income to see whether it is the principal income, and will the Tribunal have to be given the income tax returns of the various parties who are trying to get the succession of tenancy? It is somewhat unusual for copies of income tax returns over a certain number of years to have to be submitted to the Tribunal to enable it to find out whether a person is deriving the majority of his income from the holding. I should be glad of a further explanation of what the paragraph means, what the Agricultural Land Tribunal will be able to demand, what an applicant will have to provide for the Tribunal and what the landlord can ask the Tribunal to investigate before a tenancy is granted to any of the would-be tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Colin Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not share the semantic concern expressed by hon. Members about the precise meaning of "or principal", but I am concerned about the nature of the clause. I had sought to move an amendment to delete subsection (3)(
	<i>b</i>). Unfortunately, the amendment could not be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary knows of my disquiet about the clause. We are assuming that every holding will be of sufficient size to support two families, and it is extremely difficult to ensure that the criterion of the principal source of livelihood can be fulfilled on all occasions. There might be a holding of a size which enabled a son to help on occasions although the economic viability of the holding would make it impossible for two families to be supported by it. I do not say that that is a reason for preventing a son who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0495">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>899</span>
may have been brought up on the holding from having the right to take it over, but I am concerned that according to the paragraph we seem to be saying that only on a holding which is large enough to support two families is there any possibility of the son succeeding. We specifically exclude the possibility of a son succeeding to any tenancy which is not large enough to support his family and his father's family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most tenanted holdings are fairly small. We tend to think that we are talking in terms of 3,000 acres, but there are plenty of tenanted holdings of between 50 acres and 150 acres which would be unable to support two families. I hope that the Minister will take note of my comments and do something about this problem, otherwise, I shall have to find a device amongst the remaining amendments put down by the Opposition to enable me to vote against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Included in the small holding legislation there is a provision that the viability of the holding must be such that it can support the owner and one other. There is somewhere in the great mass of papers I have something which indicates that that is a mark of the viability of the holding. To a certain extent that answers the point made by the hon. Member for Dudley West (Dr. Phipps).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that we are talking about cases of hardship. If a person's livelihood is his only source of livelihood that is not the same as his principal source of livelihood. We must keep that in mind, otherwise we get wider and wider, as we did in our last debate, when more and more people were brought into an already wide clause. I hope that the Minister will look favourably at the idea behind the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to follow up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, West (Dr. Phipps), on subsection (3)(
	<i>b</i>). Far from being too broad, the paragraph is too narrow. If there is any argument in the Committee it should be in the direction of substituting "principal" by "main or secondary". We all know of smallholdings in which the income is insufficient for two families and where there
	<span class='label label-info column'>900</span>
is insufficient work to keep two families fully employed. The son often works elsewhere but gives a large number of man-hours to the holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are straining matters too far to say that because a son who has been working alongside his father for many years has a job on the roads with the council, hardship is not involved because he can continue to work for the council. A great deal of hardship is involved, and a great deal of injustice. We are not considering hardship in terms of total penury, we are talking about injustice. A great deal of injustice would be suffered by the man who has worked on the land and who does not fall within the criterion that that is his only means of livelihood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will reject the amendment and give sympathetic consideration to my hon. Friend's request that the criterion should be removed altogether. Failing that, on Report, my hon. Friend should introduce some such phraseology as "main or secondary".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here again the Opposition want to narrow the number of people who will be eligible to apply for the tenancy of the holding, while my hon. Friends wish to extend the eligibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Agricultural Land Tribunal should have a criterion to enable it to decide whether an applicant is eligible. We take it to be part of our scheme that the applicant should have a definite link with the holding and that it is insufficient for him to be a near relative. I think that there is agreement on both sides of the Committee that it would be unreasonable to give the son who had, perhaps, spent the last 50 years in Australia the right to come back on his father's death and take over the holding. Once we decide that there should be a link with the holding we have to decide the best way of writing that into the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has not covered the point I am trying to get at. If the holding were large, presumably the son coming back from Australia would be able to take it over under the legislation. We a~e soecifically excluding not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>901</span>
sons who come back from Australia, but sons who could be living next door but who are unable to derive a living from the holding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The latter part of my remarks may be more helpful to my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have laid down in the list of criteria that the son must have worked on the holding for five out of the last seven years or attended an educational college for part of that time. In no circumstances are we envisaging regulations on the size of the holding for the son who has gone to Australia and will come back. Basically we are talking about hardship in this context. Once we decided that there was to be a link with the holding we then had to lay down that he should have worked for so many years, say five out of seven, on Ihe holding. We then have to decide what do we mean by "worked on it". Do we mean full-time? We can see difficulties in defining this. Do we mean worked for 365 days in a year or worked for six hours a day, or what?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to see how we came to the conclusion that the best way to decide whether he was working full-time on the holding was to specify that his principal source of income should have come from working on that holding. Hon. Members have raised the point about the word "only". This was simply to bring out a whole range of options from "only" to "principal". Strictly speaking the word "only" is redundant and "principal source" would cover it. It is a semantic point. It is clear that we are saying his principal source of income should have been the holding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to differ with the hon. Gentleman's interpretation. "Only" is the starting point. Therefore subsequent words, on any fair interpretation, must relate to the starting criterion, which is "only", that is, exclusively. They must correspond in some relateable way to the "only". Hence my queries regarding the exclusion of other sources of income. I am seeking clarification on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the amendments moved by hon. Members opposite seeks to narrow it down to "only" source of income. I do not know whether they are
	<span class='label label-info column'>902</span>
serious. It would be positively ridiculous to specify that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Interest on Post Office savings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. I hope hon. Members opposite will not press that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point of the hon. Member. The onus will be on the applicant to prove his claim that the holding provides the principal source of income. The procedure for this will have in any case to be set out in the appropriate statutory instrument, and here again we are back at the question of procedures which will have to be laid down by statutory instrument following the enactment of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be helpful to the Committee if the Minister were to publish now some sort of draft of the ideas he may have in mind for the regulations, so that we could see them in relation to this clause. I know it is difficult to know what comes first, the chicken or the egg. I know that some of the regulations must be governed by what we pass in the Bill. On the other hand, we are passing certain legislation and giving a 
	<i>carte blanche</i> for regulations to be produced later. It would be helpful to all of us if we knew what is in the mind of the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always like to be helpful to hon. Members but I do not agree on that point. We have to face the fact that here we are discussing the basic principles of the legislation. That is right and proper. After all the statutory instrument will be debated in Parliament. We should argue over the content of the legislation and we should have the benefit of hon. Members' comments before we seek to draw up any draft scheme or regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman lapsed just now in his remarks talking about the principal source of "income". That is not the word. It the principal source of "livelihood". Here we are getting down to details and the Parliamentary Secretary made a genuine mistake. The principal source of livelihood could be different from the principal source of income. There are emoluments for example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has raised a valid point. Naturally we gave
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>903</span>
some thought to this question as to how we would define this requirement. The more we thought about it the more we came to the conclusion that we really wanted to give the tribunal a degree of flexibility here. After all, we are going to have a tribunal looking at this initially. Having got that situation hon. Members might agree that we are likely to have fewer anomalous cases and injustices if, on balance, we give the tribunal greater rather ithan less scope to decide what constitutes a principal source of livelihood. If we were to lay down that it had to be over 50 or 70 per cent, that would be too rigid. The sensible thing is to use the phraseology which we have got in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have raised a very important point relating to the holding which is by no means a very small one but is not large enough to support the father and son working full time, but where for all practical purposes the son has a link with the holding and would like to follow on after his father, was brought up on the holding and perhaps has helped out his father at different times in the year. We would like to do something here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that I should spell out that in many firms below commercial size it should still be possible for the close relatives both to work on the farm and supplement their income by some other part-time work and still qualify. On the really small farm this may not be possible. We are in a dilemma here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Wales said on 8th March:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… a claim to succession has moral force only if the relative concerned has developed over a period of years a close knowledge, understanding and affinity with the land in question."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th March 1976; Vol. 907, c. 48.]</p></blockquote>
In other words, some direct link with the land is essential for a scheme the purpose of which is the avoidance of hardship. A requirement that the applicant has to have derived his sole or principal livelihood from the holding for at least five out of the last seven years is our way of achieving this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to help my hon. Friends if I can, and it seems to me that instead of this being a somewhat rigid test of eligibility as it is now, which does not
	<span class='label label-info column'>904</span>
find favour with my hon. Friends, it might be possible to make it into a more discretionary test by removing it into new Clause 10, and perhaps subsection (8); or, more probably, to leave it where it is and give the Agricultural Land Tribunal a discretionary power to be used in the case of smaller holdings. There may be other ways of achieving the same result. I am willing to examine this with the aim of tabling an amendment on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must not raise the hopes of my hon, Friends too much. The direct link with the farm is an essential part of our policy and must be retained. If we open the door for the son who has not worked on the holding, for whatever reason, we shall be opening the door to the son from the Antipodes mentioned by my right hon. and learned Friend on 8th March and this is something we are not willing to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We still do not seem to be getting at the root of the problem facing us, especially in west Wales. The problem is that in Carmarthenshire, Cardiganshire and other Welsh counties the average size of the farms is 50 acres or less. We have many a farm in my part of the world where the young son, perhaps the only son, at the age of 17 or 18, because he cannot get his livelihood from that farm, has to find work for a period of, say, five or ten years, but goes home every night to sleep at his parents' farm. When he gets married he has automatically got to move out, but the main aim of that family and of that son is that the son should come home to the farm, once his father retires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that the Minister has made a concession, but I think we still need more clarification. There are some hardship cases which will face the tribunal in the years to come. I do not want to safeguard the interests of the son who has gone to Australia or London or has any other profession, but I must still insist on looking after the farmer who, due to the nature and size of the farm, is only able to derive his livelihood from that farm, to which the son is very keen to come back. In our part of the world although farming is a way of life there is a social aspect as well. If we want to keep young people in the countryside they must have a right to come back to their parents' farms to farm them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I challenge anyone to define what is a viable acreage. One farm in Cardigan-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>905</span>
shire is only 11 acres and employs 30 people. We have farms of perhaps 1,000 or 2,000 acres where only one is employed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And 10 sheep.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although we are sheep farmers I am sure we have made a contribution to the economy of this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way of life is very important in west Wales, and if we can look after the interests of the son who wants to go back to the farm and farm it the Minister will be doing a great deal to help those farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that short interjection. I agree we cannot define the viability of a holding on the basis of acreage. The point the hon. Member is making in the context of Wales is precisely the one my hon. Friends have been making. That is precisely the point I am replying to. That is what I have committed us to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure we shall amend the Bill and try to give this concession for the sort of person the hon. Member has described. In other words the holding, by definition, will be one which cannot support and is not supporting more than one person working full time. That is why I spelt out that one way we might be able to do this is to give discretion to the Agricultural Land Tribunal, that where it is a small holding and it is not reasonable to have a requirement that the son should be working there with his father the son will be able, under our provisions, to apply to the ALT for a tenancy. I can assure the hon. Member that it is precisely this point that the Government intend to address themselves to, and to table an appropriate amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted with that reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must press the Minister a little. This is fundamental. Under new Clause 11 this is one of the reasons the landlord can apply to the tribunal for the tenancy not to be hereditary. It is not this definition which is in the Agriculture Act 1967. If we are to get away from the definition that a holding can support two people we are in deep water indeed and it will strike at the roots of this and other provisions. The Minister must indicate
	<span class='label label-info column'>906</span>
a little more whether this discretionary power is likely to override entirely the provisions of new Clause 11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not want to prolong this debate unduly. My understanding of what the hon. Member says is that at a later stage in our provisions we lay down that the landlord will be able to resist a succession on the ground that this is a basically unviable holding which he intends to amalgamate with another holding in order to create a commercial holding. That will still stand, but in the vast majority of cases the landlord will not have a smallholding next door, or will not intend to make the amalgamation. The provision which the landlord will have to apply will still stand—we are not contradicting that—and his argument will be taken at the next stage. The Agricultural Land Tribunal will have to make up its mind on the basis of the merits of the respective cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Parliamentary Secretary is now saying poses some interesting questions. I should be entirely happy with the undertaking he has given on the broad basis of the safeguard of the commercial unit definition at the lower end, and the application of stringent criteria, in terms of deriving livelihood, as we move up the scale. It would be entirely compatible with the aims of social justice which we are endeavouring to secure. However, if the criteria of a commercial unit, and action by (the landlord under new Clause 11, would not apply simply because the circumstances would not obtain in terms of a neighbouring farm, the Minister will have to indicate to the Agricultural Land Tribunal some area in which its discretion applies and conversely ceases to apply. Tenants of 3,000 and 5,000 acres will obviously be crowned with glory when this particular amendment is passed, and clearly, we do not want to pay out the rope in relation to that kind of tenancy. The criteria must be wholly stringent—I am sure the Minister would not diverge one iota from these sentiments—at the top end of the scale. The difficulty is found at the point where the two aspects merge. At what point do we move out of the smaller type of situation, with which I have much sympathy, where the landlord has not the redress or the protection

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek a little further clarification before the Minister replies. We have had his welcome reply concerning the discretion of the tribunal. That is the sensible way to approach it, but the question of physical contact with the farm is difficult. There are many areas of the country—west Wales is one of them—where the possibility of a son being able to obtain work locally does not exist. He may go to London because it is the only place where he can find a job. There has to be some provision for this kind of case. If the intention in the family is that the son should take over, irrespective of the place in which the son is living, this must be an important factor. I appreciate that it is difficult to write it into the Bill, but I should have thought that broad guidelines could be given to the tribunal. If we say that the son has to live within the area we shall create great difficulties in an area in which employment is hard to find.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still replying. Those were interjections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point that it would be a great mistake to write in rigid criteria. When I was responding to the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) I did not mean to imply that the son would have to be living on the farm or in the household. I was responding to the extreme case that he was describing. I was using the word "small"—this touches the point raised by the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins)—as the opposite of "large".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the point put by the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) concerning the larger holdings, where there are at least three or
	<span class='label label-info column'>908</span>
four and in many cases more men working on the farm, I think we are all agreed that we would expect the son to have worked on the holding for five out of seven years, or to have spent three of them at college. The hon. Member may rest assured on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the "principal source of income", I hope that the hon. Gentleman would not want to deprive the son who is working on that larger holding and happens to have another income which is less than the livelihood he is obtaining from the farm. I do not think the hon. Gentleman would want to do that. Certainly it would not be our intention to exclude the son on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that it is right to have this link with the holding, and that our way of defining the link is the correct one, but we appreciate the point raised by hon. Members with regard to the smaller holding, where it is not feasible and practical to expect a son to follow on. In that area we should go further, we feel, in giving the tribunal the right to grant the tenancy to the son who is working on a larger holding. Hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be very careful, particularly when we hear these persuasive noises from Wales. The EEC produced two very helpful Directives, 159 and 160, in 1972, on the cessation of smallholding and on amalgamation. Once these directives are put into effect, there is no doubt that holdings of the kind mentioned will be able to receive very substantial help from the FEOGA. I do not wish to appear harsh or abrasive, but if we become sentimental and fall for

	<span class='label label-info column'>909</span>
some of the blandishments from Wales, it will prejudice the long-term future of Welsh agriculture and the agriculture of other areas. There is an opportunity of obtaining this help out of FEOGA and I hope we shall take advantage of it. The Government have so far done nothing about the two 1972 EEC directives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has not exactly gone the way I thought it might when I moved the amendment last Thursday morning. I hoped there would be a fairly short debate on what the Government meant by "principal", and that we could then move on to some of the other matters contained in amendments (
	<i>k</i>) and (
	<i>jj</i>), covering some of the matters we have been discussing. For that reason I shall in reply confine myself to the very narrow point of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In moving the amendment I asked for an explanation of what the words are held to mean, and I am not very much wiser now, having listened to the Parliamentary Secretary. I believe that this is a crucial matter. The hon. Member for Dudley, West (Dr. Phipps) spoke of the possibility of the son of a tenant farmer in west Wales working in London. This seems to me to be breaking ground which has never been envisaged by anybody before. It is a totally new concept, and alarms me very greatly indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's intention in the new clause is perfectly clear in relation to the meaning of the word "principal" in paragraph (
	<i>b</i>). The meaning of paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) seems to me to be reasonably clear, but it needs a certain amount of clarification and amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general principle of what the Government are after seems to be totally clear. The young man must have worked on the holding for five out of seven years. We shall come later to the possibility of a period of education, which is a different matter. I think the assumption is that it must be a holding on which there is enough work for the son, or a close relative, to do. That seems to be implied in the Government's proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We really must be told in more detail what the Government mean when they talk of a "principal source of livelihood". I hope the Minister will return to this later this morning and give us more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider a holding on which there is clearly sufficient work for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>910</span>
son—to use a shorthand term. This might be a holding such as the one mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins), with the possibility of the young man having engaged in other activities. What percentage of his livelihood does the Minister think should be derived from the young man's work on that holding in a case of that sort? The Minister has not told us. Would he advise the Agricultural Land Tribunal to say that the definition of "principal source of livelihood", in the case of a holding such as this, should be over 90 per cent.? Is that the sort of figure to which the Minister would subscribe? I understand his reluctance over very small holdings, but he can leave those aside in his reply. Let him tell us what sort of shut-off point he would expect in percentage terms for a substantial holding where there was clearly work for a near relative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the purpose of my amendment in the first place. I was not thinking of the very small holding where difficulties might arise. I think that 90 per cent, would be a reasonable figure and that if a near relative got more than 10 per cent, of his livelihood from other work he would be excluded according to paragraph (
	<i>b</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend thought of another aspect? Under the Act, which has a definition, this poor man cannot get an agricultural grant if his holding falls within these terms.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. It is ridiculous we should be doing this. It amounts to perpetuating that which we wish to end, a group of people working farms which are wholly uneconomic for a living which is not compatible with modern life at all. When we sat through days and weeks in Committee eight or nine years ago, when we talked about amalgamations in discussing the 1967 Agriculture Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor, either Lord Hoy or Mr. Mackie, I think the latter, spoke at great length about Government policy being to do away with these holdings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I began by saying that I hoped not to be carried away. I do not think, with respect, that I have been embarking on paragraph (

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could be a little more helpful. I always like to try. The hon. Member has accepted my point about small holdings but is asking me to elaborate further on "principal" in relation to whether a son can be accepted to be working with his father. "Principal" means more than half, and that is what it means in this legislation, but we want to give the tribunal flexibility in relation to these matters. Hon. Members have acknowledged this. Basically we are talking about matters where the cut-off point is bound to be difficult, and that is why it should be decided by the tribunal within this framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member made a final point. Would he remind me of it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amalgamations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, yes, amalgamations, ll is often best that a really small farm should be amalgamated with other land to form a larger and more viable holding, and I have explained that what we are proposing here does not preempt that, but if the son is not allowed to succeed to the farm it is not a guarantee that it will be amalgamated. So the procedure is that, first, the Agricultural Land Tribunal has to decide whether an individual is an eligible person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the new clause stands, the person my hon. Friends describe, the person with more than one living, will be excluded and will not be eligible so that the tribunal will at the first stage rule out the application for a tenancy, but if we introduce the concession I have indicated, to meet the point made by my hon. Friends, an individual who could not get his living out of a farm would now become an eligible
	<span class='label label-info column'>912</span>
person. The Agricultural Land Tribunal would decide whether he would be an eligible person and would then have to decide whether he would be a suitable person to succeed to the holding. The landlord will be able to give his reasons why he feels that this eligible person is not suitable to take over the holding, and hon. Members can see in later clauses how it is spelt out, and how the landlord is able to resist an application for a tenancy from an eligible person, if he is going to amalgamate that smallholding with another to create a viable farm. That point still stands and will not be negated by the concession I have suggested. I cannot be accused of not making it clear. I have tried to spell out clearly what we have in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the new clause, in line 31 after "his" insert "agricultural".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment draws attention to what I think is a serious drafting error in this new clause. The reason for moving it in part follows from the discussion we have been having already with regard to the type of activity the near relative takes part in on the holding. We have already had a good deal of discussion about what might happen if there was not enough work for the son—using "son" as shorthand for near relative—to embark on. It may be that he has to have done a certain amount of work on the holding, although I must say in passing that I was concerned at hearing the Parliamentary Secretary's last reply in which he said that the definition of "principal" is anything over half. I find that far too low and it would be a good idea to write in something like "principal, being over 90 per cent, of the total livelihood of that person".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the point we have already discussed about the nature of the work which a young man might be embarking upon. It is right that we should say clearly here that the work he embarks on is wholly of an agricultural nature. I put down an amendment (
	<i>l</i>) which has not been selected; that refers to the relevant section in the 1948 Act which defines in some detail what "agricultural" means. That section of the 1948 Act would confine the young man's work on the holding to work which comes within that broad definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It occurs to me—this is why I think
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>913</span>
there is a serious drafting error—that when we talk about "work" on a holding it could mean virtually anything. It could mean he is a journalist or an accountant or a professional figure of any sort. He might have his office on the holding, in the farmhouse. There are substantial farmhouses which are now much too large for a family to occupy. I can well envisage a situation where a son of the house might have set up in part of the house business in an occupation which has nothing to do with agriculture. He could be a journalist, he could be carrying on a mail order business or other professional activity. It is essential that this point is dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot believe that the Government have gone to the trouble of putting into paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) a proposal that in five out of seven years the applicant must have worked on the holding without being clear that in general it is agricultural work which the Government have in mind. The definition, however, could cover almost any work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that the Government will see the force of the argument and will agree to meet this amendment or suggest one in its place which deals with my point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support this amendment and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will consider it seriously. I come back to the holding in Wales, and there are similar ones in Cornwall and Devon, of 50 to 60 acres, which survive in the main because they have been taking in holiday-makers and have become almost small leisure centres or caravan sites. So much of what they have done is intended to dovetail into the agricultural side. For example, a caravan site can be a useful outlet for the sale of milk, and can support a son and perhaps even a daughter primarily engaged in looking after holidaymakers and other visitors to the farm. With the holiday season going from Easter to the end of September there is something of a livelihood to be gained by a young man or a girl on a farm of this kind. I therefore hope that the Minister will consider this seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried at the way these wretched holdings—I am not trying to be unpleasant—in Wales, Devon and elsewhere are becoming petrified. In the earlier debate my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) reminded us
	<span class='label label-info column'>914</span>
of the discussions on the 1967 Bill when the trumpets were making a loud noise through Lord Mackie, as he is now. Only 6,000 holdings in these 10 years have been amalgamated, and the wonder is that so many of those smallholdings have been able to integrate, with their limited range of agriculture, other activities—caravan sites and the rest. In Scotland one finds part-time forestry work and other examples connected with industries and trades which are not purely agricultural. This is a bad thing for agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the health of our industry we want to maintain the advantages of the 1967 Bill, and that was the reason why at the time we wholeheartedly supported grants for amalgamations. The House supported the principle of giving such grants, but now we look back after 10 years and find that the scheme has failed because we have had only 6,000 amalgamations as a result of that legislation. We are going to have, as a result of the way this new clause stands, sons and daughters taking over a holding so as to maintain what is, in fact, a non-agricultural use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) has suggested that in answering the debate on an earlier amendment I had to some extent strayed on to ground covered by the nsxt amendment. I did so intentionally, because I thought it would be helpful to hon. Members to know, before coming to those amendments, the response of the Government to points made by my hon. Friends. It has turned out to be a sensible course of action because I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that it is not our intention that the definition should be so wide as to admit applicants whose income has not been derived from working on the land. I take the hon. Gentleman's point. It was felt that it would make the position clearer if we inserted the word "agricultural". It is for that reason that I am happy to respond by accenting this amendment, to put beyond doubt that it is our intention that the applicant should have derived his income from working on the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the new clause, at the end of subsection (3)(
	<i>c</i>), insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided he was working on the farm at the time of death".</p></blockquote>
In the euphoria of -that last debate I hasten to move another amendment in the hope that this, too, will be accepted by the Government and the Committee. As you will know, Mr. Costain, this amendment was put down quite recently for a reason coming directly from a letter which I received— I am not sure whether other Members of the Committee will have received it—from Mr James Paice, Chairman of the Agricultural Policy Committee of the National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will clearly remember that during the debate on the Floor of the House, there was a good deal of comment on a paper sent round by the National Federation. It may be recalled that at that stage the agricultural policy committee, in putting out that brief as its view, made absolutely clear that it was not yet backed by the Council of the National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs. In truth, the content of that expression of view from the agricultural policy committee at that time was pretty rude about these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to read at the foot of the letter from Mr. Paice to me, dated 12th March—and perhaps I might have the attention of the hon. Member for Dudley, West (Dr. Phipps) as I believe these will be matters of great interest to him—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Please note, the Young Farmers' Clubs Agricultural Policy was approved by the Council. The only complaint being it was"too mild!"</p></blockquote>
The Council of the National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs has said that these proposals are not very good. Certainly, it appeared so from the use made of its comments in the debate on the Floor of the House. It seems now that its position has been strengthened even more now that the proposals have gone before it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>916</span>
In his letter Mr. Paice says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The second item which has occurred is regarding the five years out of seven which should have been worked on the farm in question. We believe that it should stipulate that the applicant should be engaged on the farm at the time of the tenant's death."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Paice went on to propose an amendment which I put down but which unfortunately, Mr. Costain, you decided was out of order; so I withdrew the amendment that had been proposed and have drafted this one in its place. I believe the Committee will agree that it covers the point made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that there is this feeling among this very influential body of people. The Young Farmers' Clubs have made clear to us that they are not political and that they do not wish to subscribe to any political party but merely want to express their view on what they believe is in the best interests of their members and of the agriculture industry as a whole. I can perfectly well see—and a good deal was made of this in the debate in the House—that there is among their members a view that the effect of these clauses will be, as we have said constantly, an increase in the rate of drying up of the supply of farms to rent. Their members feel, as do we on this side of the Committee, that these proposals go too far and ought to be drawn back. That is a remark that I have made on many occasions and, no doubt, before we are through with these new clauses, I shall be making it a good many more times. Here is an opportunity for the Government to draw back on the impact of those proposals. I would have thought that, of all the bodies around the countryside representing groups of people engaged in agriculture, the Young Farmers' Clubs would be the one organisation of whose view the Government would wish to take a very large amount of notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe it is a good thing to suggest that the applicant should be working on the farm at the time of the tenant's death; but we want to avoid the situation where a young man who has done his five years out of the last seven, and is filling in a year or two doing something which has nothing whatever to do with work on the holding, is affected. This is a sensible amendment, and after the very helpful Government reply to the last one, I hope that they will be able to accept this one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have spelt out our feeling that an applicant should have worked five out of the preceding seven years on the holding. The hon. Member is proposing that at the time of death the applicant must have been working on the deceased's holding. It could happen, for example, that there were two sons and the farmer might have thought it sensible for one son to work on his own holding, with the intention of taking it over, but also to spend a couple of years working on another holding, perhaps of a different type, to broaden his agricultural experience. In that case, whether one or both sons would be eligible to succeed to the holding would depend on who happened to be working on the father's holding at the time of death. Surely, that is not tenable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is the intention that the son should succeed to the holding, and if the son has worked five out of the seven preceding years on it, but just happens to be in the course of working for perhaps another year on some other holding—it could be on the farm of an uncle, a dairy farm, because that son wants to broaden his experience and perhaps to introduce dairying into his own holding, it is not right that through the accident of the circumstances that he is not working on his father's holding at the time of death, he should forfeit his entitlement to apply to the ALT for the holding. I believe that, on reflection, hon. Members would agree that that would be far too harsh and unfair a discrimination, and will see fit to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>can mean so many ifs and buts all along the line. If a man may leave the holding, and no one knows of his intention to get another job elsewhere, we come back to the position on which the Minister himself shot down his hon. Friend, the case of the man who goes to London and spends four or five years working there on an entirely different job, having given up all thought of farming again; but because the holding becomes vacant he thinks of coming back again. It is very difficult to draw a line. I agree with the Minister that a man may be working on another holding so as U broaden his agricultural experience, but is he to broaden it so far as to seek an entirely different kind of experience in a different kind of work altogether, and then to be allowed to come back to the holding?</p>

	<i>kk</i>) to the new clause, in subsection (3), leave out paragraph (
	<i>c</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>Amendment (
	<i>m</i>), in subsection 3(
	<i>c</i>), leave out "not" and insert "neither the owner nor".</p>

	<p>Amendment (
	<i>cc</i>), in subsection (3)(
	<i>c</i>) at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and his licence does not, by reason of section 2 of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948, take effect as if it were an agreement for the letting of the land for a tenancy from year to year".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On first consideration it seemed to me that paragraphs (
	<i>c</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>) were mutually exclusive. Even following my hon. Friend's remarks, it still seems to me that anyone who is covered by paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) is unlikely to be included in paragraph (
	<i>b</i>), if he is busily working on a commercial unit or is the occupier or holder of land within the meaning of the Act. I find it hard to understand how he can comply with paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) which provides that he must receive more than 50 per cent, of his income from his father's holding. Paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) seems to be redundant, but it is not to its redundancy that I wish to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have specifically excluded by paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) occupiers of commercial units who are doing what the Minister in replying to a previous amendment was seeking not to do, which is to preempt amalgamation. Paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) makes the amalgamation of tenanted holdings totally impossible. I cannot see why a son who occupies a commercial unit close to or neighbouring his father's commercial or sub-commercial unit, given the Government's amalgamation proposals in the past, should not be allowed to amalgamate the two holdings into a larger holding. We cannot differentiate between tenanted and owner-occupied holdings in this respect. If paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) is adopted we completely preempt any possibility of amalgamation by saying that the son cannot take over the father's holding. Even if it seems sensible to do so the son is precluded from doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difficulty in the assumption that the son's holding is necessarily the holding which he wishes to continue to
	<span class='label label-info column'>920</span>
work for the rest of his life. The father's holding may have been in family occupation for many years and there may be only one son. The option at least of a choice between his father's holding and his own holding should be open to the son, particularly if under paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) we are allowing non-commercial units to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am more concerned with the possibility of amalgamating two commercial units under the normal system of amalgamation. Here again we should give a degree of discretion to the tribunal. We should not take the view that what is good for the landlord is good for agriculture as we should do in a case covered by paragraph (
	<i>b</i>). The tribunal should have discretion to incorporate in one holding the holding of the father and of the son. That does not contravene what the Ministry have been trying to do over many years. By adopting paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) we should preclude that and preempt something which could be of agricultural benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to relate most of my remarks to Amendment (
	<i>cc</i>), but I wish first to make one or two comment about Amendment (
	<i>kk</i>). The hon. Member for Dudley, West (Dr. Phipps) has overlooked several matters. If two holdings in different ownership are amalgamated, many problems inevitably arise, perhaps not immediately but later. If hedges are bulldozed out and agricultural buildings are constructed how will the original two holdings be divided when ultimately the holding is taken in hand by the landowner?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that many tenant farmers already have tenanted land owned by different landlords. The problem has existed for many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, many tenant farmers rent land outside the holding of which they are the tenant, but those holdings have not been amalgamated, and the farmer will not involve himself in substantial capital expenditure either on the land or on agricultural buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all these debates Government supporters seem to overlook the fact that a farmer may give up his holding wBen his father dies and take over the holding previously tenanted by his father. By negotiation agreement can be reached by a tenant farmer to take over another
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0506">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>921</span>
tenanted farm. The hon. Member for Dudley, West seems to disregard human relationships.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is taking my point. What he suggests is specifically excluded by paragraph (
	<i>c</i>). I am trying to get the Minister to move away from that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment (
	<i>kk</i>) disregards the fact that an agreement can be reached privately between a tenant and a landowner outside the scope of this legislation. We do not want to widen the scope of this legislation because, as the Parliamentary Secretary said on several occasions, such a move might upset the delicate balance between tenant and landowner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to Amendment (
	<i>cc</i>). Section 2 of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948 refers specifically to the restriction on letting agricultural land for less than a tenancy from year to year. By some statutory magic Section 2 converts a licence to occupy land for use as agricultural land into a protected tenancy if
	<br><blockquote><p>"the circumstances are such that if his interest were a tenancy from year to year he would in respect of that land be the tenant of an agricultural holding"</p></blockquote>
unless it is a grazing agreement or a licence approved by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The section is somewhat obscure, but the courts have given it meaning and many a licensee gets the full protection of the 1948 Act under Section 2, even though it is not usually the intention of the parties concerned. Amendment (
	<i>cc</i>) seeks to ensure that a person who occupies a commercial holding as a licensee with the protection of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948 does not qualify as an eligible person entitled to apply for succession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A private arrangement outside this legislation is not affected by the amendment. Therefore, the circumstances wEich the hon. Member for Dudley, West seeks to provide can be covered, but it would be dangerous to widen the scope of the legislation because we do not want to upset the delicate balance that exists between landowner and tenant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These two provisions are not mutually exclusive. It is conceivable that a son is farming a farm which is less attractive than his father's holding. I do not understand why the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>922</span>
Dudley, West (Dr. Phipps) claims that the two paragraphs are exclusive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the reasons why the son may wish to move is because his holding is less attractive than his father's holding. We are preventing him from so doing by paragraph (
	<i>c</i>). The mutual exclusivity is between paragraphs (
	<i>b</i>) and (
	<i>c</i>). I cannot see how a person who is the occupier of a commercial holding under the 1967 Act can at -the same time fulfil the criterion of paragraph (
	<i>b</i>), which is that he shall derive his principal income from his father's holding. Mr. Benyon: If we accept the amendment and delete "or principal" the hon. Gentleman would be right, but as the wording is at present, "or principal"—which the Parliamentary Secretary was at great pains to explain meant more than half—would apply, particularly if the father's holding was much more lucrative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be misunderstanding the hon. Member for Dudley, West (Dr. Phipps), but he seems to be directing his attention to farms which could be physically united with a holding which he speaks of excluding. It is more likely that the son will have a holding some distance away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about where that could occur. I am also concerned about the possibility of the management of two separate holdings by the son. Farmers at present have the tenancies of holdings which are geographically apart but are managed as one unit. I can see no reason why that should not happen in this case, but it is precluded under paragraph (
	<i>c</i>). It is not just amalgamation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought the hon. Member was addressing himself entirely to amalgamations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause as it is at present drafted is correct so far as it goes. If somebody has another commercial holding he should not be entitled to be considered automatically for his father's holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody seems to have mentioned the auestion of Amendment (
	<i>m</i>). I hope the Minister will agree to Amendment (
	<i>m</i>), though I must admit, Mr. Costain, I am not sure what happens if paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) is taken out altogether. We
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>923</span>
shall not be able to discuss Amendment (
	<i>m</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member's assumption is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would address my short remarks to Amendment (
	<i>m</i>). If he is the physical holder of a viable holding, which is referred to here, then that son should not be considered for his father's holding. He and the tenant of another holding should be excluded. I am not sure why "neither owner nor" has not been included in the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to confine my remarks to Amendment (
	<i>m</i>). Here again, this is an amendment which, I hasten to say, I drafted myself. With the experience we had on the last one, which I also drafted, I am wondering whether the Government will accept this one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) is a part of this new clause which I think is right and should be left in the clause. If we are going on the one hand to say that the applicant must not be the occupier of another commercal holding it is reasonable to say that he should not be the owner of it and that is the purpose of Amendment (
	<i>m</i>). If we are talking about hardship and saying that we are just trying to deal with the hard cases, and we are saying that we are not going to give this opportunity of inheriting a holding to the occupier of another agricultural holding, it is clear that we should also exclude anyone who owns a holding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the provisions in this scheme which we have adopted from the family succession scheme in Scotland is that the tenant of a commercially viable holding should not be allowed to apply for the deceased tenant's holding, because hardship would not be present in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to keep at the back of our minds that the Government's motivation in introducing these new clauses is to avoid hardship, and to end the hardship which undoubtedly takes place. Even hon. Members opposite, with the exception of one hon. Member opposite, acknowledge that it takes place on some occasions—when the tenant of a farm d:es and the son who has been working on the holding is required to quit by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>924</span>
landlord; when he is served an incontestable notice to quit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has raised a fair point relating to the desirability in some circumstances of two farms being run together. I will avoid using the word "amalgamated".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would prefer to use that word to define physical amalgamation. My hon. Friend was fair enough to suggest that it would not necessarily be a farm absolutely adjacent to the one the applicant wants to succeed to. It may be a couple of tenanted farms two or three miles apart, where he wants to run them together and where it would make management sense to run them together. I can see the force of his argument and we have considered it carefully. We have decided, on balance, not to provide this discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason basically is that we feel the amalgamation point should be confined to a proper physical amalgamate of two units to create a viable one. By and large that is what we are talking about. If we were to bring in my hon. Friend's type of amalgamation, very often this would be basically unstable amalgamation. It might be temporary, perhaps only for a generation. Furthermore, I do not think there can be any argument that there is a clear distinction between that and the case for amalgamating two adjacent units physically to create a viable holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have decided, on balance, that, not only would it extend the clause further than we would like, but it would open a whole new area of discretion for the Agricultural Land Tribunal, because it would have to decide whether it would be practicable for the applicant to argue that he could run the two holdings together. I am not disputing that difficult decisions have to be taken by the Agricultural Land Tribunal, some as difficult as this, but we have decided, on balance, not to introduce a further concession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that reply. I accept the weight of the argument. Would my hon. Friend explain the substantial point about the tenant son who prefers his father's holding to the commercial unit he already occupies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>925</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. Friend acknowledged in his earlier remarks that, as the clause stands, if the applicant is occupying and working a holding other than the one of the deceased, then in normal circumstances he will not be an eligible person. If the applicant is still working on the holding and is deriving his principal source of income from the deceased's holding, then under the provisions as they stand he will not be excluded in those circumstances from applying. We are standing by this link with the holding. This is what the debate has been about. We have announced one important concession, the point about the situation where it is not reasonable to expeot an applicant to have a link with the holding, or at least to be working full time on the holding, when the tenant dies, but he will not be able to apply unless he has been working on the holding for five out of the seven years and deriving his principal source of income from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will now give the reasons why we cannot accept the amendment of hon. Members opposite. Let us take the situation where a son has acquired a holding. He is working on the farm of his father. He has acquired a holding, perhaps within the last three or four years, and his father dies. The holding might well be tenanted. It may be a holding from which the son derives no great income. In that situation it would be a mistake to exclude that son from applying and that would be the effect of the Opposition amendment. We are saying that if he is occupying and farming another commercial holding we feel there is no case for hardship. The question of ownership is a separate one. If we were to include that exclusion as well we could create real anomalies where relative hardship would be created. We have to strike a balance in these matters. In both respects the Government feel they have struck the right balance in this new clause and I hope hon. Members will accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman explain a bit more his aversion to " neither the owner nor". The words in Part II of the Agriculture Act 1967 exclude ownership of a non-viable holding. I do not see his objection to including those words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume the Parliamentary Secretary was saying that if he
	<span class='label label-info column'>926</span>
were an owner-occupier he would be excluded, but that only the owner-occupier of a viable holding would be excluded from applying for the tenancy of his father's farm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It would depend on whether he was occupying the holding. That is why I used the word "farmed". What we are saying is that where the individual is occupying the holding and actually farming it then he will be excluded, but where he happens to be the owner of the holding but not farming it—perhaps it is tenanted and he has been working on his father's farm—then in that situation he is not excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not press my amendment but I wish to make a general comment which, I think, will arise in other discussions we shall have in Standing Committee. This is the use of the word "hardship". It is a word which, I say with respect, the Government are introducing into our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the amendment was put down my hon. Friends and I myself were much more concerned with justice than with hardship. In moving the amendment I was addressing myself to the principle of justice. In future proceedings in Standing Committee I and many of my hon. Friends will be addressing ourselves to the principle of justice rather than to that of hardship. Hardship has been introduced by the Government rather than by ourselves in this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided</i>: Ayes 6, Noes 7.</p>

	<p>by hon. Members on both sides, about the rôle of the Agricultural Land Tribunals. There were some hon. Members, particularly on the Opposition side, who felt that there were very serious dangers in asking the Agricultural Land Tribunal to adjudicate on these matters, which are of the greatest moment.</p>

	<p>At the beginning of this debate it is as well again to point out that we are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>929</span>
discussing whether the tribunal should give to applicants the right of tenancy, remembering that it is a right worth very many thousands of pounds. There is no question that the decisions which are vested with the tribunal will frequently concern matters of £100,000 or more. Therefore, before these proposals leave Parliament, it is absolutely essential to ensure that the method of adjudicating is as fair as we can possibly envisage.</p>

	<p>Some hon. Members were concerned whether the Agricultural Land Tribunal was at all a suitable body to deal with these matters of hardship and great personal difficulties, which will arise either way. When these cases are considered there will be enormous disappointments for one party or another. Although we are dealing with a situation in which disappointments already exist on the death of a tenant, we should be deluding ourselves if we were to pretend that as a consequence of these debates we shall remove these disappointments altogether.</p>

	<p>Some hon. Members thought that an Agricultural Land Tribunal was entirely the wrong device for adjudicating on these matters. Some thought it would be better to have a judge, who would be able to use his much broader experience in coming to fair conclusions, sitting perhaps with some technical assistants. There has, therefore, been a good deal of discussion in the agricultural industry as to the best method of dealing with these disputes.</p>

	<p>It is fair to say that both the landlord-ing and the tenanting interests in the country have now come to the conclusion that it is better in the end to leave these matters with the Agricultural Land Tribunal. If it is the view of all parties in the country that the Agricultural Land Tribunal will come in general to a fairer resolution than could be achieved by other methods which have been suggested, we on our side are prepared to accept it.</p>

	<p>We have very grave doubts still whether the Agricultural Land Tribunals will be able to adjudicate on these matters in a way which will always be fair. We still believe that the momentous nature of the decisions which will have to be taken will stretch tribunals to the very limit.</p>

	<p>It is of great interest to look at the number of times the tribunals have met in recent years. The Parliamentary Secretary was kind enough, in a reply on Monday 8th March, to give me details
	<span class='label label-info column'>930</span>
showing how often the tribunals have been sitting. I quoted some of these figures in the debate on the Floor of the House. For instance, the Welsh tribunal has met only 21 times in the last five years. The East Midlands tribunal has also met only 21 times in that period. In my part of the world, the Northern tribunal has met 27 times, and the Yorkshire and Lancashire tribunal has met 29 times, in the same five-year period. Over five years no tribunal has met more often than the West Midlands tribunal, and it has met only 40 times. During 1975 it met only seven times. These are not busy tribunals, meeting every day of the week, and enormously experienced in dealing with these matters. If we are to ensure that the tribunals have every chance of reaching a fair decision, we should consider the composition of the tribunals.</p>

	<p>I have reminded myself of the provisions in the Agriculture Act 1947 which set up the Agricultural Land Tribunals. The Ninth Schedule indicates how the tribunals are composed. The chairman has to be a barrister or solicitor of not less than seven years' standing. I was somewhat concerned at one stage of the proceedings to ask myself who were the chairmen.</p>

	<p>Although I do not want in any way to be accused of being critical of some of the distinguished people up and down the country who take part in these activities, the truth is that some of them are held in high esteem and some are not. I have found this from a good deal of inquiry around the countryside. In one part of the country I was told by professional men that they never apply to the Agricultural Land Tribunal because they have so little faith in its decisions and its capacity to reach fair conclusions. It would be wrong of me to say where it is, but I will tell the Minister, who should be aware of these matters. I know other parts of the country where the chairman of the Agricultural Land Tribunal has taken immense trouble to ensure that he is as fully aware of the problems of agriculture as he could possibly be. My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, Southwest (Mr. Hawkins) has told me that he has the greatest confidence in the chairman of the East Anglia Agricultural Land Tribunal, and I am very glad
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>931</span>
to know that that is the case.</p>

	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>In that Ninth Schedule of the 1947 Act we come to the next grade of member, under paragraph 15. There are two other members, other than the chairman. Those two will be appointed by the Minister, and appointed from a panel of people nominated to represent the interests of farmers and of owners of agricultural land.</p>

	<p>Before becoming a Member of the House, I was a prominent member of the NFU, a member of the National Council, discussing in county branch meetings which members of the county branch executive might serve on these panels. It is true that the people appointed to the panel by the CLA and the NFU are farmers held in high esteem. Both organisations—I am a member of both—go to a great deal of trouble to ensure that farmers and landowners of great experience and wisdom are appointed to do this work, but the truth is that, by the nature of these people's experience, they have often never sat in a judicial or arbitration capacity before. People have told me, when they have had to serve, how difficult they find it to move into a position of an arbitrator or into a judicial capacity, never having had experience of such before. I can remember that when I became a Member of the House I had never before looked, except briefly as a student, at an Act of Parliament. Many of those on these tribunals who represent farming and land owning would go to their first meetings never having studied statutes or having had to discuss and examine matters which we here are forced to do when we are considering Bills and amendments to the law and so on.</p>

	<p>These tribunals are by no means universally satisfactory. People who serve on them are by no means experienced men or women who spend a vast amount of their time attending to that business. Whereas the additional two people are selected from a panel, it is not always the same two who are selected but usually rather the opposite. Different people are selected each time.</p>

	<p>In the last five years, for instance, the East Midlands tribunal has met only 21 times, an average of four times a year,
	<span class='label label-info column'>932</span>
and it would be interesting to know how many members of the panel have served only once during that five-year period. I suspect that there are a number of additional nominated members who have been members on only one occasion.</p>

	<p>My view, and that of many other people in the industry, is that a certain amount of stiffening and experience is needed in these tribunals. If we had people appointed on a regular basis to the tribunals, two assessors, this would provide stiffening because in that Schedule to the 1947 Act there is a provision whereby two assessors may be appointed. At present, assessors are rarely appointed. They are appointed from a panel produced by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and I have been told that, because the Minister has so rarely used his discretion under paragraph 16, the panel of the RICS has fallen almost entirely into disuse.</p>

	<p>These assessors would make extremely valuable permanent additions when the provisions of these new clauses are being considered by the ALTs. Men appointed as assessors would have a professional knowledge of the agricultural industry.</p>

	<p>No one would argue that the people who appear on the panel of the President of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors are not highly experienced and knowledgeable, not only about the practice of agriculture, but also about the law of agriculture and about the custom of agriculture. Those three things, practice, law and custom, are the three things which it is important to bring together, if one can, in the operation of these tribunals. Whereas the Minister may direct that assesors be added to the panel for the purposes of this provision, we should have these additional assessors in every case.</p>

	<p>Some may say that this would put up the cost. I suppose that that would be true. I am prepared to see that the cost of this type of judicial or semi-judicial arbitration is put up to a certain extent if we think it will arrive at a fairer answer in the end.</p>

	<p>I firmly believe that the experience of the assessors and their capacity to bring together practice, law and custom will be of great benefit. I hope that the Government will be able to accept this amendment. We discussed it at some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>933</span>
length on the Floor of the House, so that what I have been saying this morning has not been entirely new to the Government. The reaction of the Secretary of State for Wales was one of suprise when I pressed this, so I hope that, after a certain amount of thought, and considering the support of bodies which feel the same way as—that assessors would be extremely valuable additions to tribunals—the Government will be able to accept this amendment. It will mean that disputes will be much more satisfactorily disposed of. I hope the amendment will be accepted.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to be more than a few minutes, but the question whether a land tribunal is a suitable court is important. It is not a party political matter. In the interests of seeing the legislation carried out as expeditiously, fairly and cheaply as in any other way I can understand the Government's thoughts in referring this matter to the Agricultural Land Tribunal and their desire, as the Minister mentioned previously, to give the ALT something to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling), has quoted the answer to a parliamentary Question showing how little the ALT have had to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to be specific, because inevitably one would hurt feelings if one were too specific. My hon. Friend has touched on that. However, I had a conversation with a friend of mine who works a great deal in agricultural land-holdings legislation. He expressed grave personal doubts about the capacity of the ALT. His argument is that although the chairman is a qualified lawyer of seven years' standing or more—and in practice it tends to be much more—and he tends to be from a practice where, as much as possible, he deals in agricultural landholding law, the fact remains that experts in this field are few and far between. The Agricultural Law Association I think supports only 30 members or thereabouts, so that in the whole legal profession there are only 30 to 40 lawyers dealing with this specific part of the law every day. I understand that it is frequently necessary for those experts appearing before land tribunals to have to remind chairmen of points of law. That is understandable and esily ex-
	<span class='label label-info column'>934</span>
plained by the fact that these chairmen do not often in everyday practice come up against these problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also understand, I am sad to say, that a lot of litigation is employed where dissatisfied clients of country solicitors are frequently having to take their own solicitors to court for negligence over this complex law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will be prepared to consult the Agricultural Law Association and ask it if it agrees that the ALT is a suitable forum. I will not argue the matter, but if the Minister took proper soundings he would find an opinion that the ALT is not a suitable court to decide something which to a large extent will be crucial to both parties, concerning the possession of land over many years. We have debated that in this Committee before. I say, in no party vein whatever, that in the interests of fairness there might be a case for the Minister to look again to see whether these are the right courts to decide highly complex and contentious matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) has been persuasive, but I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be firm. For certain disputes, of course, the ALT is not the ideal place, but it is infinitely superior to the county courts. There is a question mark over some tribunals, but one gets that, too, in county courts. It was notorious in some areas that people would not go to the county courts because the judges had a certain prejudice. There are bound to be these feelings. This is a narrow field. These professionals tend to pass, as I have, to other areas of work, but there is a perfectly adequate process of appeal. It works well. One appeals to the divisional court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On my hon. Friend's other point, it is quite right that lawyers who appear should put the chairman right from time to time. It is their duty to do that. It is their duty to do so, but surely the assessors are the two additional members who are not meant to have any particular knowledge of the law. Of course all these matters are subject to law as well as to fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have thought that the Government have selected the right tribunal, but I would go along with the suggestion that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>935</span>
the constitution of the Agricultural Lands Tribunals should be reconsidered. I would hope that at a fairly early date the Government will reconsider how the constitution of those tribunals can be improved. Some of the chairmen are, perhaps, a little lacking in some of the qualities that are needed, and although I do not go all the way with the amendment, I believe there is some substance in the criticisms that have been advanced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My interest here to declare is that I am a chartered surveyor. I have had this matter brought to my attention, and I support my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) in this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would tell my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin), who says that the land tribunals have not been used a great deal, that this is because there is in the countryside, thank goodness, a general rule that one manages to settle these things out of court. I feel it is a good sign of those relationships between landlord and tenant that of the vast number of cases which at the present time can be referred to an Agricultural Lands Tribunal so few in number are referred, up and down the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that these new clauses will lead to an immense increase in the work that ALTs will have to do. It is for that reason that they should be strengthened, as my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) suggests. They need to be strengthened. Although in my area the chairman is somebody with an intimate knowledge of farming, because he is a farmer himself, being someone now retired from legal work, he is constantly consulted on particular points of agricultural law and able to give advice which other chairmen cannot. I understand that tribunals vary very much, mainly in chairmanship. That is natural, for one cannot expect to have the same sort of quality of person manning them all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether on this point my hon. Friend is aware that it is no coincidence that the tribunal which met more than any other during 1975 was in the Eastern area. It met 13 times, whereas some others met only two, three or four times. Probably, this demonstrates the point he is trying to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>936</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe my hon. Friend means that there they have great faith in taking matters to the tribunal. That may well be the case and probably is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must remember that under these new clauses the pressure on landlords' representatives and tenants' representatives will be far more, because so much of real interest, demanding real knowledge, is involved, and much more than was not involved before. Whereas one would have said that in 99 cases out of 100 landlords' and tenants' representatives have to be as impartial as they can, nevertheless they represent their own organisations. Here they will have rather more pressures upon them. This means that far more will be decided by the barrister who is the chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these barristers are undoubtedly impartial, but by no means all of them take a real interest in agriculture or understand its technical points. Now, since these questions will mean a lot of money in one way or another, a lot of value attaching to the decisions, counsel will be employed on each side. Under the Agricultural Land Tribunal procedure previously, cases were presented very often by the tenant's valuer and the landlord's valuer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is more than likely that my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston may not agree, but it is even more important that we should have sitting beside the barrister-chairman people who have had experience of what my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland described as an interest in all matters pertaining to the countryside, to landlord and tenant, customs and so on. I believe, therefore, that these assessors who, under the present law, are in addition to landlords' and tenants' representatives and can be appointed, should be appointed on every occasion. This would enable ALTs to come up with fairer and better decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these cases are now going to be strongly contested and hard fought. It is a great pity that in this way we shall introduce bad blood into the countryside. There will be, between different tenants, differences to be decided, and differences between various people who may be interested in having a tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the Minister will consider this very carefully with all the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>937</span>
interested bodies and those having an interest. I hope that among the hon. Gentleman's instructions, rules and regulations governing this matter there will be a strong recommendation to ALTs to employ assessors whenever possible or whenever the chairmen consider it necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All hon. Members who have spoken acknowledge that the chairman of the ALT at the present time has the option to appoint two assessors. The point of the amendment is simply to make this obligatory. Assessors come from a panel of professionally qualified men nominated by the President of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To reply briefly to the points that have been made, the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) will acknowledge that he used the opportunity to give a very wide-ranging and lengthy account of some of his experience as a member of the landed gentry—and I do not mean that in an unkind sense—as a farmer and a landowner. We all listened with great interest, but I believe he would acknowledge that some of the points he made, while they were of great interest to the Committee, do not call for a reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could pick him up on one important point, an understandable slip. He said that it was the Minister's fault that the panel of assessors had fallen into disuse and had become out of date. This is not so. The panel of assessors is the responsibility of the President of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The use of assessors is entirely at the discretion of the chairman. The Minister's powers to direct that assessors be used was repealed in the Agriculture Act 1958.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member argued that he felt chairmen should be required to appoint assessors in all circumstances. He would prefer not to take a hard line with regard to whether or not the ALT should do so. He acknowledge that while he had had personal reservations in the past, and continues to have them, these other organisations wanted to continue the use of the ALT as a forum for taking decisions in these matters, including the question of succession. The only hon. Member to dissent strongly from that view was the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin). His hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston
	<span class='label label-info column'>938</span>
(Mr. Body) replied very cogently, and I would subscribe very much to what he said. We can argue about the chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is striking that there has been an absence of official complaints about ALTs to the Minister of Agriculture or the Lord Chancellor. To some extent this may be because of the volume of work they have had. We may get more complaints in the future as they are put to greater use as a result of this legislation. Of course, we are always happy to look at such matters, and I am sure hon. Members will not hesitate to write should they know of instances in which they feel an ALT is consistently going wrong, though I must confess I can hardly countenance that situation happening. The hon. Member for Holland with Boston fairly argued that surely this was a better forum to decide these matters than, for example, a county court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Norfolk, Southwest (Mr. Hawkins) harped yet again on how amicably these matters were settled in the country. I do not dissent, but when he argues, as he and some others do in making these points, that these things have been amicably settled in the past, and that we are going to create bad blood in the countryside, I sometimes have a suspicion that what he really wants is that things should continue as they are, namely, that they be settled in such a way that when a landlord serves notice to quit on a tenant that is incontestable in law; and that things work out fine now because basically it is entirely the landlord who decides whether or not a son should succeed to a holding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made perfectly clear that there are cases of hardship, of which I have had personal experience. I have said I do not believe that hard cases make very good law, but I was quite prepared to see a case for the son to be considered to inherit. It is against a widening of the provision that I have set my face, because I believe it will lead to a lot of difficulties between families and others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is saying he is in favour of legislation which will give the son and perhaps another near relative a right to succeed in an application for the tenancy of a holding, I am glad, because he then goes some way with these new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>939</span>
I need say no more. Basically, we feel there are many cases where the ALT would find this business very simple. There will be difficulties, but it would be wrong to require the appointment of assessors in a case where it was known in advance that there would not be difficulty. We are in favour of encouraging them to use assessors where they think it necessary, but we do not wish to make it mandatory, and I hope hon. Members will agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must ask the Parliamentary Secretary to elaborate on his
	<span class='label label-info column'>940</span>
last words. He has said on the one hand he would like to encourage them to use assessors but he does not want to make their use mandatory. Will he tell the Committee whether he will do something about this? Would he be prepared to write to the chairman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
