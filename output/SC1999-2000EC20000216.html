	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce (Ms Patricia Hewitt)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to debate the future regulation of Europe's communications infrastructure and services. I remind the Committee how extraordinarily fast that whole area is moving. The markets already create about 15 per cent. of European Union gross domestic product and they are generating one in every four new jobs. The communications market and the information society will therefore have to drive Europe's single market and to reduce regional and social economic differences. It is thus essential that we get the framework right to deliver cheap and fast telecommunications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The telecommunications markets in Europe, with the exception of Portugal and Greece, were liberalised from 1 January 1998. The purpose of the package of measures that has been proposed by the Commission is to simplify, strengthen and update the regulation of the sector so as to ensure, first, that liberalisation is effectively implemented and secondly, that regulation is effective, consistent and light handed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has reviewed the package of measures to liberalise the market and offered its blueprint for a new regulatory framework. The two-month period for public consultation closed yesterday, but our Government have arranged that the formal United Kingdom response will not be delivered to the Commission until the Committee has had the opportunity to discuss the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new regulatory framework has to take account of competition and other changes since the markets were liberalised in 1998. That is why the review communication of last November drew on and was accompanied by several other documents, and why we have such a full pack for the debate this morning. We have the Fifth annual report on the Implementation of the the Telecommunications liberalisation package, the results of the consultation held on next steps in radio spectrum policy, the results of the consultation held on the convergence Green Paper and a report on the development of the market for digital television in the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will start with the fifth implementation report. Besides the review documentation itself, the Committee has particularly identified that report for debate. It looks at how member states have transposed the liberalisation directives into national law and how the rules have been applied in practice. The result is a comprehensive
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
assessment of a number of important regulatory themes: the structure and function of the national regulatory authorities—NRAs—licensing and interconnection, universal service, tariffs, numbering, radio frequency administration, rights of way and the state of competition in local access, which are all matters about which hon. Members are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report finds that since full liberalisation at the start of 1998, competition in national telecommunications markets has been more vigorous than many had expected. The evidence is to be seen in significant price reductions across a wide range of services, an increasingly large choice of new services and a number of new market entrants. To give a little flavour of the impact of that competition, a 10-minute local call costs on average 13 per cent. less than it did in 1997 and long distance calls have fallen on average by 30 per cent. Therefore, we see real benefits to consumers as a result of liberalisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission also identifies weaknesses that can be barriers, particularly for small businesses within the single market, and which need to be addressed in future regulatory framework. In particular, there is a low level of harmonisation between the licensing and interconnection regimes in different member states, divergence in how EC rules are implemented at national level, differences between the powers, resources and practices of the NRAs, poor enforcement of cost accounting rules, which can frustrate competition via interconnection and leased lines, lack of competition in local access, not only in the United Kingdom but right across member states—we are addressing that ourselves—and customers lack the leverage to complain effectively because tariff information is unclear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background and rationale for the Commission's regulatory framework review document, which is the next item on the agenda. The current regime has evolved over many years. It now contains more than 25 separate legal measures. It simply does not fit a new world in which markets are moving fast and broadcasting and telecommunications are converging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission advances five principles for the new regulatory framework. In future, regulations should be kept to a minimum; be based on clearly-defined policy objectives; strike the right balance between flexibility and legal certainty; evolve towards technological neutrality; and, whether they are agreed globally, regionally or nationally, they should be enforced as closely as possible in line with the activities that are being regulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following those principles, the Commission proposes a structure that will include some sector-specific directives, non-binding measures through guidelines and self-regulatory codes that would be consistent with the directives but allow a much faster response to market changes, and gradually greater reliance upon the general competition rules of the treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as the sector-specific legislation is concerned, the Commission proposes that five instruments will replace 20 current ones: the framework directive identifying specific policy objectives and four specific
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0882">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
directives eliminating provisions that are no longer necessary and setting limits for NRAs' discretion. The new framework would cover licensing, access to infrastructure—in other words, the local loop—and interconnection, universal service and privacy and data protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accompanying that would be the new "soft law" measures—the guidelines and codes of practice. That makes very good sense. In such a fast-moving market we need co-regulation wherever possible, with Governments working in close partnership with business and consumers. Indeed, I have just come from launching Trust UK, which is an example of such a co-regulatory approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next item to which we need to turn our attention deals with radio spectrum matters. It may help if I explain that the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on spectrum policy, which would form the basis for further harmonisation at Community level, is potentially wide-ranging. We fully share the objectives of rapid and effective action at EU level to secure spectrum harmonisation where major Community interests are at stake. However, we have told the Commission that we will examine carefully the specific proposals that it is likely to produce in the next few months. We welcome the fact that it has acknowledged the importance of the role of the CEPT—European Council for Post and Telecommunications)—, which is the 42 European-nation body, in international spectrum management and its desire to build upon rather than duplicate existing mechanisms. However, we want to ensure that any delegated authority for this purpose given to the Comission under the comitology procedures does not bypass the machinery of the European Parliament and Council of Ministers in areas that should properly be subject to political control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the Telecoms Council on 30 November 1999 I gave this regulatory blueprint a warm welcome, as did all my colleagues from other member states. We endorsed the five principles to which I have referred. The Telecoms Council will meet next on 2 May. At that point, we shall not have any new legislative instruments before us, but we shall need to react quickly to the report that the Commission will release in mid-April on its consultations about the future regime. This debate therefore provides a valuable and timely opportunity to sharpen the UK contribution to that process. We have exercised a leading and influential role in the development of EU thinking on convergent markets and it is essential that we keep up that work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 am at the latest for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and asked one at a time, please. There should be ample opportunity for all members of the Committee who wish to do so to ask more than one question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Duncan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rutland and Melton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for her opening remarks. By and large, we Opposition Members agree with the tenor of her comments—the wish to see continuing liberalisation and
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
increased competitiveness. The scale and significance of the communications changes are massive and we all appreciate that we are in the midst of an enormous revolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister briefly mentioned local loops, which are crucial to the speed of change and the access that more and more internet users will enjoy. What measures does she propose specifically to require local loop unbundling, not only in Britain but throughout the European Union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To start with the position in the United Kingdom, our regulator, Oftel, has reached an agreement with BT under which the local loop will be unbundled no later than July of next year. That is an extremely important measure providing the framework for the roll-out of asymmetric digital subscriber lines—ADSL—the new technology in the local loop that will increase its transmission capacity and is on track for the first 400 exchanges by next month.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oftel has made it clear that the reason for that timetable of July next year is that we have to go through a process whereby BT and the competing operators trial the process of co-location within the local district exchanges. That is not a trivial problem and it is important that we deal with the practicalities so that when local loop unbundling happens there are robust processes in place to ensure that competing operators can have their own engineers operating from within a single exchange and that roll-out happens smoothly. Oftel has also made it clear that if as a result of the pilots that are taking place this year it becomes possible to bring forward the July 2001 deadline, that will be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the rest of the European Union, the European Commission is itself proposing in a directive that local loop unbundling should be mandated across all member states. It has already been agreed in several member states and implemented in others and is the subject of consultation in many. We are all proceeding apace on the issue of local loop unbundling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Duncan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Minister rather concerned that, despite the Chancellor's bragging this morning to the newspapers about his agreement with Oftel, BT has now said that it knows nothing about it. It seems a curious way of proceeding that the main company involved should be unaware, when the Chancellor tells the public what he claims to have achieved. Exactly what are the Government doing at EU level to promote lower access prices to the internet? What is happening with the link between the EU and the United States of America in terms of the backbone that will be used for internet access across the Atlantic? Are there any mergers at the moment that give the Minister any concerns about undue monopoly control of that access?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speech that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor is making today sets out clearly what the Government and Oftel are doing in order to reduce the cost of internet access in this country. It is important to remember that for off-peak internet access our costs are among the lowest in the world. The problem arises with peak-time access. As a result of greater competition in the telecommunications market those costs are already
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0883">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
falling. BT has itself announced its new surftime product. The wholesale regime for surftime is now being discussed by BT, Oftel and the rest of the industry. Telewest has recently announced a new internet access regime at a flat rate of £10 a month. Those costs are falling fast.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor met David Edmonds, Director General of Telecommunications, yesterday. I am delighted that he did so and that in the speech that he is making today he will give his full backing to the action that Oftel has taken to ensure ADSL roll-out as rapidly as possible followed by the early achievement of local loop unbundling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards charges, not only in the UK but throughout the European Union, liberalisation in the European telecommunications market is bringing a rapid reduction in the cost of access. The European Commission—quite rightly, in my view—sees the continuing drive for liberalisation and greater competition as the way of securing that reduction in internet access costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also essential that the national regulatory authorities have the necessary powers, for instance in relation to local loop unbundling, which is the one part of the telecommunications system where there is not currently adequate competition in all member states. The NRAs need the power to drive through local loop unbundling in order to secure at that point in the system the reduction in costs that we have seen, for instance, in relation to national and international calls where there is considerable and growing competition between different telecommunications operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the backbone across the Atlantic and possible impending mergers. Any mergers would be a matter for either national or European competition authorities and it would certainly not be appropriate for me to comment on such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Duncan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister might explain to the Chancellor that there is an acute difference between backing Oftel and claiming credit for its decisions—a distinction that he may appreciate further by the end of the day. I must press her further, if I may, on the link between the EU and the USA. I accept that it would be improper for her to talk about any impending merger here, but is she satisfied at the moment that there is a fair, competitive structure governing access across the Atlantic?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly have not had any complaints about unfair competition in relation to transatlantic access. Enormous investments are being made in fibre optic links across the Atlantic, and those are increasingly being rolled out, not simply within the United Kingdom but across the European Union and indeed stretching into the Asia-Pacific region. Those fibre optic internet protocol backbones will enable the transmission of extraordinary volumes of data, far higher than anything that we are seeing at the moment or have seen in recent years. If there are concerns about anti-competitive behaviour or issues to do with interconnection regimes, those should be taken to the appropriate regulatory authorities where they will be properly dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that answer, many of the world's largest telecommunications companies are now European companies and will require free access to spectrum in markets outside Europe. Is the free access to spectrum for non-European companies, which these plans will give in Europe, reflected in other markets that Europeans may want to get into? If not, will we implement the plans in such a way as to strengthen our negotiating position for access into those other world markets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an extremely interesting and pertinent point. We, the European Union and the Commission take the view that there should be non-discriminatory access to radio spectrum. We believe that that will enable us to create a highly competitive market at the leading edge of technological development, which will bring very large benefits to European consumers and business. Because in Europe we have a proper system of spectrum management and we have harmonised spectrum allocation, we are way ahead—probably by two years or more—of the United States in mobile telephony. The United States failed to deal with the issues of interoperability and spectrum allocation and thus has not been able to take full advantage of mobile telephony because one cannot use the same system across a variety of different states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ironically, we found at the last Telecoms Council that there had been some correspondence between the Commission and the American Government on access to the European spectrum. The suggestion was being made by the American authorities that the way in which spectrum was being allocated for third generation mobile in Europe might discriminate against American operators seeking to enter the European market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As member states, we all strongly backed the Commission's response to the American authorities, but it is scarcely appropriate for them to complain about non-existent barriers to entry into the European market, when we are still trying to obtain proper access for European operators to American markets. We will continue, as will the Commission, to prosecute that issue with considerable vigour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Loughton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Worthing and Shoreham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I first declare an interest in an internet company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the Minister's comments about telecommunications competition in Europe being more vigorous than expected, does she agree that in future we should perhaps rely more on competition law and less on sectoral regulation when dealing with telecoms companies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The relationship between general competition law and sector-specific telecommunications regulation is an interesting issue that we must grapple with at international and European level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom Government's view is that we should move towards greater reliance on general competition law and that, as telecommunications markets are opened up and become more competitive, there is less need for sector-specific regulation. When the Director General of Telecommunications published his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0884">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
strategy last month, he made it clear that he intends to lighten the regulatory touch as markets become more competitive, but in some circumstances a sector-specific approach may still be required—for instance, in relation to universal service or to issues such as leased lines, local loop unbundling and roaming, which are utterly specific to the telecommunications sector, where a great deal of sectoral and technical knowledge is needed and where, as we said in relation to the local loop, competition does not yet exist, so that, particularly on interconnection, the regulator must ensure that competition is opened up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As that greater competition is achieved, as it has been in the mobile telephone market, spectrum allocation issues need to be dealt with only as long as there is spectrum scarcity and spectrum must be allocated to allow efficient operation and give proper economic value. One does not need a sector regulator to deal with interconnection pricing issues in the way that one still does for the local loop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As our national sector regulator, Oftel will make full use of the competition powers in the Competition Act 1998 when they come into force next month. It is not a question of having either competition law or the sector regulator: the two can go together, but driving in the direction of greater reliance on general competition law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Joan Walley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In welcoming my hon. Friend the Minister's statement to the Committee, I refer her to the Community policies related to radio spectrum and to chapter 2 of the document, which talks about the relationship of radio spectrum to other EU decision-making processes. What account are the Government taking of sustainability and of the precautionary principle in respect of the harmonisation of different policies? What further research will she ask the European Union to carry out on low-energy electromagnetic fields, particularly in regard to the siting of telecommunications masts? Clearly proper harmonisation is necessary, so that some countries do not lose out because they do not introduce the precautionary principle in relation to the siting of such masts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that important issue, because there is concern about possible threats to health from low-level radiation. The National Radiological Protection Board, our national body that deals with these issues, has confirmed that there is no scientific evidence to support the proposition that, except in the narrow band around the mast, there is any threat to health from low-level radiation. However, we have already established the Stewart committee to conduct an independent review of all the scientific evidence so that the Government can ensure that our policy is based on the best available scientific evidence. It is for the telecommunications operators and the local authorities to ensure that radio masts are properly sited and access to the immediate vicinity properly barred. A regime is in place that deals adequately with the health issues, but the Stewart review will ensure that we have the best possible scientific evidence, which we shall want to discuss with our European partners in the context of the new telecommunications framework.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister a little further on the competition aspect? I appreciate that the Competition Act 1998 has not yet come into effect and that we are simply applying the European competition framework, but the industry feels that the original 1998 liberalisation framework has not worked and is not boosting competition sufficiently and that monopolies still exist in all but name. The companies that had a public monopoly continue to be the big guys across the European market.

Is the Minister satisfied that the documents allow for sufficient competition and for regulatory intervention that would be proportionate to the prospects of competitive entry for smaller players and new entrants to the market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I believe that the proposals will provide an adequate framework, but I stress that the United Kingdom has a highly competitive telecommunications market. Clearly, there is not competition within the local loop, although there is competition from the cable operators and, increasingly, from mobile telephone operators. That is why national and international call charges have fallen very fast.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mobile telephony market is also highly competitive. Because the Radiocommunications Agency has been able, with great technical ingenuity, to determine that five licences will be available within the third generation spectrum, we have been able to ensure through its design that there will be at least one new entrant into the third generation mobile market, a move that is being watched with great interest by our European partners. Certainly the former monopoly operator is by no means the dominant player in the mobile telephone market or the market for international call charges: it has significant market power, but it is not in the same position as it is in relation to the local loop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The picture will vary from one member state to another, depending in part on the speed of liberalisation in those countries, but the Commission is clearly determined to drive through implementation of the liberalisation directive, and its review process is very powerful. Moreover, it is putting in place a framework that will ensure that the national regulatory authorities have the powers that they need and work increasingly closely together with a consistent use of consistent powers. That, in turn, will help to give operators, who will increasingly be pan-European, the certainty that they need across the emerging single telecommunications market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be making a speech later and I am not sure whether this is the appropriate time to declare an interest, but I should point out that I advise the Telecommunication Managers Association, and have shares in Cable and Wireless Communications and BT. That is rather sad, given that the value of those shares is declining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister about jurisdictional issues arising from regulation between Europe and the United Kingdom. The hon. Lady said that everyone in the UK agrees that regulation will be reduced, but the Utilities Bill, which is being considered in Committee, includes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0885">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
27 pages of new primary legislation that will introduce regulation-making powers for various social issues. Will Europe allow us to implement such legislation in our own jurisdiction?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A more pressing issue is spectrum management. It is undertaken by agreement with Europe, and rightly so, but the UK intends to auction its allocation. Will the UK be allowed to keep the proceeds, or will Europe say, "Where's our money for our spectrum?" Moreover, an individual company that operates primarily on mainland Europe may argue that it is being unfairly discriminated against because it has to pay a large sum to participate in spectrum. Will the Minister comment on that, and in particular on the jurisdictional relationship between Europe and the UK?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not allow anti-European paranoia to run away with the debate. There is no question of the European Commission trying to get its hands on the fruits of the spectrum auction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the jurisdictional issue that the hon. Gentleman raises poses a real problem. There is an EU framework for competition law and telecoms regulation of which we must take account. In many cases, we have to translate international law or action into sector-specific directives. Legislation that covers matters covered by European law is compatible with European law. For example, the Electronic Communications Bill, which has recently completed its legislative passage through this House, will among other things implement the European Union directive on electronic signatures. We would have enacted the Bill in any case, but it also brings into force that directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the European Commission makes it clear that, wherever a policy is set—and it will be set at different levels according to what the policy is—the implementation of regulation should be as close to the operators as possible. That is why it has rightly rejected calls for a European telecoms regulator. Such a regulator is not on the agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On spectrum management, decisions on which part of spectrum to allocate to which purpose are taken at a wider than EU level. They are taken within CEPT but, through the Commission, EU member states effectively speak with a single voice, ensuring a satisfactory result. However, allocation of that spectrum is a matter for national authorities. In respect of proposals for the new telecoms framework and the way in which spectrum should be made available, the Commission has changed its position markedly in the past two years, and I welcome that. As the hon. Gentleman said, we are auctioning third generation spectrum. Two years ago, the Commission was hostile to the idea of auctions and believed that administrative allocation—or so-called beauty contests—was the proper way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that in the context of third generation mobile, which involves a limited amount of very valuable spectrum, an auction provides the best way of securing the most economically efficient outcome, because it allows the market players, rather than the Government, to decide the value of the spectrum. Not only does the European framework allow us to use
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
auctions where we decide that it is the right thing to do, but, interestingly, other Governments are increasingly doing the same. For example, the Dutch Government have already announced their intention to use an auction for spectrum allocation, and the German Government are likely to use an auction for their third generation mobile allocation, which will follow shortly after ours. Other member states are looking to our experience and expertise in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we welcome the Commission's suggestion, in its proposed new framework, that it should in future permit spectrum trading. That is not currently permitted under European law, but we believe that in certain circumstances it can offer a simple, efficient, market-based mechanism for the further allocation of scarce spectrum. We want to be able to use it here, and welcome the fact that the European Commission is proposing a change to the European regime that will allow us to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Loughton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the fruits of auction, as the Minister put it, the major beneficiary will be the Treasury. Will she comment on the revenue that the Treasury raises from the allocation of band widths and third generation licences for mobile telephone companies, for which I gather that the rates were increased? Does she believe that that has implications for competitiveness in the UK—where it could act as a barrier to entry, especially for smaller players—or the European Union? Does she believe that the technology tax of a digital television licence fee has any competitiveness implications in a European context?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The third generation spectrum auction involves no risk to our competitiveness; quite the contrary. It enables the 13 competing operators that have indicated their intention to bid for the spectrum to decide for themselves the value that they place on each of the licences that we are auctioning. The focus of spectrum allocation is not to maximise revenues to the Treasury, but to ensure the most economically efficient allocation of an extremely scarce resource.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that it will be too expensive and prevent new operators entering the market represents a misunderstanding of the nature of the market. An operator that cannot afford to pay for the spectrum is unlikely to be able to afford the infrastructure investment—in masts and so on—that will be required to use the third generation spectrum. The cost of the spectrum itself is a small part of the investment that mobile operators will make in exploiting the extraordinary potential of third generation spectrum. Anyone who suggests that the Government should set an administrative price in preference to allowing the market to decide, or that we should simply give the spectrum away, clearly does not understand that the auction is the best way to allow market operators and entrants to value the spectrum for themselves and to ensure that the operators that secure the licences have the resources to make the necessary investment to exploit their value. The route that we are taking will enhance competition and competitiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The digital licence is being considered by the Government in the light of the Davies report, and no decision has yet been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talked about minimum regulations for telecoms in her opening remarks, and I am sure that most members of the Committee agreed with her. Will she say more about the document's impact on digital television, terrestrial television, digital free-to-air television and pay television? Regulation of telecommunications traditionally involved a light touch and increasingly does so, but regulation of broadcasting has been of a different calibre and is based on standards. That was all very well when there was a clear separation between telecommunications and broadcasting, but recently there has been convergence between those sectors. What weight has the Minister given to the appropriateness of regulation or the use of competition law in respect of that cross-over point between telecommunications and broadcasting?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What involvement did the Department for Culture, Media and Sport have in the preparation of the Government's response? Additionally, I want to ask—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I said that it was acceptable to ask one question, but the hon. Gentleman is asking a series. I shall be happy to call him later if he wants to raise further matters, but the Minister must have an opportunity to respond to the points that he has already raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Butterfill. I hope that I can remember all the questions that the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) asked. He raised an important issue. The Commission will use the 1999 communications review to consider the appropriate regulatory framework for infrastructure. That will include a consideration of the regulatory framework for the spectrum that is currently allocated to broadcasting. Audiovisual content issues will be considered in a separate but parallel exercise. The Commission's communication on audiovisual policy in the digital age suggested that the same regulatory principles that apply to infrastructure should also apply to audiovisual content. Parallel reviews on infrastructure and on content are under way and both accept the five general principles of good regulation that I mentioned earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Trade and Industry and for Culture, Media and Sport and I recently announced that we shall undertake a joint review, which will be run by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. It will examine the regulatory framework for broadcasting and telecommunications and it will take account of the convergence to which the hon. Gentleman referred. During that review, which will culminate in a White Paper that will probably be published in the autumn, we shall consider the extent to which we should rely on general competition law, how much we require a sector-specific regulator or regulators, what the nature of that sector is and whether, and how, we should separate content regulation from economic regulation. Those matters are being pursued at the European and United Kingdom levels in a way that takes account of the rapidity of technological change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Loughton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned that technological neutrality was a guiding principle. What does that mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had great fun discussing that matter when we discussed the Electronic Communications Bill in this Committee Room. The principle in essence is that we should not try to regulate for one particular technology. Regulation, and primary legislation especially, should not be directed merely to asymmetric digital subscriber line, for example. In the Electronic Communications Bill we were at pains to ensure that we did not regulate for public key infrastructure, which is only one of the ways in which we can ensure authentication and confidentiality. Once broadcasting, voice telephony and mobile telephones converge into a single digital stream that can be carried on wires and wireless networks, it will be necessary to abstract from particular technologies to formulate our regulatory goals and principles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister had an opportunity, during her time at the Department of Trade and Industry, to organise an audit of spectrum currently used in the UK? As she referred to the cost of internet access, has she made cost comparisons, especially in relation to unmetered access—often called "free"—as it operates in Canada, the USA, Finland, Sweden and other countries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of spectrum audit, spectrum management is a matter for the Radiocommunications Agency, which reports to the Department of Trade and Industry. I am not quite sure what the hon. Gentleman has in mind in terms of a spectrum audit. The allocation and use of spectrum is a matter of public record. The Radiocommunications Agency is always looking for ways of securing a more efficient allocation of spectrum, to ensure, for instance, that dominant users such as the Ministry of Defence do not end up cornering more of the spectrum than is necessary. We are one of the few countries that charge our defence ministry, along with all other operators, for the spectrum that it occupies. That is an effective incentive to efficient use of spectrum. The allocation and efficiency of spectrum use is under constant review by the agency, and by the spectrum management advisory group, which is a group of independent experts who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0887">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
advise the RA—its chief executive is a member of the group—and Ministers on how to continue to improve spectrum allocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of internet access, we commissioned an international benchmarking study, the results of which were published last September in the Cabinet Office paper, "e-commerce@its.best.uk". It found that the costs of off-peak internet access—weekend and evening—for those who use one of the subscription-free internet service providers that are common in this country are among the cheapest in the world, but for peak-hour access, which is especially important for small businesses, our costs are above average. Those costs are too high. The Government have said for some time that we want those costs to fall to the level of, say, those in the United States. We want a much wider range of tariff packages, such as unmetered access, which would provide unlimited use of the internet for a flat-rate monthly subscription. That is precisely what the Telewest and BT Surftime packages will deliver. The best way of achieving lower costs and unmetered access flat-rate tariff packages is to continue to encourage competition and to unbundle the local loop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This question may have been dealt with in the documents, but I have not found the answer. How will the Minister deal with cross-border broadcasting? My constituency is closer to Belgium and France than to London. Kent could use services supplied by a broadcaster in France, where the appropriate radio frequency might be cheaper at auction than it would be in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has caught me out. He has raised a fascinating question. Certain geographical areas have an advantage in that they have access to other countries' broadcasting as well as to their own, and therefore have a greater choice as a result of a happy geographical accident. The national regulators need to look at cross-border issues, which may need to be taken into account within the European Commission framework. However, I am not certain whether these documents refer to that question. I do not recall a reference to it, but I shall write to my hon. Friend on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Loughton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister bringing pressure to bear on telecoms providers in relation to transparency of tariffs? My last BT bill amounted to eight or nine pages, with all its schemes such as friends and family, phone a friend, phone an enemy, and so on. It was impossible to work out whether I was better or worse off, so I wrote to the chief executive of BT to ask him whether I was paying more. The system has become highly complicated. If I cannot understand it, I am sure that many of my constituents cannot either, which confuses the issue further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am distressed to hear that the hon. Gentleman is struggling with his bills in that way. I have found the transition from the old bills, which gave only the total and the value added tax, to the new, detailed, itemised bills exceptionally useful. I can now see exactly what my children's telephone calls are costing me. The amount is horrifying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
However, the issue of transparency of tariffs is a serious one, involving the ability of consumers to compare different operators' tariffs in order to decide which will be best for them. I believe that Oftel has recently taken the helpful step of publishing comparability data, making it easier for different users to see which operator can offer the best deal on, for example, a certain number of calls with a particular split between peak time and off-peak. Oftel is encouraging the industry towards greater transparency and publishing its own comparisons. That exerts a powerful pressure on the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relative merits of specific offers such as friends and family are not as important as the question whether one can reduce one's total bill by shifting to a different operator for some or all of one's calls. That is what consumers really need to know; our national regulator is moving in that direction, as is the European Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on some rather puzzling issues in the Utilities Bill? She said that she envisaged Oftel becoming part and parcel of a wider communications agency, yet the Bill proposes massive changes to Oftel that do not address that issue. The Government want to carry out a complete review, and it seems strange that such changes to Oftel are being proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the hon. Gentleman to address his questions to the document under discussion. The Committee is not considering the Utilities Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me rephrase my question, Mr. Butterfill. The documents under discussion seem to be in conflict with the provisions of the Utilities Bill. I would be grateful if the Minister would say why these documents, rather than the Bill, represent the correct version.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about how the local loop is to be owned. The Government have decided that the infrastructure of the water and electricity systems should be owned by separate companies, even if they have the same shareholders, but that approach has not been taken in relation to BT's ownership of the local loop. Will the Minister throw some light on those issues, in relation to the documents before us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those ingenious questions. There is no conflict between the approach outlined here and the provisions of the Utilities Bill. If I may have a sentence on the Bill, Mr. Butterfill, its intention is to improve the regulation system that we inherited from the previous Administration and to move from a single regulator to a collective body to get rid of some of the personalisation of regulatory issues and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also considering—the White Paper on this will not be published until the autumn—how we should move the regulatory regime forward to cope with the increasingly converging industries of broadcasting and telecommunications, where eight or nine different regulators deal with different aspects. We have not yet decided on the best regulatory framework, but if we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0888">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
decide to establish a single communications regulator that covers a broader sector than Oftel does, I imagine that the principles enshrined in the Utilities Bill will apply to the new regulator too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like virtually all the national regulators in other countries, Oftel is considering local loop unbundling as a means of achieving competition in the local loop. Different mechanisms may be appropriate in different utilities to achieve competition, or they may be necessary because competition cannot be achieved within a single pipe. It is possible for all competing operators to have access to that local loop. Therefore, telecoms does not require the same approach—it varies from country to country—as for water or gas. That would be a distraction from the aim to get competition into the local loop and expand its capacity so that we can deliver cheap broad band into people's homes. That is the goal, and everything else is a means to that end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Commission was considering, eight to 10 years ago, how the telecoms market would move, it thought that two or three international companies would cover the whole of Europe. In the UK, we had a large number of small companies. Can the Minister comment on how the Government will ensure that UK-based companies get access in the European market? Clearly, the takeover of Mannesmann by Vodafone is a case in point, but I understand that many companies that have tried to do deals with local people who are not necessarily operators in a particular market place have found it difficult to get the necessary licences to operate. What are the Government doing about opening up and liberalising the European market for enterprise to go in and provide services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ownership of the local loop is not a matter for the European Union anyway, because property ownership is reserved to member states under the treaty. Clearly, as the hon. Gentleman has rightly demonstrated, access to other European markets is opening up quickly. To ensure that British operators have access to those markets, we are backing the Commission's rather successful efforts to enforce liberalisation of telecommunications markets in every member state and to ensure that the national regulators have the necessary powers and apply them consistently. Where the European Commission thinks that specific action is needed—for instance on the local loop—we shall back specific legislation through a directive. We are seeing a pretty rapid opening up. I meet an increasing number of British-based companies that are making significant investments in Germany and other countries. BT itself is in partnership with telecoms companies in the other key member states, to expand its activities across the European market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister comment on the roll-out of digital television? As she will know, one of the aims of having everyone switch to digital is to free up the analogue spectrum. It appears that things are moving more slowly than expected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not share the hon. Gentleman's view that things are moving more slowly than expected. We are seeing a pretty rapid take-up of digital television.
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Indeed, recent figures suggest that its use is growing even faster than that of telephones, television, mobile phones and computers. Although the take-up curve for those new technologies is constantly rising, we have set two demanding tests—availability and affordability—that must be met before we switch off the analogue signal and convert fully to digital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ducan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee, because the relevant ground has been covered during questions, but I must do what I should have done earlier, which is to declare an interest of a sort. It is fully recorded in the register that I advise a middle eastern company on telecoms matters. Such activity has no bearing on our discussion but, for the sake of good order, I felt that I should mention it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As is well known, Opposition Members of the Committee favour competition over regulation. It is clear that the Government are moving in that direction, although I fear that they remain overly wedded to regulation and are not sufficiently keen on competition. Nevertheless, I hope that not only the UK but the whole of the European Union move in that direction as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made clear her support for spectrum trading, which is very welcome. A market in licence rights—a form of secondary market—and rights granted to companies that might have won something in an auction is a positive move. It is very good news, because it will help this important and fast-moving market to mature in a way that the past climate of regulation has not permitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that, since the privatisation of BT and the continuation of the information technology revolution, prices have fallen significantly and progress has been made. That contrasts with what she and her fellow Ministers have said about rip-off Britain. Competition has proved a great success and long may it continue to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was a pleasure to listen to the Minister's response to our questions. Opposition Members are pleased that the work that we did in government has been so substantial and successful that Ministers are only too pleased to take all the credit. The Minister responded to most of the questions in a way in which I would have expected a Conservative Minister to respond. In saying that sincerely, I hope that I am not damning her career; in fact, some might suggest that I am promoting it. I have already asked some questions and we have had a good discussion on many of the issues that I wanted to raise, particularly spectrum and spectrum management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one wanted to have a gold mine in this country, there would have to be a few seams of gold. In the same way, if one wants to use electronic commerce, how one proceeds with the management of spectrum, which is a scarce resource, is vital. It cannot be manufactured, although it is being used increasingly efficiently and cleverly. As the Minister said, the radio agency is the manager of spectrum and reports to the DTI. However, if she conducted an audit, she would discover that the two big users of spectrum—which have it allocated in such a way that the radio agency cannot get its hands on it—are the BBC and the Ministry of Defence. We should look much more carefully at what is happening in that respect. Bowman has not been particularly successful, so the MOD is using American communications systems, among others. Generally speaking, the greater the variety of systems that one needs, the more spectrum one needs. An important factor in that context is reserving spectrum for times of warfare, when it could be switched off by order and utilised in other ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Treasury has accepted that there is a lot of money to be made from spectrum, and I warn the Minister—or perhaps advise is a better word—that we all know that it wants to do so. All sorts of spin and justification can be advanced as to how that is done, but we must remember that every pound that is collected from a company that is going to deliver third generation mobile, or whatever it may be, will be paid for by the consumer. One of the Prime Minister's stated aims is to make the UK the best place to conduct electronic business. We have seen that if the costs for accessing and using the technology are set at the lowest in the world, we can attract jobs that are nothing to do with IT or electronic commerce, but are the add-on jobs that result from being able to do business more cheaply in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to my earlier question, the Minister told us what we already know—that at certain times of day this country is as cheap, or cheaper than, anywhere else for dialled-in access to the internet. In fact, I was asking the Minister about the cost of unmetered calls. When the parliamentary information technology group visited Canada, we found that ADSL was available through a telephone company, which already had the loops there. It was priced at only $10 a month for 24-hour-a-day access, which included all sorts of add-ons—telephony, ordering, systems and information—without any premium rates being involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I have challenged BT about that and am awaiting its response. When BT offers such services, it refers to off-peak areas when it is cheap to get online anyway and the cost is a multiple of $10, with 24-hour access costing probably well over £50 a month. To an ordinary householder, that is a lot of money, although that may not be so in the case of someone who is running a small business from their home, or using their home as another office. The systems are not being opened up in the way that we are entitled to expect. BT had the integrated services digital network, which gives reasonably fast access to the internet, a long time before anyone else. However, the cost involved meant that it was not rolled out as it should have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government need to tackle that problem. It is all very well for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announce on television that he has had a word with Oftel, which will ensure that internet access is set at half its current rate, but Oftel does not have the power to do that. He was talking to the wrong person. The people who have the power to ensure that we have lower prices are the chairmen of BT and the other companies. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Whip seems to think that this is not in the documents. Clearly he has not read them, because the Minister knows that those are precisely the issues that we are dealing with. If we are to be successful in Europe and throughout the world, we must ensure that we have low-cost access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take my hat off to the cable companies, which have been driving down unmetered access to the internet. A great deal should be said about them: let us shame BT into getting in there. As a shareholder of BT, I see my shares going down and down. I suspect that, if the company provided a product that everybody rushed out to buy, shareholders and customers would be delighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other small factor is that all the documents fly in the face of the provisions in the Utilities Bill. I say to the Minister with all sincerity that, when the previous Government privatised BT, we were told that it was a natural monopoly: it could not be split up; we could not get competition. It has been a hard road to get that competition going. Let us not argue about who is doing what and who is moving fastest, but it is starting to happen. For the Government to introduce the Utilities Bill and say that now that we have competition in the local loop, we should add more regulation is to fly in the face of what our European partners are doing. After all, they are deregulating only because the UK led the way. They have seen the growth in our industry and the fact that companies come to the United Kingdom, so they have adopted our model.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister keeps talking about joined-up government. Will she please, as the electronic Minister, the e-envoy from this Committee, go back and tell her hon. Friends in the Committee considering the Utilities Bill that we can chop 27 pages out of it straight away? We can then deal with the telecoms side when the White Paper is published in the autumn and move towards a deregulated system. When she chopped great lumps out of the Electronic Communications Bill the Conservative party was only too pleased to let it be implemented immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a wonderfully brief and very interesting debate. I want to make a few remarks—first about competition. It is perhaps a little unfair, but we all remember that the initial attempt at hybridising telecommunications and creating a duopoly did not get us very far. Things have moved on pretty rapidly since then. It was this Government who introduced the Competition Act 1998, which comes into force next month. That Act will give this country a powerfully pro-competitive legal framework and represents a major advance on what we inherited from the previous Government. It was this Government who, in 1998, took the step of consulting on spectrum trading and found a consensus in the industry for the approach that we recommended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) raised the important issue of the spectrum that is allocated to the broadcasting authorities and the MOD. I have already addressed the way in which we achieve new universal availability and a high take-up of digital television on whichever one of the three platforms individual consumers prefer, so that we can switch off the analogue signal for television and free up more of that valuable spectrum. I have worked closely with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and with the broadcasting industry to find more effective ways of helping consumers to understand the benefits of digital broadcasting in order to promote an even more rapid take-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Military use takes up some 40 per cent. of the spectrum in the UK, which raises an important issue not only for us but for other European countries. The context for defence has changed significantly since the end of the cold war, but the military need for spectrums has not reduced markedly. Modern warfare places a high premium on mobility and on the instantaneous and highly efficient communication of large volumes of data. High band width mobile communications are therefore becoming increasingly important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much military training that is carried out by United Kingdom forces in Europe is now conducted at home, which places even greater pressure on the band width that is allocated to the MOD. The MOD keeps its spectrum requirements under review, and I am glad to say that the Radiocommunications Agency and the MOD agreed sharing arrangements under which we can make military spectrums available to civil services, on a shared or an exclusive basis, subject to overriding military use in an emergency. That is a sensible and practical way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike many other countries, we charge the MOD for the spectrum that it occupies. We already have in place an efficient pricing incentive which should encourage the MOD to make its use of spectrum as efficient as it can and to make shared use arrangements when it is possible to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the cost of unmetered calls, the hon. Member for South Dorset referred to ISDN. That is a classic example of what happens when one backs one kind of technology
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
that does not work out especially well. It shows the need for technological neutrality, which is preferable to saying, "Here is the technical answer to all our problems. Let's go hell for leather for it." BT is making a substantial investment in ADSL and in the local loop. The first 400 exchanges will come on-line next month and an aggressive roll-out programme will follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The retail costs of ADSL have not yet been announced by BT, but we need to consider the cost of leased lines. At a recent Select Committee hearing, the Director General of Telecommunications said that in retrospect he felt that Oftel had not pursued the matter sufficiently aggressively. It is now making rapid progress in relation to benchmarking and the cost of leased lines. It is hard to obtain accurate comparisons because of the different distances that lines run and the different band width capacity of those lines. Accurate comparisons will allow us to benchmark the United Kingdom and to establish what action should be taken to reduce costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation varies from country to country, partly because the technical infrastructures are different. Most states in the United States, for example, moved early on to an unmetered pricing structure, which had implications for the capacity that needed to be built into the local loop. We are in a different position: we do not have as much capacity in the local loop as we should like in order to sustain unmetered, always-on access to the internet. That is why ASDL and local loop unbundling are so important. Oftel is putting much time and resources into getting the matter right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, it is increasingly clear that in the new knowledge economy, the radio waves that surround us, which are an invisible resource, are one of the most valuable of raw materials. Services, products, jobs and entire industries can be built using that resource. We are a world leader in spectrum management. The Commission acknowledged that our spectrum strategy, which was published by the Radiocommunications Agency, is a model.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end by paying tribute to the Radiocommunications Agency and to Oftel, and to their directors, for dealing highly effectively with these complex and technical issues, which have been the subject of an interesting and valuable debate this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
