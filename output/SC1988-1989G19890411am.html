	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opening the discussion of part V, I will make a few general comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicombe committee highlighted the use of companies by local authorities to carry out certain activities. The committee recommended that the law relating to local "authority-controlled companies should be amended to make it clear that they should be set up only when there is specific enabling legislation and that there should be safeguards relating to their articles of association, membership, audit and reporting arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicombe committee recommended in paragraph 8.115 of its report that the case for companies needed to be considered in the
	<br><blockquote><p>"context of a detailed appraisal of the requirements of the service in question".</p></blockquote>
However, the committee did not consider it within its remit to do that. Morever, the commitee saw the examination as being appropriately considered within the framework of an examination of
	<br><blockquote><p>"the proper role of local authorities in economic development".</p></blockquote>
The Government, while carrying out a survey of the use of companies, failed to consider this in the context of the delivery of service—that is, economic development. The two were dealt with separately. Thus, there was a failure to recognise the importance of a company structure in the undertaking of local economic development. Further, the time allowed for consultation, and the Government's willingness to understand the importance of the issue, have been less than satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government decided that the first Widdicombe recommendation relating to the view that local authority companies could be set up only where there was specific enabling legislation would prove restrictive, so they did not accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1988 consultation paper, the Government, noted the contribution made by company structures, and stated:
	<span class='label label-info column'>748</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is clear that there are important operational advances for a local authority in a variety of cases in using a company to conduct an activity in which the authority has an involvement."</p></blockquote>
They added that they
	<br><blockquote><p>"do not wish to restrict this flexibility, which has particular use in joint ventures".</p></blockquote>
The Government have not pursued a frontal attack on local authority companies. Instead, they have attempted to restrict and constrain local authority interests in companies through regulations that will restrict substantially the involvement of local authorities in organisations that use a company structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposed requirements go beyond the concerns raised by Widdicombe. The Government intend to pursue the matter throughout local government services and external relationships with the private and voluntary sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicombe recommendation related only to local authority-controlled companies. The proposals in the Bill extend that, and are designed to constrain local authorities' interests in companies per se, chiefly by bringing many such companies within the local authority capital controls system which is set out in part IV.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed restrictions on companies in part V were set out in a consultation document published by the Department of the Environment in June 1988. There was a required response date of 30 July 1988. That document provoked extensive criticism and argument from a wide range of local authorities and their associations, from commercial organisations such as chambers of commerce, and from the voluntary sector. The changes accepted by the Government after consultation are identified in the DoE paper entitled:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local Authorities' Interests in Companies in England Wales; Summary Points Made in Response to Consultation Documents and Government Comments".</p></blockquote>
The changes are relatively minor and the main thrust of the proposals remains. As a result, local government is faced with complex and vague legislation which will adversely affect worthwhile initiatives undertaken by local authority companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wide variety of interests in which local authority companies are involved reflects diverse local circumstances and is a strength of local government. The DoE survey discovered that more than one third of local authority companies are involved in economic development. Of the remainder, nearly one fifth involve information technology centres or training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments for local authorities using companies to provide urban regeneration, economic development and training can be summarised simply. First, these matters have new needs but require different solutions. By using the company approach, local authorities can respond with greater flexibility and speed to meet the needs of their local economies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the company structure enables economic development and other aspects of urban regeneration to take place in close partnership with the private sector. The Government have promoted such partnerships and the maximising of private sector
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0833">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>749</span>
investment in inner-city areas through joint ventures is a constant theme of Government policy. In my constituency, the private sector and the London borough of Haringey got together to convert the former Sainsbury's store in Tottenham High road into retail units for the benefit of small business. The venture was welcomed by the Government and by the people of Tottenham, who were pleased to get rid of an eyesore. The units have been taken by ethnic minority businesses and reflect the people of the area. Haringey and other councils have taken on board the Government's request that local authorities enter into joint ventures with the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, in many areas, public sector intervention is needed to tackle poor infrastructure, high unemployment, inadequate skills and the absence of private sector investment. A major reason for local authorities' use of companies, solely or in joint ventures, is their attempt to raise additional funds to match or to exceed those provided by the public sector. Often, developments could not go ahead without public or local authority funding. In other cases, a public sector contribution has attracted more than four times as much in private funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have been led to believe that the Government want joint ventures because they want private investment rather than public sector investment. The Government say that they want private sector business acumen to be placed at the disposal of local authorities. Local authorities have taken the Government at their word, but yet again they are being restricted in their attempts to carry out the Government's wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall outline some of the Government's proposals—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman and he seems to be going rather wide. His speech is beginning to sound like a clause stand part speech. I hope that he will keep himself in order by referring occasionally to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just about to do that, Mr. Hunt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 372 was tabled to challenge the extent of the Government's commitment to training where local authorities are involved. We want to test the reasons why employment or training companies fall within the scope of the bill. We want the Minister to give those reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate on economic development in part III, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is nothing in the Bill to restrict spending money on training"</p></blockquote>
That was said in the context of a discussion on ITECs, social services training centres and sheltered workshops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later, the Minister said that he wanted to get the regulations right—he was relating this to training and economic development—
	<br><blockquote><p>"in association with the local authorities … The purpose is to ensure that the regulations do not restrict. I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no question of a financial limit."—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 16 March 1989; c.467–470.]</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>750</span>
Part III cannot be considered in isolation from parts IV and V. Part V defines three types of local authority companies—controlled companies, influenced companies and arm's length companies. Part IV brings controlled and influenced companies within the ambit of the new system of local authority capital controls, whereby all expenditure by such companies will count against the control total of the authority involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While it may therefore be appropriate to say in broad terms, as the Government do, that there is nothing in the Bill to restrict spending on training, the details of the application of part V seem to contradict that. Where training needs and central Government constraints on local authority spending clash, we believe that training will suffer. Of course, part V is also peppered with references to regulations and the powers of the Secretary of State. Perhaps the Minister can explain how those powers will be used to facilitate local authority involvement in training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's consultative paper,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local Authorities' Interests in Companies",</p></blockquote>
published in June 1988, set out in table C the purposes of companies as identified by the local authorities which replied to the DoE's questionnaire. One hundred and twenty seven were concerned with economic development. A further 42 were ITECs or training companies. All categories of local authority identified in the survey—the shire districts, shire counties, metropolitan districts and London boroughs—are involved with that type of company. The Minister may say that many of those companies are minority interest companies. Would he be willing to include in the Bill a specific permission for local authorities to hold minority interests in training companies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate on part III, the Minister also stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"trading that reasonably results from training will be available"—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 16 March 1989, c. 469.]—</p></blockquote>
under the economic development power, and that regulations will be drafted to meet the difficulty posed by current restrictions on local trading or training. If local authority companies which provide training were to be excluded from the provisions of this Bill, at least one area of difficulty would be addressed. I should like the Minister to address it in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are particularly concerned that information technology centres, many of which operate as local authority companies, will be adversely affected by the Bill. Some are limited by guarantee and are funded by councils and private sector sponsors, with council representatives as directors holding other positions. Training consortiums, including those previously designated as training agents and managers under the adult training scheme, are threatened. That would affect the administration of ITECs and youth training scheme funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention in the Bill to aggregate interest where several companies are involved may be particularly unfair to training companies, because all authorities may not receive the same immediate benefit, although all may have an equal commitment to furthering the economic development of their region.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0834">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>751</span>
Again, if training companies were not included in the Bill, the problem would not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) has said. I, too, could give examples of good works carried out by local authority companies. The hon. Gentleman quoted, very fairly, the Widdicombe report, and the Government's response to that report before the introduction of our legislation clearly acknowledged the considerable amount of good works that were being carried out by local authority companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Gentleman's experience in local government enables him to give examples of what local authority companies can do, particularly in training. My experience is of what they have done in economic development, sometimes in joint ventures, not only with the private sector, but on occasion with the Department of the Environment in providing sheltered workshop accommodation for small businesses, which were another example that he gave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only difference between us is whether the example which the hon. Member for Tottenham gave, and which is enshrined in amendment No. 373, should allow local authority companies to escape from the restrictions that we are imposing on local authority companies. We take the view that, as local authority companies can be seen to be an extension of their local authorities, they should be subject to the same financial constraints that we impose on local authorities. To put it another way: our basic proposition is that when a company is effectively under the control of a local authority, it is right that the most significant controls that Parliament has laid down for the conduct of local authorities should apply to that company. The company is an extension of the local authority, and should therefore observe the same principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of conjecture, not fact, that the private sector acumen of which the hon. Member for Tottenham spoke is present in all local authority companies. I am quite prepared to acknowledge that the majority of such companies have become more financially responsible—, certainly comparing today's experience with what happened when many of them were formed some time ago. That is a change for the better. My difficulty is that a number of the local authority companies that have been set up by local authorities—Conservative as well as Socialist; I do not attack only local authorities that are controlled by Socialists—give me cause of concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give two examples but, if the hon. Member for Tottenham will forgive me, I would prefer not to give the names, because I could go on for ever. The Government do not systematically receive information about all the shortcomings of local authority companies. We have learnt of cases in which companies sponsored by local authorities have behaved in ways which we do not regard as being in the tradition of the best local government. For example, a London borough sponsored a training
	<span class='label label-info column'>752</span>
company that has gone into liquidation, leaving many unsatisfied debtors. A county council sponsored another training agency which, to put it mildly, has had an unsatisfactory course to liquidation. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will not support that any more than I would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The constraints in the Bill are not a straitjacket in any way. Most of the people whom I have met since the Bill was published, and who are responsible for running local authority companies, have little quarrel with the argument that they should be under the same registration and legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope to persuade the hon. Member for Tottenham to withdraw the amendment or, if he is not prepared to do so, to accept that we have no intention of trying to stop the excellent work of many of the local authority companies, but to make one exception, as amendment No. 372 seeks to do, would be nonsensical. The other examples that I gave might as well be enshrined as exceptions. There will be some flexibility, if the clause is left as drafted, which the hon. Member for Tottenham and I would welcome. Any exception would be a retrograde step.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Minister has stated that the Government have no intention of stopping the good work done by local authority training companies. He said that there would be a degree of flexibility in this case, and we look forward to seeing how flexible the Government will be once the Bill is enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pursue the matter of training. I know that some members of the Government agree with us that training is most important, especially in local authorities where there is a skill shortage in crafts in the building trade, for example, because many employers have stopped offering apprenticeships. Local authorities have to pick up those training requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Training should be a priority. Given the Minister's assurance that there will be some flexibility and that the Government do not intend to stop the work of local authority training companies, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Government amendment No. 497, in page 61, line 16, leave out "and".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 498, 507, 509 and amendment No. 512, in clause 59, page 65, line 22, leave out from beginning to "and" in line 24 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(6) No power to make an order under this section shall be exercisable unless a draft to the order has been laid before and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament;".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain briefly why the Government amendments have been tabled and why we oppose amendment No. 512.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 497, is a paving amendment for amendment No. 498, which has two purposes. First,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0835">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>753</span>
and most important, it will bring companies under the control or influence of passenger transport executives within the scope of part V, and hence of the new capital finance regime as applied to other companies in the local authority sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We debated passenger transport executives under clause 30, and I shall not repeat what I said then. They are now rightly treated as part of the local authority sector and the rules should continue to treat them so. Thus, the position of companies that are an extension of passenger transport executives must be considered in the same light as companies that are an extension of local authorities. Passenger transport executives would have the same potential as local authorities to use companies to avoid controls to which they were subject. Therefore, to ensure that there is a comprehensive and logical pattern for the whole of the local authority sector, it is necessary to bring within the system companies subject to the control or influence of PTEs. That is what the amendment seeks to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second purpose of the amendment is to deal with the consequences of that action, because the legislation for PTEs is on some matters separate from that of local authorities. Thus it will be necessary to make different provision for certain cases which would not be necessary if they were not included. The power to make orders needs to be more flexible. The subordinate legislation will be of greater clarity if the provisions for PTEs are in a separate order, as the amendment provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To save repetition, the amendment also brings together other provisions about orders that appear elsewhere in the Bill. Amendments Nos. 507 and 509 delete provisions that will be superseded by amendment No. 498.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 512 would, once again, attempt to provide that subordinate legislation under the Bill should be subject to the affirmative, not the negative, procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have explained more often than I can remember that there is little real difference between the negative and affirmative procedures. In both cases, Parliament can debate the statutory instrument and express its wishes. The only difference is that, with a negative instrument, the Opposition must say that they want to debate rather than wait for the Government to offer one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have explained before, when the system of reviewing subordinate legislation was last reviewed, the joint committee listed the types of legislation that should, as a matter of course, be subject to the affirmative procedure. The instruments under this part fall into none of the categories laid down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I recommend the Committee to have no more truck with this hoary old chestnut than it did the last few times when it was raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With Government amendments Nos. 497 and 498, we are worried about the drawing into the net of passenger transport authorities and their administrative arm, the passenger transport executives. Several matters apply to local authorities.
	<span class='label label-info column'>754</span>
We want to explore them with the Government and ask the Minister to comment on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, how will capital expenditure, and the grants from the passenger transport authority to the passenger transport executive be treated? At present, capital grants by the PTA to the PTE do not count as prescribed expenditure; only the PTE's direct capital expenditure counts. Will that change? The Government have said only that passenger transport executives would be treated similarly to local authority companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will the requirement on local authorities to use 50 per cent. of receipts from the sale of non-housing assets to redeem debt apply to the sale of PTE assets?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, will the PTE have to pay to the PTA the cash remaining from a notional capital receipts unapplied account?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are worried. When the consultation paper, "Local Authorities Interests in Companies" was circulated, it appeared that public airport and public transport companies would be. caught by the provision. This is despite the fact that the Secretary of State for Transport had directed local authorities to establish them. Assurances were given at official level that there was no intention, as a result of the proposals in the consultation paper, to change the main lines of the existing arrangements. Local authorities, especially PTAs and the PTEs, are worried about the change in respect of capital receipts. Will the Minister comment on that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may now speak to our amendment No. 512. We have continually argued with the Government about regulations and, statutory instruments. The regulations that can be made under clause 59 would enable the Secretary of State to take extraordinarily wide powers to intervene in the operations of private companies, and in the autonomy of their actions when they are subject to the influence of a local authority and when there is a minority interest. The regulations could remove the authority's right to take a minority interest. The effects will be dramatic. Many companies will have to hold specific general meetings and amend articles of association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many voluntary organisations will be affected and their autonomy could be severely compromised by the regulations. In addition to reconstituting themselves, voluntary organisations may have to make new applications for charitable status, renegotiate the basis of any local authority funding or even lose funding altogether as councils may decide to pull out of funding because they cannot be involved in the way they would wish with particular organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments has recommended that regulations should be subject to the affirmative procedure where they substantially affect provisions of Acts of Parliament by, for example, changing powers to increase or impose taxation or other financial burdens—that is precisely what the Bill seeks to do—or where regulations
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0836">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>755</span>
involve considerations of special importance. No one will say that is not the purpose in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 59, the regulations will substantially change the nature of part V, which simply sets out the framework of definitions on which the Secretary of State may, in effect, hang a range of powers which he may fix through statutory instrument. Those powers will not be defined by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations will affect taxation for voluntary organisations which are now charities and in receipt of fiscal benefits. Their relations with local authority funders are changed by the regulations to the point at which they have to reconstitute themselves and make new applications for charitable status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations involve considerations of special importance because they interfere in private companies in which public sector bodies take a less than controlling interest. Therefore, they will affect the rights and powers of many private citizens and, in particular, many voluntary organisations.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) will press amendment No. 512 to a vote because I have already dealt with the matter to which he referred. It is clear that this is not a difference of opinion between us but a yawning chasm between the two sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I shall answer in detail the hon. Gentleman's questions. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the new system of financial control moves from control of expenditure to control of borrowing for capital purposes. Borrowing by PTEs and their companies will be seen in this context as an extension of the PTEs and will be controlled in exactly the same way as those in the local authority sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked how capital receipts will be treated. It will be done in exactly the same way as for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only point that remains for me to deal with is the hon. Gentleman's question about how public transport and public airport companies will be treated. The Department of Transport has made it clear that the main rules established by the Transport Act 1985 and the Airports Act 1986 for public transport and airport companies will not be changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee, but I want to raise one or two issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part V refers to controlled companies. Such companies could be completely controlled by the local authority in terms of the majority of votes at the general meeting, or controlled by the company directors. I refer to companies controlled by local authorities. The Bill provides that a local authority-controlled company must not engage in activities outside the local authority's powers. The capital transactions of the company will count as transactions of the local authority. Borrowing by the company must be sanctioned by the local authority and its accounts will be part of the local authority's accounts. The appointment of auditors will require the approval of the Audit Commission, and the local authority's own auditors must be given access to the company's accounts and records.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authority's terms of reference on procedure and conduct will apply too. Those disqualified from membership of the local authority will similarly be disqualified from participation in the running of the company. Those who are employed by the company will be disqualified from membership of the local authority. Legislation that has recently been made on local government will apply to local authority-controlled companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, contracts that are awarded must meet the requirements on a non-commercial consideration. Access to information requirements will hold, as will requirements on compulsory competitive tendering legislation. The activities of the company will be brought within the scope of the local government ombudsman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Yorkshire Mining Museum Trust Ltd is under local authority control. It was formed in 1983 with the support of all south and west Yorkshire local authorities. The company members are British Coal and Wakefield and Kirklees metropolitan council. The structure reflects the significant financial contribution towards the scheme made by the local authorities. The company's aim was to establish a major regional museum to serve northern England and Scotland and that wish has been implemented successfully. The museum now employs 55 members of staff and is confidently expected to welcome about 100,000 visitors this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In November last year, the museum won the British Guild of Travel Writers' annual award for the best new venture and, despite its not being located within an EEC designated assisted area, the European Commission agreed last September to award it a grant of just over £500,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regrettably, part V will have serious implications for the museum, especially in its commercial viability. Because of the composition of the board of trustees, the trust appears to fall into the category of a company that is under the control of a local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0837">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>757</span>
referring to the area in which I am especially interested, and I should like to add to his lucid remarks. The museum has existed only for a short time and is still developing for the benefit of a wider community. I hope that my hon. Friend will emphasise that there is still much work to be done and that any restriction imposed by this legislation would be against the best interests of the west Yorkshire community. It is important that this enterprise be allowed to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) makes the point that this fledgling company, which has won awards and attracted finance—not from the Government, but from wider afield—can be caught under part V of the Bill and that that could be detrimental to the company. I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who takes a great interest in these matters. We want the Minister to say how the flexibility to which he referred previously would apply in the case of this museum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Yorkshire mining museum was certainly not established as a device to avoid any governmental directives. The company was formed with charitable status in order to attract private sector interest, especially in the area of sponsorship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine Patnick 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a member of South Yorkshire county council when it funded the mining museum trust, with Wakefield and other councils such as West Yorkshire. That was not their intention. It was a matter of funding. The councils' idea was to create a museum over which they would retain control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that information. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) is supporting my point. I trust that he will remember it when he votes on the issue. I shall explain the implications of part V for that museum, and I am sure that he will agree that something should be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government's proposals are enacted, the trust would fall within the controls of the Local Government Goods and Services Act, which would exclude some of the activities currently undertaken solely in order to raise revenue for the museum—for example, consultancy services provided at the request of other independent bodies. In addition, the trust would be obliged to operate within the regime of central governmental control of local authority activities, especially compulsory competitive tendering and financial control. This would be an unwelcome burden on the museum's administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The capital transactions of the trust, including any sponsorship monies raised, would count against the capital allocation of the two local authorities involved—Wakefield and Kirklees. Obviously, these authorities may have to give priority to their own schemes, rather than to the museum, at a time when resources are constrained. There would also be problems in determining against which council's allocation any capital transaction would count.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The site would have to be purchased or leased by the trust from the council at market value, despite
	<span class='label label-info column'>758</span>
the fact that it was conveyed by British Coal to the council on a peppercorn basis to be held for the purpose of the museum, which is the trust of the council. That relationship would have to change if the clause remains part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This example reveals the problems that this part of the Bill will create for local authorities. Other examples to which my hon. Friends will refer include arm's length companies and influenced companies, but I wish to describe how voluntary organisations will be affected. Many voluntary organisations are constituted as companies limited by guarantee. For example, most citizens advice bureaux, many community enterprise projects, social welfare projects, councils for voluntary service and others are companies. That has often been encouraged by the Government. The Department of Trade and Industry, for example, encouraged citizens advice bureaux to become companies to limit the liability of their management committees against potential claims from clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, if those organisations receive grants from local authorities—as most of them do—they usually have one or two local authority representatives on their management committees. That has always been considered a good way of ensuring public accountability for the funding and a way in which to develop a partnership between the organisations and the local authorities concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals in clause 56 have major implications for those arrangements. They will subject voluntary organisations to new controls, and will require extremely complex administrative arrangements to determine the categories of controls to which the organisations will be subjected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Council for Voluntary Organisations has expressed anxiety about those implications since the Department of the Environment issued its consultation paper last June. It has met Department of the Environment officials, and it is even more worried about the effect of the proposals now that the Bill has been published. It fears that, as so often happens, in trying to hit one target, the Government have, perhaps unintentionally, hit at another one. The council considers that the simplest course of action would be to exempt voluntary organisations from the controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several local authority associations are worried about the Bill. The London Boroughs Association and the Association of District Councils were unanimous in reminding the DoE that local authority companies did not exist in a vacuum, but were subject to company law, through which necessary changes might be more appropriately considered. That would have the effect of catching private sector abuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander. We are surprised that the changes have been enacted not under company law but under the Bill. The Government have shown once again how prejudiced they are against local authorities, by not allowing local authority companies to operate in the same way as private companies. If the Government believe in competition and in a free-for-all, surely
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0838">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>759</span>
it is incumbent on them to allow local authority companies the same freedom of manoeuvre as private companies. Will the Minister explain the Government's double standards on that issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to refer to the Yorkshire mining museum because—if members of the Committee will excuse the allegory—it was a cross that I bore for a long time. In the days before the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament got a grip on south Yorkshire and when the Ministry of Defence wished to twin us with a Royal Navy vessel, South Yorkshire county council decided that, as mining was the mainstay of south Yorkshire, a submarine would be an ideal vehicle to use. One can only see a submarine when it is on the surface, and we did not think that south Yorkshire should be buried below the sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The museum was funded by ratepayers' cash—I cannot remember whether the amount we lobbed in was £300,000 or £400,000. West Yorkshire county council gave a similar amount, and Kirklees and Wakefield areas contributed too. The money was used to buy Capwell colliery which, to all intents and purposes, was a dead colliery. It was an eyesore, and something had to be done about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 2 March I received a letter from the Yorkshire mining museum drawing to my attention the point raised by the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant). It was argued in the letter that it was inappropriate for the company that runs the museum to come under the proposed controls of local authority interests. The secretary of the organisation concluded that the company would fall to be treated as a company controlled by the local authority. The chairman is councillor Norman Hartshorne—I do not know which authority he is from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The company believes that, if it borrows, it should be exempted from the controls that Parliament has placed on local authorities. However, the company is as much a part of the public sector as the local authorities that control it, and clearly should be controlled in the same way. If the local authorities do not want the company to be subjected to those controls, they should keep it at arm's length and put it into the voluntary sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us whether he thinks that a charitable trust should be exempt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make my speech in my way. I have listened to the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) rant on for many a long hour and then withdraw his amendment, so for once he can have the pleasure of my voice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The secretary says in his letter that any sponsorship money raised would count against the capital allocation of the local authority involved. That is not correct. The proposals for local authority interests in companies must be examined against the background of the Government's concurrent proposals on local authority capital controls. The Government propose to change capital controls on local authorities from control based on expenditure to control based on borrowing. If a third party gave a grant to a local
	<span class='label label-info column'>760</span>
authority-controlled company for capital expenditure, that would not affect the ability of the local authority to borrow for its own purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The secretary also alleges that the museum site would have to be purchased or leased from the council at a market price. That is not correct. The Government do not propose to impose constraints on the ability of a local authority to give concessionary terms to a company that it controls. The only relevant proposal is that, if such concessions are given, the company will not be able to be treated at arm's length from the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien), I am referring to the letter dated 2 March 1989 from the Yorkshire mining museum which, I assume, was received by all hon. Members representing Yorkshire constituencies. The secretary alleges that the trust could not have its borrowing guaranteed by the council. That is incorrect. The Government propose no limits on the powers of local authorities to guarantee borrowing by companies that they control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tottenham created a black hole—I could hardly call it a red herring. Without the benefit of the miner's lamp of the hon Member for Normanton, the hon. Gentleman led us down the hole. The example that he used was based, as usual, on lack of knowledge of the area. If the Yorkshire mining museum moves into the voluntary sector, away from local government control, it should have no fear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) should not have the excuse of not knowing the position in his area. The question, which my hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham identified and which has emerged from the debate today, is whether a charitable trust is exempt. When the hon. Gentleman could not answer my intervention, he revealed that he did not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is uncertainty. No one is saying that charitable trusts are definitely exempt or not exempt, but the mining museum and other bodies are uncertain about their status. Those who have examined the Bill, including the mining museum group, are all uncertain about the exemption. Will the Government clarify the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that specific point, the definition is exactly the same. Even as a charitable trust that is controlled in the way that we have defined in the clause, it will be incorporated in the provisions mainly or specifically designed to constrain companies in exactly the same way as local authorities. Does the hon. Gentleman see what I mean? If financial interests are involved or councillors are on the body, all the other definitions that we have talked about will apply, charitable trust or no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard the Minister's attempt at an explanation. He asked me, "Do you see what I mean?". I only hope that the courts will see what he means because, ultimately, they will have to interpret the Bill when it becomes an Act. It will not be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0839">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>761</span>
interpreted by us and I assume that the Minister will not visit a court in Yorkshire and say to a judge, "What I actually meant was this"—when there is an argument about whether a charitable trust is exempt. The matter is not as clear as he would like to think and the bodies that are concerned fear that they are not exempt as he sought to show, so he should re-examine the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased when my hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) referred to my old and trusted supporters, the Conservative-controlled London Boroughs Association and Association of District Councils. As my hon. Friend said, those bodies told the Department that they are subject to company law and so come under the constraints. I point out to the Minister that company law is being changed in another place at present. We do not know what changes the House of Lords will propose, so I should like him to tell us about his longer-term thinking in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Government hold those two organisations in contempt and do not give their views much value but I have given them considerable credence as they have been very useful to me. I make no bones about that. On several occasions they have pointed out to me, and to other hon. Members on both sides of the House, that the Government's policies towards local government are causing mayhem. We have used their quotes unreservedly and although the Government have not listened to them they should do so in this instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday, the Secretary of State for Wales made an interesting speech about companies, regional government and the success of the Japanese and European economies, pointing out that they depended on the link between Government and the private sector and also with regional government. It will not have escaped the Committee's notice that the Minister who is to reply to the debate is a younger man than the Secretary of State for Wales who, in turn, is younger than the Prime Minister. I cannot be the only person to think after hearing that speech that the Secretary of State for Wales was making a bid for the leadership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall redirect my comments more specifically, Mr. Hunt, although it is a serious point because the Secretary of State for Wales said that the regions of Britain could not be regenerated without regional government and a close link between the Government and private companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with those comments and readily acknowledge that the Secretary of State has sought
	<span class='label label-info column'>762</span>
to establish such a link in Wales. We are troubled by the clause because it undermines the ability of local authorities and the private sector to link up in the way that the Secretary of State for Wales and many other people in this country would like. Overseas, that link has been established for years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I shall not make a lengthy reply to the debate, it may be better if I deal with the intervention.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fundamental flaw in what the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) said. My right hon. Friend did not advocate regional government. It was widely reported this morning that he was talking about an effective regional policy, which is somewhat different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to accept that. It is a minor point and as you, Mr. Hunt, would say, it would be out of order for me to go too far on the subject of regional government. The Secretary of State for Wales was clear about the need to enable private companies and local authorities to work together, which is right. Although the Bill is not a full frontal attack, it is creating acute uncertainty—as we saw in the case of the mining museum. The development of the link will be inhibited. Does the Minister see himself being led in a future Government by the present Secretary of State for Wales—who he thinks has a long-term future—or does he see himself clinging to the skirts of the present Prime Minister in the hope that she will go on for longer than the Secretary of State for Wales? Will the Minister tell the Committee his views on the involvement of private companies and the public sector, referred to by the Secretary of State for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was dying for you, Mr. Hunt, to intervene and to repeat an interjection, that many hon. Members will recall from several weeks ago. You said then that you were not particularly interested in the future career of the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley). I hope you are not interested in my future career either. I can tell the hon. Member for Hammersmith that a decision about my future career is, as the Americans would say, above my pay grade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to respond to the specific points raised by the hon. Gentleman. He asked me about the Companies Bill. I shall be delighted to elaborate on that, but with your permission, Mr. Hunt, that might be more appropriate under clause 57. I shall have one more shot at trying to explain to the hon. Gentleman whether a charitable trust would fall foul of the legislation. If a trust is formed as a company, the definitions enshrined in clause 56 would come into effect. If not, they would not. I accept that the courts may have to deliberate on individual cases. I hope that they will not, but we in the Department of the Environment are well prepared to give advice on individual circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) is anxious to hear further details about the Yorkshire Mining Museum Trust. I give the same reply that I gave earlier. I was trying to put the answer differently because I have already responded to two of the hon. Gentleman's amendments. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) rushed to my assistance, putting it differently, which I welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no criticism of what the trust is doing, or of its attempts to attract tourists and to explain to them the heritage of that part of the country. But the Bill provides that where a local authority has control, the company should abide by the rules of the local authority. That is just what my hon. Friend the Member for Hallam said; I cannot put it in any other way. The examples of compulsory competition and limits on trade that my hon. Friend cited are just what this part of the Bill is aimed at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already dealt with the question of capital funding; on which there is another misunderstanding. As I said, we are dealing with the new capital controls on borrowing. The provision will have implications only where the company borrows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tottenham then spoke of citizens advice bureaux. I yield to no one in my praise of those. We have informed the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux that its members have little cause for concern. The association acknowledged that in the paper circulated to members of the Committee. Page 2 of the submission says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Civil servants at the Department of the Environment have sought to assure us that the CABX will fall into the category of minority interest.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Their"—</p></blockquote>
the Department of the Environment's—
	<br><blockquote><p>"argument is that if we come into the category of Companies in which Local Authorities have a minority interest we can be exempted by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>764</span>
I underline that fact once again: it must be properly understood that the proposals will not in any way hamper citizens advice bureaux.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rest of NACAB's briefing paper contains some misunderstandings. We think that most, if not all, CABs will be authorised minority interests and, on that basis, the Bill contains no real implications for them. If there are any other cases, we shall consider their problems in order to implement our aim that CABs should not be hampered. I am sure that there is joint support in the House as a whole for the CABs. If I thought that they would fall foul of the Bill, I should be most distressed and I should take action to ensure that they did not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to inhibit my hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) but I have one brief point to raise. I looked at the clause as the Minister was speaking. Clause 56(1) lists the bodies referred to in part V of the Bill, and includes in paragraph (e)
	<br><blockquote><p>"a society registered or deemed to be registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965 or under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act (Northern Ireland) 1969."</p></blockquote>
That suggests that such a body is included. That does not fit in with what the Minister was saying to me when he suggested that it may or may not be included, depending on the circumstances. He may be right that it depends on other circumstances and definitions and so on but, the provision will clearly produce an awful mess in a court of law. Will he look again at the wording and at his answer? I suspect that CABs are included and that that is what the court would decide. I am not a lawyer and I do not know with what other clause a court would compare clause 56(1)(e).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to look again at clause 56(1)(e).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in clause 56(1)(a), (b), (c) and (d) answer the question to which I tried to reply earlier and make it clear how the courts will eventually interpret whether a trust that is constituted as a company will fall foul of the Bill. That cannot be made clearer, although I repeat my undertaking to reconsider paragraph (e).

	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about the Minister's reply concerning the Yorkshire mining museum because he and those who drew up the Bill have not considered the full facts. When the proposal was made in 1982 and the board of trustees was established in 1983, West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire county councils were the prime supporters of the scheme. Funding and administration were undertaken largely by those two councils, but legislation has since abolished those county councils and the funding of the museum and its future have changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Credit must be given to the local people for the inception of that small working mine on the borders
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0841">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>765</span>
of Kirklees and Wakefield because, when the National Coal Board decided to close the mine, they decided to open a museum in the area where the Yorkshire mining industry was born—west Yorkshire. It was decided that the establishment of a real mine as a museum would be a focal point for that part of the country and especially that part of Yorkshire. The museum is well supported, but due to the changed circumstances brought about by the Government, the trust formed itself into a company because it had to raise funds and required protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The company was formed so that the mining museum can continue to operate and its intention is to be self-sufficient. In the meantime, the museum requires the protection that it has requested in letters to members of the Committee and to Members of Parliament who represent constituencies in the Yorkshire area. A letter was also sent to Mr. Hastings of the regional office of the Department of the Environment on 14 March. Has the Minister seen that letter? It states in detail the anxiety of the museum's director, the trustees and the company's directors. The trust is an independent charitable trust with limited company status. In replying to my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) the Minister said that if it is a company with councillors on the board, it will be covered by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the museum was established there were tremendous changes. I ask the Minister to consult the regional office of the DoE on the letter from the trustees which gives details about the issues and asks for consideration of them. The trustees can see the pitfalls that lie ahead if the Bill continues in its present form and applies to them in the way that they are suspicious it will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to look at the letter that has been sent to the regional office of the DoE before any decision is taken on the matter, to take account of all the important points made in it and to give further consideration to this part of the Bill and the position of the Yorkshire mining museum. Perhaps we could have a report on the matter from the Minister on Report, because if we do not ask for protection and present the case for this and similar organisations now, I am sure that when the Bill is passed they will find that they are on the wrong side of the law. Once a decision is taken in the House, it will be difficult to secure an alternative that will protect organisations, such as the Yorkshire mining museum. Conservative Members should not press their views until the Minister has fully considered this important matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that the Minister speaks with forked tongue. I hope that that is parliamentary language. He talks about "excellent" local authorities and "admiring" the work of local authority training agencies and so on, yet he seeks to tie up local authorities in constraints that do not apply to the private sector. I asked him why double standards existed for local authorities and private companies, but he has not yet answered. I hope that he will do so now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The contribution from the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) was put fairly, and I respect the spirit in which he spoke. Unfortunately, I am less enthusiastic about the contribution of his hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant). I know that sometimes it is difficult for us to get messages across, and sometimes I have to tell certain hon. Members certain things 13 times before they are on to it in a flash, but I refuse to repeat what I have already said on three occasions, and I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the report of it in 
	<i>Hansard.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must convince the hon. Member for Normanton that what is being proposed here is nothing more than bringing the trust, if it does in fact fall foul of the clause, within the financial controls of local authorities, of which it is an extension. If it is not an extension of municipalisation, there is no cause for concern. I respect the fact that a great deal of hard work has been put into setting up this museum trust. I hope that it is hugely successful. It sounds as though it is. It already employs 55 people and is attracting a considerable number of visitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter to the responsible regional controller in my Department, to which the hon. Member for Tottenham refers, is probably the same letter sent to Members of Parliament. If I am wrong, I readily apologise, but its message is the same as that conveyed to my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick). My right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government came straight to the point in the third paragraph of his reply to that letter where he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do not know the detailed constitution of the Yorkshire Mining Museum Trust Ltd, but from the fact that the secretary concludes that the company would, under our proposals, fail to be treated as a company controlled by a local authority, it would appear that either a majority of the members of the company general meeting or of the board of directors are appointed by, or at the behest of, the local authorities involved."</p></blockquote>
My right hon. Friend makes it clear that his reply is surmision. If it proves to be fact and not hypothesis the trust would fall foul of the Bill, but there is no intention of preventing the trust from operating on its present basis. It is doing a fine job. If the trust wishes legally to avoid the constraints imposed by the clause, it would not be beyond the wit of man to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I take it that the only question at issue is the extent of the trust's municipalisation? Is that the only factor that would cause the trust to fall foul of the legislation? I do not know who would identify the degree of municipalisation. Perhaps it would be Department of Environment officers. Is the Minister saying that it would be wrong for municipalisation to be extended?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to upset the hon. Gentleman. I do not like doing so at the best of times. I am here to help him. We have not taken the time and trouble to write into the Bill the various qualifications that define a local authority company only to fall foul of legislation that imposes tighter financial controls. All I am saying is that we must be careful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0842">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>767</span>
The words
	<br><blockquote><p>"simply an extension of municipalisation"</p></blockquote>
are mine. Several times this morning I have used the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"simply an extension of the local authority".</p></blockquote>
They are alternative terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that because of lack of interest it may be difficult, although not impossible, to attract private-sector sponsorship in the early stages. I have experienced such problems in my constituency. I respect the fact that the trust may have been put together to attract finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only comparison that I can make is with the local enterprise agency, with which the hon. Member for Normanton is also familiar. The support that a local authority gives a local enterprise agency may give the agency the necessary imprimatur to attract private-sector sponsorship. However, to comply with Finance Act legislation, a local enterprise agency must have private-sector control, with private-sector board members outnumbering those from the public sector. I recognise that a local enterprise agency is not a local authority company. I am drawing the comparison because both the trust and such an agency attract money from sponsorship at the outset, which the hon. Members for Normanton and for Tottenham were discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a local authority company expressed such disquiet about this part of the Bill, I should be worried that something was going on. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am trying to be fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our officials at the Department of the Environment are ready, willing and waiting to give advice on the structure of the trust. At present I do not know what it is. That is nobody's fault. Perhaps the hon. Member for Normanton will ask the secretary of the trust to outline it in a letter to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, or to me, and we shall do whatever we can to help. We are also prepared to meet representatives of the trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot let the Minister's comments go by without setting the record straight. There is nothing shady or underhand in the running of this organisation. The Minister said that because of the disquiet expressed there might be something to be afraid of. He was supported by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick), which is to be expected. At no time has anything taken place that was not in the best interests of those whom the trustees serve. There is nothing shady. The books are available for anyone to examine. Meetings are held in public, which is different from many organisations that the Minister has set up. They are in a public arena and the trust would not have got off the ground without the initiative of local authorities. There is nothing suspicious in the operation of the company. We hope that the Minister will consider the matter in depth because if there are difficulties that he or his officers have not identified but which have been noted by the people who carry out the work, he ought to deal with them. I hope that he will do that before deciding about the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 392, in page 61, line 20, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless the Secretary of State otherwise directs".</p></blockquote>
I shall be brief. The amendment is a probing measure, as the Minister realises. We want to ask several questions which, I realise, he may be unable to respond to now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, we are worried about exemptions. Does the Minister have in mind any exemptions? If so, do they relate to individual companies or to categories of companies? We are not sure whether he has a personal vendetta against one or two companies or whether he is waging outright war against various groups. We should like to know which it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also like to know whether any exceptions have been discussed with outside interests. Have there already been discussions on the matter? Will the Minister commit himself to consultation with the local authorities and local authority associations before any directions are made? That is important, because they should know what is happening. What parliamentary scrutiny will be available to Members of Parliament who want to know what the Government are doing? Will there be opportunities for debate? Will there be reports in the House of Commons Library? In what way will the matter be brought to the attention of the House?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing only with such exempted powers in part V. The Secretary of State similarly has a power to make an exemption by direction under clause
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0843">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>769</span>
57(7) and clause 58(1). We are anxious lest there be any uncertainty about the Bill's effect in that respect, because there seems to be an overlap and we do not know whether it is merely an indication of uncertainty. The Minister may wish to write to me on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister write applications for exemption, either by companies or local authorities? Will he agree to exempt automatically all cases in which the control is agreed by both the local authority and the company to be accidental or of no concern to either side? Will he guarantee that all directions will be issued on the basis of common criteria, at least within categories of companies, and will he consult on the suggested classification of types of companies for those purposes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I unashamedly put my argument in the form of questions because they are the questions that have been put to me by a wide range of organisations that are concerned about the lack of clarity. As I have already said, if the Minister cannot respond to all of them in Committee I am happy to pass them on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may have seen the submission of the Library Association, which is concerned about two of its companies. Although public library services are run separately by each library authority, the authorities in England and Wales form themselves into regional library systems, and two of the regional groupings are companies, so will come under part V. The two are the London and south-east regional library system and the north-west regional library system, and they fear that they may be caught unless they are exempted. They and I will welcome clarification of an issue which, as we have made clear in this fairly long debate, is likely to constrain and inhibit what most of us regard as good and welcome developments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond as fully as I can to the questions from the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley). If I miss any, I shall be glad to write to the hon. Gentleman, if that will give him comfort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether there had been any discussions with local authority companies. Quite a number of local authority companies have discussed their status with us. The hon. Gentleman asked whether there would be consultations with local authority associations, and the answer is that we shall consult them on the subject of general exemptions. Individual cases not covering a category are a matter for discussion with the companies concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hammersmith asked what opportunity there would be for parliamentary scrutiny. He is as aware as I am of the various mechanisms that are available, so I shall not catalogue them for him. There are, for example, opportunities for debate in either Government or Opposition time, in Select Committees, on Adjournment debates, through questions, and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of that. The Minister does not need to tell me. I am anxious that even if the information comes from the Minister in time it
	<span class='label label-info column'>770</span>
will not necessarily be picked up in the House. Does the Minister intend to place information in the Library or to issue a Department of the Environment press notice when he takes action? There must be some way in which the Department of the Environment will warn the House that action is being taken under this part of the Bill. To place a report in the Library annually or when action is taken, or to issue a press release are options open to the Minister. If I want to use an Adjournment debate, I know how to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am impressed that the hon. Gentleman knows how to proceed. Great minds think alike. I believe that the best way, apart from a record being kept in the Department of the Environment, is to place a report in the Library.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hammersmith talked about how the various categories should be treated. He asked whether there should be individual or national categories, and I shall give him a good example. He will be familiar with the Goundwork Trust and I am sure that he supports it, as I do. The local companies through which the Groundwork Trust operates, having been formed before the classification of local authority companies was devised, would fall into at least three categories. All of them are heavily dependent on DoE grant for their work. We therefore intend to exempt those companies since we can be certain that they will not take advantage of the potential for avoiding controls, and the complications of having several types of company would be unnecessary. Other cases may arise in which a similar exemption is sensible and we need the power to grant that exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen have argued that if exclusions from control are appropriate, they should be laid down in the Act or in a statutory instrument. We believe that a more flexible approach is needed as a single company only may be involved and the full rigmarole of a statutory instrument would be unnecessary administrative expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already raised the issue, but I want to press my point further. The amendment relates to the fact that the companies legislation is before the House of Lords and the two matters overlap. I am far from sure that the Government have thought through the consequences. I am not as convinced as the Minister that liaison between the Department of the Environment and the Department of Trade and Industry will be adequate. The Government are creating a third set of circumstances in the Bill—different from those that exist and from those proposed in legislation currently before the House of Lords. I cannot help but feel that out of that will come an unholy mess. I suggest to the Minister that there is much hard thinking to be done. Perhaps the Lords will want to examine this part of the Bill when it comes before them, given what they will have already debated. There is much anxiety that the two areas do not link up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave the hon. Member for Hammersmith an undertaking that I should refer to the connnection between the proposals in this part of the Bill and the Companies Bill currently being considered in another place. The companies legislation will introduce a new definition of a subsidiary. It is not a radical new departure on the subject, but rewrites the definition in ways more suited to the present, avoiding some of the problems of the existing version.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new definition has three limbs. A company is a subsidiary of another corporate body when that corporate body either holds a majority of voting rights in that company, or is a member of the company and has the right to appoint or remove a majority of its board of directors, or is a member of it and controls alone, pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders or members, a majority of voting rights in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between that definition and the current version is partly the concentration on voting rights rather than on equity share capital and partly that it speaks as having the right to appoint and
	<span class='label label-info column'>772</span>
remove directors rather than to control the composition of the board of directors. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the next set of amendments deal with that specific matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to add to what I said by giving the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he sought about his amendments, which he was kind enough to say were probing amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I touched on the basic principles behind our proposals for controlled companies when we discussed earlier amendments. As I said, there can be no valid argument against the principle that when a company is controlled by a local authority it acts as an extension of that authority's activities and its business should therefore be subject to the same rules of propriety and financial regulation as the parent authority. That is also a new way of expressing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 348, in page 61, line 31, leave out from "time" to end of line 32 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the power to appoint or remove 3/4 of the holders of directorships without the consent of any person; or".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to challenge the vague wording that the local authority has power to
	<br><blockquote><p>"control the composition of the board."</p></blockquote>
How will the Government establish that a local authority has such powers? One criterion in defining a local authority controlled company, is whether the local authority has
	<br><blockquote><p>"power to control the composition of the board of directors of the company".</p></blockquote>
Control of the composition could entail a limited involvement in the company itself. Several local authorities, especially Labour ones and those in London, have used rights of appointment to ensure that the ethnic minority element of the business community is effectively represented. That could be a local authority controlling the board's composition. Perhaps that is what the Government are trying to get at; I suppose that it hinges on the question of control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the Government attempting to remove any form of local authority involvement? That is what many Conservative Members would like and this may be a first step towards that idyllic state. Are the Government attempting to prevent local authorities from exercising what the Government consider to be overt political control? All these are matters of such subjectivity that they make bad legislation, but that is an old story which is told whenever the Government interfere in local authority affairs. Their interference is not based on efficiency or the requirements of the local population, but on the Government's ideological drive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government propose to interpret the clause more widely, it would be helpful if the Minister gave a definition, notwithstanding the difficulties he has this morning, and I promise to listen intently. If the Minister is in real difficulty, I am prepared to lip read.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0845">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>773</span>
The amendment proposed a clear-cut percentage and emphasises that a local authority could effect a change in a substantial number of directorships without further reference. Therefore, I want a definition from the Government and to know what they propose as an alternative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) referred to the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"control the composition of the board"</p></blockquote>
but it will be removed from the Bill by Government amendment No. 499. That phrase has been understood for many years because it was put in the Companies Act 1948 as part of the definition of a subsidiary. I have explained to the Committee that that Act is being amended by consideration of another Bill in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 348 would raise the proportion of votes that a local authority had to control, before a company became controlled, from a simple majority to 75 per cent. The hon. Gentleman has asked us to move away from the normally accepted definition of what constitutes control over a company to a different one. I am suggesting that Committee Members should examine what is provided in normal company law because it makes nonsense of the proposal. A normal definition of a subsidiary, where a body corporate controls a simple majority, is used for many aspects of regulating the relationship of companies, group accounts, taxations, investigations by inspectors, dealings by directors and so on. The reason for a simple majority, is that a majority is a majority, even if it is only by one vote. The unofficial instant Whip on the Committee will be in a strong position to understand that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment seeks to clarify the criterion that the Secretary of State will apply in determining whether a director of an "arm's length company" was removed with a view to influencing its management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 57(6), an "arm's length company", despite local authority involvement, will not be subject to the full range of restrictions imposed on a local authority company. Subsection (7) allows the criterion regarding no director being removed by resolution under section 303 of the Companies Act 1985 to be varied by the Secretary of State. However, section 303 does not refer to the reasons why a director might be removed. It just relates to the procedure for removal and the replacement of one person by another. Therefore, the general purpose of clause 57(6) is to ensure that a company's business is not subject to significant political influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a director has been removed for political reasons, the Secretary of State will presumably wish to bring the company within the control category. However, the wording of clause 57(7) is so broad that valid commercial consideration for removing a director may similarly be caught. In relation to the management and operation of the companies, local authorities wish to know what considerations the Secretary of State will apply in using his powers under the clause. The amendment is relatively mild and, if accepted, it would give some guidance to local authorities on the operation of companies legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, we are discussing what the Government regard as political and what local authorities regard as political. When the Conservative party has so infiltrated an organisation to ensure that there is no opposition, it is good at ringfencing it and declaring it non-political. There is an entire range of such institutions throughout the country. For example, the City is laughingly referred to as "non-political". It is so Conservative that no one else can get a look in. That being so, it is safe for the Conservative party to
	<span class='label label-info column'>776</span>
declare that it is non-political. What the Tories mean by "non-political" is, "We don't want your politics anywhere near it"—[
	<i>Interruption</i>] I hope that the roars of approval of Conservative Members are recorded in the 
	<i>Official Report</i> to show that they agree with all that I am saying. When the Tories say that institutions are non-political, that simply means that they control them completely. The clause pursues the Government's highly subjective approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am about to say will be boring compared with the contributions that we have just heard. The Government recognise that many companies, although under the control of a local authority, are genuinely run at arm's length from the local authority, which does not interfere with their day-to-day running. Where such a relationship exists, the companies are effectively subject to many of the disciplines that apply to companies operating in the private sector. Therefore, there is less need for some of the statutory rules to which local authorities are subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 57(6) defines what is meant by a company being operated "at arm's length". We must consider whether a local authority is interfering in a company's management by removing directors. Subsection (6)(a) requires that directors of an arm's length company are
	<br><blockquote><p>"appointed for a fixed term of at least two years".</p></blockquote>
But there will be times—I hope that they will be rare—when it will be necessary to remove a director because of misconduct. Subsection (7) gives the Secretary of State power to direct that such a removal will not affect the arm's length status of a company but he cannot
	<br><blockquote><p>"give such a direction if it appears to him that the director was removed with a view to influencing the management of the company."</p></blockquote>

could be regarded as acting with a view to influencing the management of the company. We certainly do not regard removal for genuine incompetence as unreasonable or as disqualifying a company from arm's length status. It is debatable whether such a removal would truly be for the purpose of influencing the management of a company, but we shall study the amendment to see whether clarification of the sort that has been suggested might improve it.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by sympathising with the Minister who has gone to try to sort out his throat but I have no doubt that the Prime Minister will feel that the Secretary of State for Wales should be suffering from the same ailment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) referred to the relationship between the private and public sectors when talking about the Secretary of State for Wales. That is important in relation to clause 58 which deals with what the Bill terms "influenced companies". The purpose of the amendment is to seek to increase the percentage of voting rights held by persons associated with a local authority in a company deemed to be influenced by that authority to 49 per cent., which is more appropriate than the 20 per cent. specified in the Bill.
	<span class='label label-info column'>778</span>
A 20 per cent. holding in a company would be a minority stake that was too low to enable a local authority's representatives to influence company policy, even if there were a business relationship between the company and the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scope of the clause is especially wide as those holding 20 per cent. voting rights as directors or shareholders—this is where the Bill borders on nonsense—can include not only those councillors and officers directly appointed to look after an authority's interests, but others only loosely related or wholly unrelated to that authority. They can include not only officers, such as a borough treasurer or a part-time school secretary as a director, manager, secretary or similar officer of a local authority influenced company, but their spouse, a business associate, a member of a local authority, a person holding office in a political association or other body which a council or local authority include in a description in a nomination paper and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If ever there was a recipe for an increase in bureaucracy, surely, it is the clause. It gives the Government extremely wide powers over local authorities. For a Government who pride themselves on trying to set the people free to impose such strict and daft regulations on local authorities is going to the limits of nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consider the sort of companies that will be regarded as influenced companies, it seems that the only people who will benefit from the clause will be bureaucrats. Those who will lose out will be not only the members of local authorities, but all who are privileged to represent the public as councillors or Members of Parliament. For example, the Victor Dock Company in Humberside is a joint venture between Hull city council and Bellway Urban Renewals Limited. The Minister commended that scheme when he said recently:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is first class example of the public and private sector working together. As I have said on many occasions the perfect partnership is central Government, local government and private industry."</p></blockquote>
The partnerships that the Minister and the Secretary of State for Wales are praising are bound to be adversely affected by the clause. Other examples include the National Exhibition Centre Limited in Birmingham, Birmingham Heartlands Limited, Manchester Ringway Development plc and many others. They will be affected by the clause because the controls that we have fought during the past few weeks which will be imposed on local authorities will also be imposed on those companies which at the moment have some freedom, not to avoid restrictions, but to develop a relationship between the private and public sectors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman say what disadvantageous controls, other than capital controls, he believes are likely to fall on those companies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The capital controls are sufficiently disadvantageous to be included in the amendment to ensure that people know that those controls will be extended to the companies. That is sufficient for us to oppose the clause dramatically and directly. Therefore, the capital restrictions to which we drew the public's attention last week should be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0848">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>779</span>
I accept the Minister's argument on the difference between an influenced and a controlled company. But the restrictions that will apply to controlled companies are much wider. They are sufficient for us to criticise the clause and to argue for these three amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 526, 527 and 528 and will pursue the same line as the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy). It would be reasonable for the Minister to argue that 49 per cent. influence on a company may mean effective control, which is partly why I propose 40 per cent. instead of 49 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that if three groups come together—an association, a private business and a local authority—genuine partnership between the three will be ruled out by the Minister's proposal. If local authority companies are to be effective, people will wish to move them towards the controls on influence. A limit of 20 per cent. is so low that it will be difficult for genuine partnerships to operate and act effectively for local people. Forty per cent. would not transform a company to a controlled one and I do not understand why that should be not be acceptable to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the problem is not so much that the Government disagree with us on the usefulness of many of those companies and their functions, and the value of a partnership between the private and public sector, but that they have not considered the matter from that point of view. They have considered it from the point of view of controlling the investment of public money. That is their attitude to local authority work as a whole. The result is especially restrictive controls on the so-called influenced authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For real influence to be exercised, the figure should be higher than 20 per cent. Perhaps one third would have been an appropriate amendment. That would have met my main concern that it should be possible for a genuine partnership to take place, particularly where three groups are involved. As an attempt to meet the Minister's expressed intention, 40 per cent. would be suitable. It would meet most cases and would allow the flexibility that may be necessitated by definitional problems. The local authority interest is so broadly defined that difficulties may arise if companies accidentally move over the limits that the Government set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment, and that it will be acceptable to Tory Back Bench Members. It would not drastically affect the Bill, but would bring it into line with the reality of the companies' operations and their need for flexibility and independence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief and, I hope, not tedious. This is the appropriate point at which to raise one aspect of the worries of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce about the clause and this provision. I have passed on to the Minister a note from the association. I declare, once again, my interest as a consultant to that organisation, by which I was employed before I became a Member of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>780</span>
The association is worried that the interpretation of influence is insufficiently flexible to match the variety of circumstances. The point was made by the two hon. Members who spoke earlier. A 20 per cent. cut-off point for shareholding could, under different circumstances, be a controlling interest or, at the other extreme, of little influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal factor is the composition of the other 80 per cent. interest. In the hands of a multitude of small shareholders, the 20 per cent. holding will hold sway. However, the limit is operative in the context of mergers legislation, which is not generally the context in which local authorities operate. They usually have a limited number of partners. They are often closed companies and the local authority holding is not only a minority holding, but may be smaller than that of the other partners. For reasons of political acceptability, a 51:49 or a 50:50 shareholding arrangement is often entered into. By definition, this is adopted to prevent the authority from having sole control. It ensures the continued responsiveness of the company to commercial criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) referred to the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham. I do not know the proportions, but I know that the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce and Industry has a considerable interest—financial and in the widest possible sense—in the development, use and future of that centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to capital controls. The consultation paper preceding the legislation strongly suggested that the capital controls applicable to authorities will extend to companies subject to local authority finance. That is a source of considerable difficulty because it means that the capital programmes of those companies, which may be sizeable and be only slightly directed towards the authority's objectives, will be counted against the authority's control total.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a real inhibition on the activities of partnership companies. Their basis is often the exploitation of land assets in which the authority has a major stake. The reason for the company approach is to bring to bear private sector commercial resources through equity or borrowing, which would not be available to the authority acting alone. That route may be blocked by the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will be able to respond to the worries that I have expressed on behalf of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, it is important to draw to the attention of the Committee the fact that a company does not fall into this category unless it satisfied two criteria. Local authority representation of 20 per cent. or more is not sufficient for the provision to be triggered. The company must also have significant local authority business involved in what it does. It is difficult to see how a company that meets those two criteria is not influenced by the local authority to the degree that we specify in the category. The influence would then be sufficient for it to be recognised in the way in which capital was gained for the company.

12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson) that there is a real problem here. It is no good ignoring the fact that such companies are set up to avoid the capital control arrangements for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pressed the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) to say whether there was anything else in the provision that worried him. I think that his words "and other things" was an embellishment and that what really worries him is the capital effect of capital controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be odd if the capital input were to be substantially influenced by the local authority—because it was doing 80 per cent. of the business, and had provided 23 per cent. of the directors—yet the capital involvement was outwith any capital controls. The hon. Member for Torfaen should be concentrating on the amount of local authority capital allocations. No doubt we shall disagree about that figure at some stage. We should not be seeking to structure companies so that they continue to be controlled or significantly influenced by local authorities. Rather, we should be deciding how much national capital expenditure government should be involved in, and what proportion of that should be spent by local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister were to invert that argument, how would he answer the charge that housing associations that have relationships with local authorities and could be deemed to be influenced by council members on their management committees should therefore come under the same capital constraints?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me push the logic of the clause further. Does the Minister suggest that the capital expenditure of housing associations should be monitored and judged by local authorities before they set up their programmes? That is the logical implication of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Those are the doctrinaire implications. I am discussing the practical implications. A public company should be one in the full sense of the word, with the accountability of a public company. A local authority company should have the public accountability of a local authority. Some bodies lie between the two, and the clause attempts to draw reasonable dividing lines between the company that is significantly influenced and that which is not. It is difficult to know where to draw the line. The hon. Member for Torfaen is right to question that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested to see that the Liberal party has sought to draw a line somewhere between the Government's proposition and that of the Labour party, but the mathematics of the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) must be wrong. If he is to be as even-handed as he normally is, he would be asking not for 40 per cent. but for 35 per cent., because that is as nearly as possible midway between 20 per cent. and 49 per cent. It is difficult to get it exactly right, but I think that the hon. Gentleman would admit that he picked a figure somewhat at random.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>782</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was random in that the hon. Gentleman thought that it was reasonable, but he gave no comparable circumstances in which it would be a reasonable answer. The Government tried to find a reasonable figure based upon comparability. The figure of 20 per cent. is used as the means of deciding whether a company is significantly influenced about takeovers and mergers, in the context of the effects of monopoly activities, and in discussions about associated companies. Legislation and self-policing uses the 20 per cent. level as a reasonable trigger. We chose 20 per cent. because it seems to have been accepted in the private sector as reasonable for many years. I do not see the basis for the hon. Gentleman's figure of 40 per cent., nor for my suggested 35 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To clarify the issue in the Minister's mind, the figure was not based on the difference between the Government and the Labour party. It seemed more reasonable to base the figure on two fifths rather than one fifth. With takeovers, there may be many individual shareholders and a block of 20 per cent. could provide a basis for control. That does not apply where the relative strength of the partners may be influential. I did say that one third might be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention only underlines the difficulty of fixing the level, but one third is nearer to the Government than to the Opposition. I cannot escape the feeling that the hon. Gentleman is proceeding along the well known Liberal line, which is to look at other people's positions and find somewhere between. That is the real rationale of what is being put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be more sensible to accept what we have always thought to be a reasonable test in the private sector. It applies to companies with a large number of shareholders, to those where shareholders may be in large groupings and to associated company status, where the 20 per cent. can easily be used. The other 80 per cent. might be divided among only a few people. The hon. Gentleman's comparison is not reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a local authority has a 20 per cent. holding and the company is doing a significant amount of business with the local authority, it must have significant influence of the sort that would be odd if it were placed outside the capital arrangements. The Labour party suggests 49 per cent. If that were the case, almost any company could be totally controlled by the local authority, able to spend money and able to raise capital, and outsiders would know that it was backed by the local authority and thus could escape capital controls.

There is nothing wrong with capital controls. Any Government who seek to run a sensible economic policy—whether Socialist or free enterprise—must have some general control of public sector capital spending. Mr. Crosland was as aware of that as is my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. The issue is not whether there should be controls, but the total

	<span class='label label-info column'>783</span>
amount of control and whether there is sufficient control for local authorities to do their job properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall no doubt argue about the extent of such control, but once it has been established it would be foolish to allow a local authority to avoid it and thereby reduce the amount of money available to other local authorities that might be in much greater need and whose allocations would have to be cut to take into account the misuse of the system. To allow companies to become a substitute—I do not want to use an improper word such as "front"—for direct local government expenditure would be to avoid the system. I would not like that to happen, and I therefore hope that the balance between 20 per cent. and the proportion of local government business is about right, based as it is upon rationale rather than on random figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister defended the 20 per cent. figure on the basis that there is a relevant equivalent in takeover practice. Is it not also the case that under company law, levels of 25 per cent., 50 per cent. and 75 per cent. are also set, for similar reasons to those advanced by the Minister for controlling companies in this case? Will he tell us why he chose 20 per cent., rather than the 25 per cent. that is generally used in company law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We realised that that was not the only criterion for the purposes of the Bill. We had two different criteria, which interreacted and we had to meet both. It seemed to us that we needed the lower figure because we also insisted that it did not count if the business done was sufficiently diverse. There is no such second area in company law, so we were trying to put it right in that sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agreed entirely with my right hon. Friend's final remark about the importance of capital controls and not having arrangements that local authorities could avoid. But will he reconsider his response to an interesting intervention by the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the logic of what my right hon. Friend said did not drive him to include housing associations within the framework of capital controls. My right hon. Friend replied that that would be "doctrinaire". But what if a local authority sells land worth £10 million to a housing
	<span class='label label-info column'>784</span>
association, which then borrows the money from a building society and that debt is guaranteed by the local authority? Let us assume that the local authority also guarantees to the building society any revenue deficit on that transaction and that the local authority insists on nominating 100 per cent. of the tenants housed in that development. Inevitably, the local authority would pay the housing benefit to the tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a transaction ought to be caught by the arrangements in this clause. Indeed, my right hon. Friend said that it would be "odd" if a local authority that exerted significant influence over a transaction could evade capital controls. However, in the circumstances that I have just described the whole transaction would be outside the Bill. Its provisions would not bite. But clause 58 does bite on many other transactions where the local authority has much less influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had some sympathy with the view of the hon. Member for Leeds, West—that the logic of my right hon. Friend's approach is to include housing associations, especially where there is a close relationship between them and local authorities. In Ealing, as my right hon. Friend knows, the housing associations are almost sub-committees of the council. I found it slightly odd when my right hon. Friend said that it would be "doctrinaire" to include them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Conservative Members—and, I suspect, quite a few Conservative councillors—would like the Minister to do exactly what the hon. Member for Leeds, West, suggested. Such action would not be doctrinaire. It would be entirely logical, highly welcome and consistent with the Government's overall approach to the control of public expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing (Sir G.
