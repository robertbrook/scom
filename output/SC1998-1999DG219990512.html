	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That the Committee has considered the draft Social Security Commissioners (Procedure) Regulations 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say what a great pleasure it is to have you here, Mr. Winterton, to supervise our thorough and detailed consideration of the pages of regulations that the Committee is about to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Forth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bromley and Chislehurst)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How long do we have?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) indicates his enthusiasm for the process. I am sure that all hon. Members will welcome his detailed contributions to our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before going on to discuss the regulations, it may help the Committee if I outline their background. The regulations are made in the context of the major modernisation and reform of the decision-making and appeals procedures for social security benefits and child support that were introduced by the Social Security Act 1998, which received Royal Assent on 21 May 1998. The Act aims to deliver a clearer, more streamlined and accessible welfare system, with emphasis on delivering real improvements for claimants, particularly to ensure more straightforward and helpful notification and guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Detailed provision for the first stage of the new decision-making procedures set out in the 1998 Act have already been made in the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999, considered by the Committee on 22 March. First, that involves major reforms of the decision-taking process. All first tier decisions will be taken on behalf of the Secretary of State and there will be a new internal DSS dispute resolution procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After that, as now, there will be two formal levels of appeal provisions. The five existing tribunal jurisdictions are replaced by a single, unified appeal tribunal with a single set of powers to determine all cases. The Lord Chancellor will appoint a president of appeal tribunals and set up a panel of people qualified in law, medicine, finance and the needs of the disabled. The qualifications of the members of each tribunal who will be chosen will match the needs of each case. The intention is to make the procedures simpler. New
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
powers are being introduced to enable tribunals to correct their own decisions, reducing the number of appeals that need to be taken further. We intend to reduce the number of appeals made to commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations put in place consequential procedures for social security commissioners, who are effectively the final tier of the appeal process and to whom appeals are made only on points of law. Similar regulations dealing with child support provisions, which were subject to the negative resolution procedure, have already been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to put on record my appreciation of the work of his honour Judge Machin, the chief commissioner of the social security and child support commissioners, and his colleagues for their valuable help in developing the regulations. I shall now explain the content of the regulations in slightly more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations replace the Social Security Commissioners Procedure Regulations 1987. They aim to improve procedures in two ways. Most important, they are simpler and clearer. As many appellants represent themselves, it is important that the regulations explain the procedures clearly. The current regulations were drafted in 1987, and despite being amended in 1992 and 1997, the language could have been clearer. We have taken the opportunity to recast them in rather plainer English. The requirement for new regulations also provided a valuable opportunity for a thorouh review, which has allowed us to clarify a number of aspects of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions for time limits have been simplified as part of the arrangements for a more consistent and streamlined appeals procedure. One of the problems that appellants faced was the confusing array of time limits, first at the tribunal level and then before the comissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members considered the principles behind the changes when debating the earlier tribunal regulations. The regulations have undergone major simplification. We have adopted a consistent approach to the two appeal levels. It is important for appellants to bear in mind that they now have a month for each stage. For the commissioners, that means that the current time limit of 42 days in which to apply for leave to appeal where an applicant has not been granted leave at tribunal level, and in which to appeal where leave has been obtained, are both replaced. However, that does not mean that applicants will have only a month to decide whether to appeal. They will first be told the result of their appeal to the tribunal. They will then have one month to seek a full statement of the reasons for that, and another month to decide whether to appeal further—making two months in all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The limit of 30 days for submitting a written observation and making an application to set aside a decision will also be changed to one month. Time limits for a notice of hearing and a notice to a witness, now 10 and seven days respectively, will change to 14 days. Those time-limit changes are all in line with the changes at tribunal level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations contain their own transitional provisions to allow for the phased introduction of the new systems, ensuring that an appellant whose case is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
already pending should not be prejudiced by the changes. The commissioners also retain their unfettered power to accept late applications for leave to appeal and late appeals for special reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opportunity has been taken to make express provision, in regulation 6, for a case to be dealt with by another commissioner if the original commissioner is unable to do so because of long absence or death, so removing a doubt under the previous rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Procedural provisions governing the special jurisdiction of the commissioners under the Forfeiture Act 1982 have also been simplified. The 1982 Act requires any question of whether social security benefits have been forfeited in cases of unlawful killing to be determined by social security commissioners. However, such proceedings would not be covered by the Social Security Act 1998 without making special provision. The regulations therefore prescribe the Social Security Act as a relevant enactment for that purpose, and regulations 14 and 15 set out the relevant procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also made some specific procedural improvements. In addition to the commissioners' current power, the regulations will now enable commissioners to strike out a proceeding for abuse of process as well as for want of prosecution. In both cases, the parties will be given the opportunity to make representations before any such action is taken. The aim is to enable commissioners to dispose expeditiously of cases where the appellant declines to take any step or where the proceedings have been improperly brought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the social security jurisdiction, many thousands of individual claimants' cases can sometimes depend on a point of legal principle awaiting a test case ruling from the commissioners or the higher courts. The 1998 Act therefore provides for handling appeals that raise similar issues and depend also on a test case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 21 sets out the minimum procedural requirements for the Secretary of State to identify those cases already before the commissioner where the new procedure is to be operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listed the main changes in the package. Unless specifically required, I do not intend to burden the Committee by going over each drafting change—although I could, especially as they largely simplify the language of the existing regulations. The new regulations should be easier for people to understand and use. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the Minister in welcoming you to our Committee, Mr. Winterton. I also acknowledge the valuable work of Judge Machin in preparing the rules.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steve Webb 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Northavon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to be almost as brief, although I am rather less satisfied. Today, Mr. Winterton, is the first time that I have had the privilege of your chairing a Committee of which I am a member. I look forward to it happening again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 13 deals with how long people have to decide whether to appeal to the commissioners. The Minister said that appellants have a month to receive notification of the outcome of the appeal and a further month to decide whether to appeal to the commissioners. I was a member of the Standing Committee that considered the Social Security Act 1998, in which it was always being said that people should have adequate time to make such decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The further one goes in the appeal process, the more complex the issues become. Trivial cases are dealt with by adjudication officers; the more tricky cases are dealt with by appeal tribunals; only the knottiest legal issues reach the commissioners. The average benefit claimant who is the subject of a contentious decision on appeal might, therefore, need more than a month to decide whether it is worth pursuing an appeal to the commissioners and to access legal advice. Advice services, especially free advice services, on which benefits claimants may rely, may have long waiting lists. It might be a month before the legal specialist at the citizens advice bureau can go through the paperwork.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I understand why it is desirable to streamline the appeals process, a balance must be struck. I am worried that too short a time period has been set. There seems to be a view that the door should be closed if people do not act quickly. However, there may be good reasons for their not acting quickly when they nevertheless want to pursue the matter. Appeals and references to the commissioner can be struck out for want of prosecution, but there may be good reasons why it has taken someone a long time to be able to deal with such matters. For some social security benefits, entitlement may come at a time of personal difficulty, such as bereavement, illness or family breakdown. All those reason would explain why the process might take some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is often said that social security legislation is among the most complex in many respects. We are dealing with people, possibly at a difficult time in their lives, who need good quality legal advice in order to discover whether it is worth approaching the commissioners, and I am worried that 30 days may not strike the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 13(2) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A Commissioner may for special reasons accept a late notice of appeal."</p></blockquote>
The key question for the Committee is what are those special reasons. Obviously, we were all grateful that the Minister did not elaborate on every paragraph of the regulations, but I hope that we shall allow him to elaborate on that one. In what circumstances might a late appeal to the commissioners be allowed? We would be reassured if we felt that that provision will be applied liberally, for want of a better word—although
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
there is no better word, really—so that anyone who had a good reason for acting after the 30-day period would be granted leave to appeal. Having noted that reservation, I look forward to the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.42 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come to the Committee with the profound disadvantage of not being a lawyer. My examination of the regulations will therefore have to be from a lay point of view. However, I hope that the Committee will concede that that will not necessarily be a disadvantage, because how the regulations are cast is crucial to lay people. People can represent themselves, and, as hon. Members know, often do. The regulations' contents are therefore crucial. How they will operate with regard to ordinary members of the public, as opposed to experts and those who are legally qualified, is even more important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the effort that has been made in making the regulations as clear and comprehensible as possbile. The Minister and his officials should be praised for that. I have only a few simple and straightforward questions for the Minister, simply to satisfy myself that the regulations head in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Minister's attention to regulation 5(2)(b), which states that the commissioner may
	<br><blockquote><p>"expedite, postpone or adjourn any proceedings."</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members will know that those are some of the circumstances in which greatest difficulty may be caused to lay members of the public, who may have gone to some trouble to prepare their representations. They will, by definition, be anxious about the outcome of such proceedings, and often have a great deal, emotionally and financially, invested in them. Will they be protected from the frivolous—that is perhaps the wrong word; I shall say needless—postponement or adjournment of proceedings? What does "expedite" mean in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have racked my brains and cannot think how a commissioner could expedite proceedings in a way that would maintain the protection necessary for the layman representing himself or herself. That simple word "expedite" sounds attractive, implying efficiency and all sorts of good, modern things, but we are talking about people's rights to represent something that is important to them. We have a particular duty to ensure that no one is disadvantaged or has their rights trampled on in any way. I would therefore like to know more about what lies behind the word, how and in what circumstances the expedition of proceedings by a commissioner might occur and what protection will ensure that no one's rights will be trampled on by expediting the proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was my first worry about the text. My eye then lit on regulation 7, which states
	<br><blockquote><p>"The following functions of Commissioners may be exercised by legally qualified authorised officers, to be known as legal officers to the Commissioners—"</p></blockquote>
Under paragraph (d) of that regulation, the commissioners can postpone a hearing under
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
regulation 5, and under paragraph (f) they can waive irregularities under regulation 27. So we are talking about powers being delegated to the legal officers to the commissioners, who are no doubt excellent people, which is therefore already at one remove of accountability. The regulations do not state whether the legal officers must get specific authorisation from the commission; as I read it, they can act under their own authority and postpone a hearing—one of the greatest causes of stress and distress to people taking their case to the commission. We should know more about the circumstances in which it is envisaged that the hearing can be postponed, and whether any redress or protection is provided for the layman who may have gone to considerable expense and trouble, perhaps travelling a great distance, only to find that the hearing is postponed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to an explanation about paragraph (f), which deals with the function of:
	<br><blockquote><p>"waiving irregularities under regulation 27 in connection with any matter being dealt with by a legal officer".</p></blockquote>
That sounds like a prettey wide-ranging power, given that it is being carried out by legal officers, not the commissioner. We therefore need to be satisfied about the meaning of "waiving irregularities" and the impact that that might have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 24(4) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If any party to whom notice of a hearing has been sent fails to appear at the hearing, the Commissioner may proceed with the case in that party's absence, or may give directions with a view to the determination of the case."</p></blockquote>
That worries me because I can imagine legitimate reasons why someone might fail to appear at the hearing, ranging from illness and transport difficulties to all sorts of issues with which other members of the Committee will be more familiar than I. That provision gives no comfort or protection such as the provision that, for example, an explanation may be sought or reasonable investigation made, before the commissioner proceeds with a case in the party's absence. The regulation says simply that if the person fails to appear, the commissioner may proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I hope he does not, the Minister may tell me: "Don't worry, trust me"; he may even say, "Trust the commissioners". That would not satisfy me. The onus in the regulations should have been put on the Minister and the Committee to satisfy themselves that vulnerable lay people representing themselves in difficult circumstances are given maximum protection from capricious decisions. You, Mr. Winterton, perhaps know better than most members of the Committee that people whom I shall style bureaucrats occasionally make capricious decisions. Some members of the Committee may resent my labelling commissioners bureaucrats, but how else can they be described? I have no doubt that they are all fine, upstanding people of great integrity, but mistakes can be made. The regulations give no safeguard against a commissioner's capricious decision to proceed with a case in a party's absence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years that I have been in the House, I have had many cases—as no doubt have other hon. Members—of aggrieved constituents who are unable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
to appear, for whatever reason, in cases such as those we envisage under the regulations; who feel that the system has ridden roughshod over their rights and has not given them an opportunity to have their say. I have heard that complaint more times than I would have liked. I looked in the regulations for protection in such circumstances and found none. I hope that the Minister can reassure me more than adequately on that.

Finally, regulation, 33 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to paragraph (2), an application to a Commissioner under section 15 of the Act for leave to appeal against a decision of a Commissioner shall be made in writing, stating the grounds of the application, within three months from the date on which the applicant was sent written notice of the decision."</p></blockquote>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I discourage my right hon. Friend from prefacing his statement that he is not a lawyer by saying that that puts him at a disadvantage. It puts him at no disadvantage; in fact, for the very reasons he cited, it probably gives him an advantage: it gives him a better insight into the mind of the lay consumer of the service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has readily recognised that no one in the Committee—some would say the House—is more inexpert than I and that there is therefore no one more qualified to represent the inexpert. I take my hon. Friend's comment as a high compliment and will complete my questions in that spirit. He will see from my next two or three sentences the extent of my lack of expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot believe that I have read regulation 33 correctly; I feel that I must have made a mistake. It states that someone who wants to appeal must make an application to the commissioner. How can someone ask a commissioner for permission to appeal against something the commissioner has decided? That cannot be right. I therefore ask, in the confident knowledge that I will be told that I am wrong, whether it can possibly be true that we will have a system whereby a commissioner makes a decision and then decides whether to allow an appeal against it. That would be absurd and would make a nonsense of the appeal mechanism. In my inexpert, layman's mind, the whole point of the mechanism is that, if I am dissatisfied with a decision made by one level of authority, I must be able to go round or beyond that authority to exercise my right to appeal. I want to be reassured that the commissioner cannot decide whether to allow an appeal against himself under regulation 33.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are my simple questions about the regulations. I am sure that, as usual, the Minister will be able to amply and expertly to reassure the Committee that nothing in the regulations should worry us and that lay people will be able to deal with the commissioners confidently on the basis of the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, but I share his concern about regulation 24(4). He makes a telling point. I am confident that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to put our minds at rest, but I hope that he will take the points that have been made seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be totally wrong for those very vulnerable people to lose their right of appeal in a seemingly simple and categoric way, such as that implied in the regulations. We have all dealt with cases in which witnesses or other people have not been able to attend appeals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will understand that the point made by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst is not partisan or party political; it is shared by all Members who have tried to achieve justice for their constituents in those difficult circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.56 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I thank all members of the Committee for their attention, especially those who have raised various issues, with which I shall endeavour to deal. The hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) is an acknowledged expert in such matters. I would not claim the same, but I hope that I can put his mind at rest about the time limits. He conceded that a balance had to be struck. Obviously, in determining any time limit, it is important that the eventual outcome should be certain. Fixing any time limit is bound to be an exercise in judgment and in striking a balance. We hope that we have struck the right balance in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that people have only one month in which to appeal. However, those who have applied for leave to appeal have a month to prepare their case and generally they will have shown their grounds for appeal as part of the leave process. In practice, they will have two months in which to settle the appropriate legal points that they want to raise before appealing. I tried to explain that during my opening speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect, the leave process doubles the length of time involved and should be sufficient to allow people to secure appropriate legal advice. Obviously, such advice will not be necessary in every case. As the hon. Gentleman knows, it should be possible to conduct such cases before tribunals without necessarily taking legal advice, although I recognise the benefits that legal advice can bring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the extent of the discretion to allow late appeals. Nothing in the regulations will change the current practice—I am told that it was established as long ago as 1948—in which the commissioners' discretion is completely unlimited. Therefore, a commissioner can allow late appeals, provided that the appellant has sufficiently explained why they are late. I can think of no other appeals process in which such remarkably broad discretion is allowed. It is necessary for appellants to show good cause as to why they are late in appealing, but they should not be disadvantaged so long as there is a proper reason why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
The first point made by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst was about the meaning of the word "expedite" in regulation 5(2)(b). He was rightly concerned that no one should be disadvantaged by that provision. I assure him that the use of the word "expedite" is intended to benefit claimants and appellants. If a commissioner sees from the papers a clearly meritorious appeal—a great deal of information is supplied in written form in these cases—he or she can then expedite the appeal by granting it at an early stage in the procedure. That will certainly be of benefit. There may be other, more difficult circumstances when someone is ill, or has a terminal illness, for example. Again, it is important that powers are available to expedite the appeal, so that it can be resolved quickly to the benefit of the appellant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. Will he reassure me that there are no circumstances in which a commissioner can arbitrarily expedite a refusal? I can see that it would be advantageous to a claimant or appellant for something favourable to be expedited, but it is possible that it could be expedited, at the commissioner's behest, to the disadvantage of the claimant. Is there a safety mechanism to guard against that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, on further appeal, an appellant is ultimately proved right and it is demonstrated on a point of law that he has a case, and were the matter to have been expedited, a number of legal procedures would be available to a disadvantaged claimant to challenge the decision on expedition. Normally speaking, if a procedural irregularity works to the advantage of an appellant, all well and good, but if it works to his disadvantage, a range of remedies are available to challenge the decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the person get legal aid in those circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the procedures that I was thinking of, such as a judicial review of the decision, he probably would—assuming that he was suitably qualified. Nothing that I say is meant to encourage anyone to seek legal aid in such circumstances. Clearly, if there has been a breach of the appropriate procedure in the conduct of a tribunal such as the right hon. Gentleman suggests, a number of legal remedies will be available to someone to challenge it. The provisions are generally intended to provide powers for the commissioners to deal generously and favourably with those who appear before them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked about the role of legal officers who are seconded to the commissioner's office as part of the Government legal service. Their responsibilities are essentially to provide judicial assistance and legal advice. They are lawyers who have the responsibility to sort out the complex law that is now part of our social security system. Their job is to provide advice that should assist claimants, and they are responsible for ensuring that the appropriate law is
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
administered properly by the tribunal. That means that they are given certain delegated responsibilities. They are authorised by the regulations to act and decide on certain interlocutory issues, subject always to the supervision of the commissioner on appeal. The nearest comparison is with justices' clerks, who are responsible for providing legal advice as part of the overall framework of ensuring that the law is right when it is applied to particular cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regulation 27 states specifically that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Commissioner, before reaching his decision, may waive the irregularity".</p></blockquote>
However, the Minister seems to be saying that the legal officers have the power to waive that irregularity. Is the Minister satisfied that there is a proper degree of accountability and control over the important power of waiving irregularities when that is undertaken by legal officers, rather than the commissioner, as specified in regulation 27?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am, because each of these responsibilities and decisions are subject to appeal. There is a proper process of supervision. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The right hon. Gentleman does not seem entirely satisfied, but that is how our entire legal system, including tribunals, is supervised. If mistakes are made, they can be corrected on appeal. The sort of mistakes that are likely to be dealt with are mistakes of law, rather than simple questions of fact about basic entitlement. It is a fairly sophisticated procedure, in which it is right that the assistance of legally qualified people should be available, and which, ultimately, will benefit those who appear before the tribunal. It is not always necessary for someone to seek his own independent legal advice. Although it is advantageous and may be beneficial, legal advice also ensures that the appropriate law is applied. That is a characteristic of most tribunal procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked about the circumstances in which a hearing might be postponed. It would normally be at the request of the appellant. There are a range of reasons why someone might request a postponement, such as seeking further evidence, but in most cases it will be because of illness or an inability to attend on a particular day. It is necessary for all these powers to be available to avoid the injustice about which the right hon. Gentleman is properly concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He and my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) asked about regulation 24(4). This is not a new provision; it has been continued into the existing rules and has been there for some time. I am not defending it; just because it has existed for a long time and does not necessarily mean that it is a good thing. I am part of a modernising Government who are committed to radical change in these processes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Joined up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that, but given a good example, I would agree to that as well. The right hon. Gentleman is also willing to blow away some cobwebs when the occasion demands it. I am not defending the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
provision simply on the ground of its antiquity. Having existed for some time without serious challenge, it has obviously worked well in practice. It has been around a long time—no doubt the right hon. Gentleman supported it previously—so, the Government are not introducing a provision that is likely to do harm. Most cases are decided without the attendance of the appellant and are resolved from the papers. The measure provides a judicial discretion on whether to proceed without the attendance of the party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely satisfied with that. Surely the Minister must distinguish between proceedings that can properly take place without the appellant being present, but with his knowledge and consent, in an expedited way, and this different category, which involves a party to whom notice of a hearing has been sent. There is an expectation that the party wishes to attend, but
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Commissioner may proceed with the case in that party's absence, or may give directions with a view to the determination of the case."</p></blockquote>
The implication is that, even if the party has been sent the invitation and is expected to attend, but is unable to do so, the case will still proceed. That is on my mind, rather than the routine case that proceeds without there being any intention or possibility of the party being present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I can only describe the normal arrangements. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that these procedures are subject to appeal and the provisions of the European convention on domestic law. They are already subject to our international obligations under that convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no circumstances in which a commissioner, in exercising his discretionary power, would use it to the disadvantage of someone making an appeal. The procedures are fairly sophisticated, so I cannot see how that could be used to damage the position of individual appellants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the right hon. Gentleman asked about regulation 33 and leave to appeal. That area might benefit from a modest legal study. I am sure that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Gamier) will confirm that it is quite common for appeals to be made to a court that has previously dismissed a certain case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is ridiculous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not exactly an appeal—it would be a request for leave to appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, a request. That is a perfectly common process and is carried out daily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman may ask how objectivity can possibly be maintained. Clearly, there will generally be two sides to the argument in relation to appeals on points of law, otherwise matters would not have proceeded to that extent. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that, in relation to points of law, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
commissioners will be able to recognise that their decision may not be entirely the final decision in a particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, even if leave to appeal is refused by the commissioner, that leave can be renewed before the Court of Appeal, which will supervise commissioners' activity on points of law. Therefore, the commissioner's decision may allow the appeal to proceed, even if the commissioner himself refuses the appeal and refuses to leave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to think that the Minister rather wishes that my right hon. Friend were a member of the Standing Committee considering the Access to Justice Bill. Only yesterday, we discussed routes of appeal in that Committee. The Government are seeking to truncate the appeal system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is outrageous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is outrageous, but the Government intend to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what the hon. and learned Gentleman said yesterday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend may wish to observe tomorrow's proceedings in the Committee considering the Access to Justice Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and learned Gentleman intervening on me?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough is intervening on the Minister's winding-up speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is clearly being wound up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minister says may be true today. However, when the Access to Justice Bill is enacted, the appeal route may well be slightly different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst had the privilege of being in this Room yesterday to debate the Access to Justice Bill, he would have witnessed the hon. and learned Member for Harborough utter not a single word of complaint about the changes to the appeal process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the hon. and learned Gentleman spent the night studying those provisions and regrets that he did not make a complaint in that Committee, or whether he simply dreamt up his complaint for this Committee? Whatever the answer, we cannot rely on what he has just said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has really got me going, so I shall jolly well debate such matters for a considerable period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We did not consider the regulations in Committee yesterday. That would not have been in order. However, the position is now somewhat reversed, as we have now come to the question of appeals in the social security system. I will not pursue the matter further, although my right hon.

I understand that the head of the new appeals system will provide the Secretary of State with an annual report.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
