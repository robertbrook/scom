	<div class='title'>GRANT-MAINTAINED SCHOOLS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Amendment proposed [15 December 1992]:</i> No. 235, in page 8, line 42, at the end to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>'and in determining the amounts of such grants it shall be the duty of the funding authority to exercise its powers with a view to ensuring minimum standards of provision for sufficient books and equipment, the maintenance of school buildings and sufficient resources to limit class sizes to a level prescribed by orders from time to time made by the Secretary of State.'—
	<i>[Mr. Steinberg.]</i></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Martin and all the Committee members back after what I am sure we all agree was a well-deserved break. I look forward to stimulating and productive discussion of the Bill under the terms of the sensible timetable on which we have just agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we broke up for Christmas, we were considering an amendment, which was discussed at some length, which would allow clause 15 to be used to determine the amount of books and equipment for schools and the appropriate level of maintenance for school buildings and class sizes. However well intentioned that amendment was—Opposition Members explained it at length and with passion—the Committee is neither the appropriate place in which nor the vehicle with which to introduce such a concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) implied that there was not necessarily a relationship in education between resources and results or between class sizes and results. That issue is now beginning to be discussed in a sensible and sensitive way. As I recall, he also agreed that local education authorities themselves differ greatly in their circumstances. That is the key to the problem with the amendment. The amendment, rather arbitrarily, implies that the funding agency should get involved in the detail of the allocation of resources and in judgments about books, equipment, building and class sizes that are rightly the province either of the local education authorities—as it is at the moment—or of the schools themselves in the growing grant-maintained sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who has a passing knowledge of the way in which Government and financing work knows that there is an overall allocation of resources to a particular sector and within that, an allocation or distribution of resources must be made. I advise strongly against people believing that they could drive such matters from the bottom up. It is impossible to say to 24,000 very different schools in very different circumstances, "Here is a desirable level of resource; here is what is necessary for the maintenance of books, equipment and so on. Build that up from the bottom and arrive at a figure at the top." The schools would then say, "Well, let's have it then."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Opposition Members have an intimate and expert knowledge of the way in which LEAs work and know perfectly well that an authority cannot be run on the basis of saying to all the schools that if they provide a list of what they need they will get it. Life is not like that at LEA level or at national level. The implication of the amendment is that life is like that, but it is not and, I suspect, never will be, despite the wishes of many members

of the Committee. The amendment, well-intentioned though it is, should be rejected, perhaps with some regret, so that we can get on with the business before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply was disappointing. I thought that as we were in a new year, he would be a little more magnanimous. However, it seems that his responses to the amendments will be in the same vein as they were last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not, as the Minister suggested, attempting to lay down specific expenditure for each school. The amendment would require a minimum expenditure for each school and it would then be left to the individual school. I shall not pursue the point because I realise that we must get on quickly. However, I should like to show how the case for grant-maintained status was misrepresented to parents in an area and what the consequences were of that school becoming grant maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The governors of Scotby school near Carlisle in Cumbria sent leaflets to parents suggesting that the school should opt out. They promised that it it became grant maintained, more money would be available for books, the toilets would be redecorated and more money would be spent on staff. Because of the promises made, the school became grant maintained on 1 September 1992. Section 99 notices were immediately served on two teachers and formal redundancy discussions took place: the only way that those promises could be delivered was to sack staff. One of the two teachers given compulsory redundancy notices has now left and has a new job, the other was due to leave at the end of last year. The school was negotiating with the local education authority to give that teacher a part-time contract. I do not imagine that the LEA will be prepared to get the school out of the mess that it has got itself into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The governors have reissued the cleaning contract and have sacked teachers. Other staff have been told that their contracts will be changed soon. To make it easier to sack staff, a three-month notice period at the end of the summer term will be negotiated. The school went grant maintained with promises of more expenditure. To carry out their promises, the governors have had to get rid of staff and change the way in which the school is run. That is what happens when no minimum standards are laid down. The amendment would establish a minimum standard for all grant-maintained schools. I shall press the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 101, in page 9, line 28, leave out 'passed at a' and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'which appeared on the agenda paper of a governing body meeting, was circulated at least 21 days in advance of that meeting, and was passed at the same.'.</p></blockquote>
At the start of a new year, I wish you the compliments of the season, Mr. Martin. I hope that you had a good rest at Christmas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment sets out a backstop position. It would deal with the Government's intention to abolish the option of a second vote in a governors' meeting on whether to hold a ballot about opting out. I was surprised by the Government's intention to remove the second ballot option. During debates on the Education Bill in 1987–88, the right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker), who was then Secretary of State, went out of his way to accept an Opposition amendment about a second ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, in providing 21 days' notice, is one way to retain the purpose of a second ballot. That purpose could be lost if clause 17 is unamended. It may be helpful for hon. Members who did not serve on the Committee that considered the Education Bill in 1987–88 to hear the words of the right hon. Member for Mole Valley, who had the good grace to attend Committee meetings because he believed that the measure was important. It is a pity that the present Secretary of State has not followed that example. However, I shall not say that we must "put up with" a junior Minister, because we are pleased that at least someone from the Department of Education is in Committee. The right hon. Member for Mole Valley emphasised the importance of the decision to hold a ballot on becoming a grant-maintained school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tabled amendment No. 825 at the time, which proposed a second ballot. The then Secretary of State said about it:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Amendment No. 825 has scarcely been debated and I have some sympathy with it. I recognise that the vote may be finely balanced and that there are good arguments for allowing governors a period of reflection before committing themselves. I am aware that a provision is built into the procedures whereby the governors of aided schools make significant proposals for their future. I accept the spirit of amendment No. 825 and will bring forward a Government amendment to the same effect … One of the reasons for accepting the spirit of amendment No. 825 is to allow the governors to think again before the die is cast. I am sure that the governors will do everything possible to attend at least one of the meetings at which such important decisions are being made."—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee J,</i> Thursday 28 January 1988; c. 1029–33.]</p></blockquote>
Given the Secretary of State's view in 1988, if the Government insist on not allowing a second ballot, which would enable governors to reflect fully on the importance of their decisions about grant-maintained status for schools, it is important that the Bill makes provision for such reflection in some other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0493">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>703</span>
The Department for Education, in its booklet "How to Become a Grant-Maintained School", describes this as "such a critical issue". So, obviously, all sides agree that the decision to ballot on grant-maintained status is extremely important. Given that the Government will not allow a second ballot, it is important that governors have 21 days' notice that such an item will be on the agenda. We think that 21 days is a reasonable time in which to obtain further information about the implications of such a ballot and, if necessary, to allow them to re-arrange their commitments so as to be present at such an important meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Education Reform Act, a previous Secretary of State allowed a second meeting for the decision to be examined, so that governors could attend one or other meeting. If the Government insist on one ballot only, our amendment proposing 21 days' notice is a reasonable addition to the Bill. I hope that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I add my voice to those of my colleagues who have welcomed you back at the beginning of 1993, Mr. Martin? Let us hope that it is a happier year than the last.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the Opposition's amendments were intended to change the nature of the Bill. We have made it clear that we do not like it. Nevertheless, our amendments are intended to be helpful and to reduce the chaos and confusion to which we referred often in our previous sittings and which will be the result of some of the Government's ill-thought out procedures. Amendment No. 101 is also meant to be helpful. I am sure that the Minister will agree that it is not in the Government's interest to have parents and governors disillusioned and dissatisfied because schools have not gone through the proper procedure for such a fundamental and deep-seated change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require that 21 days' notice be given for a governors' meeting before an opt-out ballot among parents is considered. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend noted, that is especially important as, if the second resolution is to be dropped, governors must have ample notice of the intention to hold an opt-out ballot. The removal of the second resolution lifts the obligation to consult local education authorities. That is not in anyone's interest. It is important that there is a proper, fundamental and searching debate and that governors are well informed before they take any irrevocable decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedure must define the process of consultation properly. If the 10 per cent. trigger point has been passed and a school is under a local education authority that has reached phase 2—where responsibility for strategic planning in an area is shared between the LEA and the funding agency—it may be appropriate for the governing body of that school to consult the funding agency as well as the LEA. That would ensure that governors are fully informed about the details and facts upon which parents are to be asked to vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience of governing bodies is that the average governors are not well informed and that they will need to seek information through consultation with other governors and with the community about what grant-maintained status means. Governors may need to rearrange their private commitments to ensure that they can be present at the governing body meeting at which the proposal is discussed. Therefore, it is not unreasonable, as

I hope that the Minister will agree, to ask that governors be given a minimum of 21 days' notice of such a meeting. That would enable them to go into the decision-making meeting fully informed. It would allow them to rearrange any previous commitments and mean that they could make a proper decision about a matter that many people find very difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend has said, the booklet published by the Department for Education, "How to Become a Grant-Maintained School", describes this as a critical issue. Opposition Members agree with that. When discussing grant-maintained status, the governors of Bassingbourn village college in Cambridgeshire regarded it to be of such fundamental importance that it required two meetings of the governing body. They considered that to be the minimum amount of time needed for governors to understand the issues before putting them before parents at governor-led meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, there are many articulate and well-informed parents. It is even more important that the governing body is well informed before going into governor-led parent meetings before a ballot. I would not want to face the parents in my constituency if I was not well informed about the issues on which I was consulting them and neither would most governors. Therefore, it is most important that governors do not feel that they are being bounced into a difficult position without adequate time for preparation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appropriate to raise in this debate the notice of the ballot and how important it is that it is notified in writing at the same time to the local education authority, to parents and, if appropriate, to the funding authority too. If the Government reject the amendment, I would ask what they are afraid of. What is it about grant-maintained status that makes the Government feel that they must push through ballots with the minimum of information and time properly to discuss the issues? It is important that such fundamental decisions are taken properly, after due consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, shall be brief. I begin by adding my voice to those wishing the Committee and you, Mr. Martin, the compliments of the season.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sad that the Opposition felt it necessary to table the amendment. I was a member of a governing body of a school which, despite being in Lambeth, was well run. We knew the dates of governors' meetings and had the relevant papers well in advance, certainly three weeks before a meeting. Grant-maintained status has been of such importance within education for so long that most governing bodies, even if they have not formally discussed the issue, have certainly had many informal discussions. Only rarely would a chairman—dare I say it, not the most sensible chairman—put such an important subject on an agenda without first consulting the other governors, formally or informally and ensuring that they were fully briefed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A complaint voiced in my constituency and reiterated many times in the Committee is that school governors now are weighted down with paper, much of it on grant-maintained status and related issues. Most schools have responsible governors—some of us may have questions about that subject later—who are already aware of the issues and of the legislative requirements relating to grant-maintained status. They would therefore feel
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>705</span>
comfortable with the well-run school's system in which an item on grant-maintained status will appear on the agenda, without the need for legislation to specify that 21 days' notice should be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worrying that Opposition Members believe that some schools are not being run well enough by their clerks and governors and therefore propose that 21 days' notice is given. We should perhaps know more about such schools and give them an easier freedom to become grant maintained. The amendment is, at least, unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree with me that the amendment would make no difference to the best-run governing bodies?

	<div class='membercontribution'>: That backs up my point that the subject is of such importance and interest that it has been discussed in all governing bodies, formally or informally, for many years.

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, Mr. Martin, join in wishing you a happy new year? Alas, it will not be so for many pupils in this country, especially in Wakefield, judging by what we read about in the standard spending assessments, which suggests that it costs much less to educate a child there than in Manchester.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come directly to the matter of the competence of governors and the way in which opt-out ballots are being introduced. I share fully the anxieties of the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Mrs. Lait) about the difficulty in finding sufficient able governors to run our schools properly. All too often, too many schools across a wide range are run on bias and prejudice. Therefore, it is right that we examine individual cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me is instances of members of governing bodies wishing their schools to opt out and being prepared to do anything to shove through their plans, including taking part in cover-ups with others. I shall give one example of which the Minister is aware because my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney) wrote to the Secretary of State about the status of the Hanson school in Bradford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was a difficult case. Improprieties in the ballot were alleged—some would say proven, but I shall not comment. However, I find it odd that the Secretary of State eventually wrote back to my hon. Friend, saying that he had consulted the governors and the head—the very people who had recommended grant-maintained status and a ballot in such haste—and that they had assured him that no irregularity had occurred. If that is not odd, I do not know what is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take the Committee through the details of the way in which the Hanson upper school decided to go for its ballot, and the Minister may like to confirm them. At a meeting on 8 June last year, the governors were led by the chair to believe that parents would receive information from both sides—the type of system that the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye suggested would operate under usual and reasonable procedures. Not unreasonably, governors
	<span class='label label-info column'>706</span>
—both those initially for and those initially against—sat back and waited for this balanced information from both sides to go out. It never arrived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A meeting was held on 13 July, at which the head teacher who, surely, had a pecuniary interest in what happened—a considerable one given the salaries being paid to some heads of grant-maintained schools—voted. That may be specifically allowed, but I find it rather odd. Although my remarks here are not strictly part of the amendment, they relate to the spirit of it and I think that the Minister could clear up this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further meeting took place on 24 August 1992. That is an odd time to hold a governors' meeting. I have been a school governor for many years, but I cannot recall a governor's meeting, even in a time of emergency, that was held at the height of the holidays. To hold a meeting at such a time reveals some governors' intentions. Only two thirds of governors were able to attend the meeting. That is reasonable for a meeting that was called suddenly on 24 August. Many people, especially parents of school children, are likely to be on holiday at that time. Nevertheless the meeting took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even then, those governors who supported grant-maintained status were timid and fearful. Therefore, a small sub-committee was created. It was given executive powers and its purpose was to prepare for grant-maintained status. The minutes of the meeting stated openly that only those governors who were in favour of grant-maintained status could serve on the subcommittees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term of office for the four governors appointed to the sub-committee ended on 31 August—before the next governors' meeting. That appears very odd to any reasonable person who considers the matter objectively. It would be suspicious and wrong even if a sub-committee had been convened of those who did not support grant-maintained status. It is contrary to the spirit of the Bill, which, we are constantly told, will give parents more power and information. The set up that I have described shows governors being more secretive than they were previously. That is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the decision made at the governors' meeting was to exclude some very committed governors, who had a history of dedication to the school. There are other governors, from all political parties, who attend a meeting only once a year to ensure that their names are retained on the list of governors. I have no truck with such people, whatever their political persuasion. However, the governors excluded by the meeting on 24 August were dedicated and had worked for the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 1 September, parents received letters, which told them to check the electoral roll by 8 September. That gave parents seven days, not the 14 days that are required by law. The actions of the governors flouted the law and limited parental choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
School resources and administration—the school budget—were used to produce, print and post to parents 16 separate items, all of which promoted grant-maintained status. That is natural, because the head and some governors supported GMS. However, the other side had no opportunity to put its case. Although children had taken home material to encourage parents to vote for GMS, the chair of governors refused to allow them to take home literature that presented an alternative view. The literature being sent out was not wild: it had been produced by the authority's education officers, and was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0495">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>707</span>
therefore partial, but those officers are not wild men and women. They are reasonable people who put a reasonable case in a rational manner. However, the executive body of governors refused to allow it to go out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The annual general meeting took place on 7 September. The four governors were involved in approving two more nominations for first-time governorships. Once again, the board was packed, even though the four governors' terms of office ended on 31 August. A meeting at the school was organised for parents by the head and the chairman of the governors—and so it goes on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need say no more on this matter, as it is already clear that there should be restraints when governors can flout fairness and democracy in that way. It is not a question of the merits or otherwise of grant-maintained status. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) said, there is no problem with good governing bodies as good practice will prevail. However, to prevent the divisions that occur in other governing bodies over ballots, clear rules and procedures must be laid down to ensure fairness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment carefully. It argues neither for nor against GMS, but when a school decides on one course of action—whether it be to stay with the local authority or to choose GMS—that decision should be made with full knowledge and in accordance with due and proper procedure. It should not cause the bitterness and rancour evident in Bradford, about which I heard during the Christmas holiday. That bitterness does pupils no good. It divides the staff, which compounds the difficulty. Frankness and openness will allow schools to go forward and will preserve a sense of unity between the factions, no matter how disappointed the losing faction may be. That unity means that the central task for which schools are set up—the education of pupils—can be continued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has listened to much unnecessary repetition. One element of the reasoning of my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye deserves to be highlighted, while the contribution from the hon. Member for Cambridge was somewhat unrealistic, and that from the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) descended into paranoia when he spoke of members of school governing bodies seeking to shove through grant-maintained status. That attitude betrayed a complete lack of understanding of the process through which grant-maintained status is adopted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment, when I have developed that point. The process of seeking grant-maintained status follows an open and democratic system in which governors and parents take part. Opposition Members laugh, as they have done so often in the past, at the prospect of parents holding ballots and expressing their views. Despite everything that they have
	<span class='label label-info column'>708</span>
said about ballots and their attempts to make unnecessary amendments to the balloting procedure the fact remains that there are ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot imagine that any school governing body will set out on the profound course of seeking grant-maintained status in the way in which hon. Members have described without that matter being properly put before a meeting of the governing body and without adequate consideration being given to it beforehand. Would any governing body reasonably do that without seeking the parents' consent through a ballot? I do not believe so.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is generalising far too much based on that particular example and is not drawing the lessons which are necessary for considering the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Hemsworth on the need to have sufficient, able governors on school governing bodies. I hope that he will join with me in welcoming the fact that in schools all over the country there has been a great outburst of parental interest in running those schools on grant-maintained status. That has been reflected in my constituency in each of the five major secondary schools that have opted for that status. There has been a massive increase in parental interest and more parents are seeking to become governors than ever before. I hope that hon. Members will join with me in welcoming that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to adjust my mind-set—as our American friends say—because I must reply to something approaching a real debate, which is quite a joy. I have had the pleasure of listening to the welcome contributions of my hon. Friends the Members for Hastings and Rye and for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison). I hope that we shall have similar succinct, punchy and relevant contributions in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start my brief reply by making a modest announcement because I think that it will help to put the matter in context. It relates to the existing arrangements which, as hon. Members know, are set out in the school governing regulations. They provide for the clerk to give a school's governing body seven days notice of the agenda. A provision in the regulations allows for less time if the chairman decides that some matters require urgent consideration. As the regulations stand, there is no requirement for all items to feature as specific items on the agenda. On that basis, the discussion of grant-maintained status for the school could be initiated under any other business. I should like the Committee to be aware that the Secretary of State intends to amend those regulations to ensure that the governing body includes consideration of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>709</span>
grant-maintained status as a named item on the agenda and gives seven days notice of that agenda and the meeting at which that item will be discussed. That moves us forward because it eliminates some of the worries expressed by hon. Members today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the amendment will force school governing bodies to consider the opt-out procedure? They will not have the democratic right to decide for themselves: is that the intention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not confirm that. Grant-maintained status will have to be considered as a named agenda item; it cannot be dealt with under "any other business". That will ensure that members of the governing body know as and when grant-maintained status is to be considered because it will not be brought up suddenly under "any other business". That deals with the point made by Opposition Members about the element of surprise or hijacking that they allege may occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should bear in mind that the deliberations and resolutions of governing bodies are not the definitive actions that decide the future of a school. The governing body decides whether there should be a ballot of parents: that ballot will always be the determining factor. Although the deliberations and resolutions of the governors are important, they are not final, decisive or definitive; they are simply a precursor to a possible parental ballot. If a sufficient number of parents wish, they can also initiate the ballot procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cambridge told us of a school that had taken two meetings or more to deliberate on those matters. Nothing prevents any board of governors deliberating on this matter, or any other, at as many meetings as they choose. We should not assume that a debate means a vote on a resolution. As in this Committee, a debate could take place over two sittings. Therefore, it is possible for a board of governors to discuss a matter on the agenda at one meeting and then discuss it further at another meeting before a vote on the resolution is taken. That is entirely a matter for them. The hon. Lady implied that that could not be done under the existing provisions, but that is not so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hemsworth made an important point. He took us through a specific case in great detail. I shall not comment on that case but I shall pick up his point about whether it is correct or proper for a head teacher who is a governor to participate in a vote of the governing body on grant-maintained status. I believe that that is perfectly proper. If the resolution before the governing body were on head teacher's pay, for example, it would probably not be proper for the head teacher to participate in the vote, and I doubt that he or she would. But if the vote were on whether a ballot should be held on grant-maintained status, no one could reasonably say that the head teacher had a vested interest or a direct pecuniary interest, other than the fact that most head teachers these days probably take the view that grant-maintained status for their schools is a jolly good idea—increasing numbers of them believe that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman reflects on the matter he will probably agree with me that there is no impropriety in a head teacher participating in the deliberations of the governing body on a matter such as grant-maintained
	<span class='label label-info column'>710</span>
status. There is no guarantee that the head teacher will gain financially: it is possible that he or she will lose by it. Having achieved grant-maintained status, the school might decide that the head teacher's salary was too generous and might want to review it. The hon. Gentleman is off beam and is being a little mischievous in implying that it is wrong for head teachers to participate in the discussions of the governing body and to vote on whether parents should be balloted to decide whether the school should become grant maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Hastings and Rye and for Hertsmere made the points as well as, or better, than I can. As I explained, we shall, in a modest way, improve the existing arrangements for school governing bodies, which are perfectly acceptable and workable, if only because we now have five more years experience than when my right hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley stood before a similar Committee in his role as pathfinder. He is a great pathfinder, as my hon. Friends know. We are in a different position now because we know so much more about what grant-maintained schools mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We hear noises off from Opposition Members about how we have failed but if grant-maintained schools are such a failure, why are Opposition Members so wound up about them? That is the great paradox of this Committee, which I am sure the hon. Gentleman is about to resolve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. It is precisely because they are a failure that we oppose them. If they were a great success we would support the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt that. The Labour party's record for supporting success is limited but its track record for supporting failures is almost perfect, as a succession of elections has demonstrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our deliberations on this matter in Committee have been characterised by Opposition Members demonstrating in this and other amendments that they fear what grant-maintained status means. Of course they do, because it means independence, local accountability and an improvement in the managerial and educational quality of schools. If that is what Opposition Members fear, I begin to understand them, but the way to tackle the issue is not to table amendments such as those before us. The modest improvements to the regulations proposed by the Secretary of State will plug a small but important loophole. The 21 days' notice proposed in the amendment is neither necessary nor desirable. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the amendment of the current regulations announced by the Under-Secretary on behalf of the Secretary of State. It will at least require that a ballot for grant-maintained status will be considered only when such an item is declared separately on an agenda which is subject to seven days' notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary put the amendment in context concisely by describing it as "modest". The Committee should remember that it was proposed in the context of a procedure that allows for two governors' meetings to consider and vote under a motion relating specifically to grant-maintained status. If there were still to be two meetings, seven days' notice of a specific item on the agenda would be an improvement. However, because the Bill might include a proposal for only one meeting at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>711</span>
which a ballot is discussed, perhaps the Minister will consider including a further proposal that that meeting should take place during term time. Without that proviso the system could be subject to further abuse; for example if a meeting were held when some governors were away on holidays they might have to alter their plans, which could mean substantial financial loss. I will say nothing else about today's announcement, save that it is a small and modest improvement, and better than not having the item listed on the agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment No. 101 must be considered in the context of the governors having only one opportunity to vote on a proposal to ballot governors on whether a school should become grant-maintained. I contend that, under the present system, even if the first meeting were held to discuss that item when it was not on the agenda and a decision made to ballot parents, at least the second meeting would allow governors who were not at the first, or did not have sufficient time for discussion, an opportunity to consider what the right hon. Member for Mole Valley, when Secretary of State, conceded in February 1988 was an important decision which justified mature consideration and reflection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment is hardly a revolutionary step forward or a great break with the status quo. I see it as a sensible proposal that would give the governors either freedom to re-arrange their commitments to ensure their attendance at a specific meeting or the opportunity to gather information about what is involved so that a full discussion may take place. Despite the Minister's remarks, the Secretary of State's proposal to amend the regulations will not be satisfactory because there will be only one meeting of a governing body at which the decision on grant-maintained status can be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge that well-run governing bodies have nothing to fear from the amendment but that safeguards are needed to ensure that the three-week timetable can be included to ensure that good practice is undertaken by all governing bodies? It would then be unnecessary to rely upon good practice being the yardstick.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I do not know whether the Department for Education could conduct a survey among schools that have balloted to become grant-maintained, but it would be interesting to discover how many held their initial discussions under "any other business".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hastings and Rye spoke of the well-conducted meetings of governors about which she knew. If that practice pertained throughout the country, our amendment would be unnecessary, but we know that it is not so. When the need for a second resolution is removed, as the Bill intends, the 21 days' notice will be important as it will allow governors to collect their thoughts, obtain information and ensure that they are present at the meeting at which the matter will be discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, in the spirit of his announcement of the amendment to the current regulations, the Minister will be prepared to consider further the proposal that three weeks' notice be given, rather than one week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take this opportunity to wish you, Mr. Martin, a happy new year. I extend the same greetings to all members of the Committee. I also welcome the new Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education to the Committee. I hope that he will begin his career by agreeing to the amendments that I have tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments have two key purposes. First, they would ensure that there is a minimum period between the initiation and the conclusion of the parental opt-out ballot process. Secondly, they would ensure that the balloting and associated procedures take place, as far as possible, at times when pupils are in school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Government share those aims. They are already enshrined in a Government document. The Government booklet entitled "How to Become a Grant-Maintained School" advises governors that they will
	<br><blockquote><p>"have to agree with the ERS"—q</p></blockquote>
the Electoral Reform Society of Great Britain and Ireland—
	<br><blockquote><p>"a closing date for the ballot which, whilst being consistent with the statutory timetable, allows adequate preparation time and, if at all possible, falls during term time."</p></blockquote>
That document clearly supports the two key principles advanced in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee accepts that the transformation to grant-maintained status is critical for a school. It is important that parents make such a decision in a measured manner. Time is vital for adequate consultation and discussion, and for parents to be fully briefed by a range of people. The idea of consultation that has infected the Government should not be allowed to affect schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>713</span>
Many members of the Committee have mentioned the inadequacy of the consultation on the White Paper that preceded the Bill. Before the recess, the comments section of the 
	<i>Times Educational Supplement</i> stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Bill, which will have a profound impact on the future of the education service, was preceded by wholly inadequate public discussion … The consultation process indeed was akin to a sham."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that no one wishes a similar criticism to be made of the balloting procedure, and the consultation and discussion that it includes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that when the right hon. Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. MacGregor) was Secretary of State, he emphasised the need for consultation and the view, which the amendments also convey, that consultation should not take place during school holidays. Therefore, the Government, accept the principles of the amendments. They would not wreck the ballot procedure, or delay the maximum period for a ballot stipulated in the Bill. They would ensure a minimum, practical period of time, which would not be during school holidays, before a ballot could take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minimum practical time takes account of information that we already accept: there should be 14 days for checking and amending the electoral roll of parents. Further time is needed to communicate with the Electoral Reform Society and for the Electoral Reform Society to prepare and despatch the necessary documents. The period set out in the amendment allows time for that and for 21 days for consultation and deliberation before the ballot takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that Conservative Members will agree that the amendments propose the bare minimum period of time that is necessary before the ballot closes. The amendments are based on principles that the Government accept; they would not wreck the Bill. I am not being extreme in trying to extend the balloting process. I hope that the Minister will announce that he is willing to accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are modest and I hope that the Minister will respond positively to them. The Committee will be aware that the Government think that the seeking of grant-maintained status is a critical issue facing a school. Therefore, one would have thought that such a decision should not be rushed, but should involve proper discussion and debate. When such a critical issue faces parents whose children attend a particular school, proper procedures should be laid down to require the decision to go through the proper procedure and not be rushed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to address particularly amendments Nos. 218 and 219, which require decisions to be taken not during school holidays but during term time. They are sensible proposals and would ensure that all parents could take a positive part in an important decision about the future of a particular school. If a ballot is held at a time other than term time, many parents will feel that they have been denied a proper opportunity to take part in debates about the school's future. Holidays are taken during the school holidays and it is difficult to get groups of parents together to discuss the merits and disadvantages of grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are keen to embark on their consultation during the school holidays—many of us
	<span class='label label-info column'>714</span>
know the reasons for that. Recently, it is interesting to note that the important document on the future funding arrangements for grant-maintained schools slipped out on the Friday before Christmas. All schools were on holiday and Parliament was in recess. Studying the contents of the document one can understand why the Government were not keen to have maximum publicity because they could not give any guarantees about the future—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that the hon. Gentleman has returned from the recess in such a unforgiving mood. He may recall that it was the hon. Gentleman himself who pressed me on when the document would be released.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several times in the Committee I told him that I would endeavour to get the document out before Christmas. For him to turn up after Christmas and say, in a rather uncharitable way, that it is unsatisfactory is less than fair. I hope that he reflects on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always seek to be fair to the Minister—my colleagues would say that that is one of my failings. I was making a genuine point. That important consultation document was released before Christmas—that was the assurance that the Minister gave the Committee—but we presumed that it would be at a time when people would be able to digest the information in it. I understand that the Minister was not keen to get maximum publicity for its content, but to slip it out on the afternoon of the last Friday before Christmas—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a working day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a working day for all of us, but it is interesting to note the difference between the media management of that particular item compared with other events in exactly the same week. It could have been left until a Monday morning if the Government had been particularly keen for the details of the consultation document to be widely known. They did not want it to be widely known, which is why it was released in that way. It is a good illustration of the way in which the Government are unhappy about important educational matters being discussed while schools are in session. They would rather leave them until the school holidays; the White Paper is a good example of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has said that it is undesirable for important decisions to be taken during school holidays. Practical problems will arise: for example, parents have the right to check the parental register to ensure that they are entitled to vote in the ballot, but access to the register may be difficult if the school is closed for the school holiday. How will parents be able to check whether they have the right to take part in that ballot? We do not want to put obstacles in the way of parents participating in such an important decision. The amendments are clear and positive; they would ensure that parents have those rights by guaranteeing that they are able to exercise them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If fewer than 50 per cent. of parents participate in the first ballot, the Bill requires a second ballot. The way to ensure that 50 per cent. is not achieved on the second ballot is for it to be held during a holiday. Amendment No. 219 would provide that if a second ballot were required because of the low turnout in the first ballot, it would have to take place during term time. That is a simple way of ensuring a higher turnout on the second ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are keen to proclaim the high turnout in parental ballots. In the early days there was a high turnout of parents, but recently there has been a marked
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>715</span>
decline. The danger is that without the requirement for a second ballot to take place during term, the 50 per cent. threshold will not be reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are sensible and modest and I hope that the Minister will respond to them positively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister went some way to meeting our objections on the previous amendment—it is clear that he is in a constructive, reasonable mood. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) is clearly and eminently rational and helpful. The Minister could end the debate by interrupting me to say that he accepts the principle and will put it into practice in a particular way later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anything to do with a school should not take place during a vacation. I deliberately use the word "vacation" and not "holiday" because many teachers take courses, at their own expense, especially in the long summer break, to equip themselves better to teach the children whose future is in their hands. Teachers have an important part to play in ballots. Their working conditions will be affected by the result and they will make a success or otherwise of the outcome of those ballots. They must be closely involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) said, parents need to be able to stand back and consider the matter clearly, not suddenly to have a ballot thrust upon them. Parents should be able to take a calm, cool, clear decision, and not be overly rushed. I would not want the period of electioneering before a ballot to be too protracted because that could create difficulties. However, I plead with the Minister to take my remarks into account, because they would greatly improve the procedures for a ballot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I add my best wishes to the Committee for the new year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, I attended the north of England conference to listen to the "Any Questions" broadcast. The Secretary of State for Education should have been on the platform but unfortunately he could not even attend the conference, let alone subject himself to the scrutiny of those involved in education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He was on holiday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was he on holiday, or visiting schools? His replacement was to have been the right hon. Member for Brent, North (Sir R. Boyson) but he, too, was unable to attend. Eventually a spokesman from the Association of County Councils was found to represent the Conservative view. My hon. Friend the Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) presented the Labour view and the hon. Member for Bath the view of the Liberal Democrats. However, it was difficult to disagree with the views of the Conservative spokesman who distanced himself from the Government line. A consensus is emerging about how education should proceed in the 1990s. The Government appear to be the only people out of step with it. It was difficult for the organisers of the north of England conference to find anyone to support the Government's line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already debated whether we agree with grant-maintained status and Labour Members have made it abundantly clear that we believe it is divisive. The amendments, however, relate not to that debate but to the fundamentals of democracy. That is why I believe that the Minister will accept the amendment: it would strengthen the democratic procedures that are wrapped around the ballots to opt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>716</span>
Democracy demands choice, as the Committee will agree, and that choice should be well-informed. The amendments would ensure that the ballot mechanisms contain an adequate consultation period to ensure that when parents ballot on whether a school should opt out, they are well-informed. It would strengthen the procedure and benefit the Government if they could say, "this period is built into the Bill so that parents have the opportunity fully to understand the issues before them." I hope that the Government will accept the amendment in that spirit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Democracy also demands participation. The amendment would ensure the maximum possible participation because it does two things: first, it extends the 14-day period after school governing bodies have passed a resolution to proceed to a ballot, so that parents can ensure that their names are on the list of those entitled to participate in the ballot. That strengthens the democratic process because it ensures that people can participate, which is essential if the Bill is to make any sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendment would ensure that ballots cannot be held during a vacation. That, too, strengthens democracy because a ballot held during term time would ensure the maximum participation of parents. It would also ensure full consultation so that parents would know the pros and cons of the decisions that they must take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The democratic process must also be strengthened for another reason. If the Government go ahead with their intention to remove the second ballot—and the Minister has not given any indication of a change of heart—the result could be that fewer than 50 per cent. of the parents in a school could determine whether that school opts out of local education authority control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative Government define democracy in a number of different ways. For example, in industrial relations, they demand a high turnout, with two thirds voting for industrial action, before a ballot can be deemed democratic. However, a minority of parents will be allowed to force their school to opt for grant-maintained status. That is why we must ensure that the ballots are absolutely democratic and fair. A favourite quote of mine was made in 1944 by Reinhold Niebuhr, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible, but man's inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary."</p></blockquote>
The amendments would remove the Bill's potential for injustice. They would allow the people involved to be fully informed by extending the consultation period. They would ensure also that ballots would be held in term time, thus building into the Bill participation, which is one of the essential elements of democracy. I am sure that the Minister, being a fair-minded gentleman, will accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The one thing that I shall not do, this morning or at any other time, is to take lectures from Opposition Members about democracy.

To return to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Bath: I shall use another Americanism—I have been reading American presidential biographies and am in that frame of mind. The old favourite saying is
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it ain't broke, don't fix it."</p></blockquote>
The giveaway came when the hon. Member for Bath said—he was protesting a little too much—that he did not intend that the amendments should wreck the ballot mechanism. I thought then, "Ah, so these amendments are not intended to wreck the procedure. Well, that's a relief." The Government must consider whether the amendments intend genuinely to enhance the possibility of grant-maintained status, when freely agreed by parental ballot, and whether they will improve the operation of grant-maintained schools. Opposition Members have openly stated that they oppose grant-maintained status root and branch. Therefore, I am entitled to consider whether Opposition amendments are designed to improve the quality of decision making, local democracy and grant-maintained schools; or whether they intend to delay, undermine or derail the whole process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. That is perfectly acceptable. The current arrangements have proved satisfactory.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No matter what arrangements we make, it is inevitable that anomalies will exist.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I give way, I refer to the excellent document "How To Become A Grant-maintained School". It provides adequate guidance, and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there will … be a certain amount of work for you to do as governors: You will have to agree with the ERS a closing date for the ballot which, whilst being consistent with the statutory timetable, allows adequate preparation time and, if at all possible, falls during term time."</p></blockquote>
That is fine. "If at all possible" seems eminently sensible. Governing bodies must base their judgment and decisions on their circumstances and on what is best for their school and for the parents. We do not provide over-prescriptive timetables or determine from the centre what should happen. We are trying to devolve decision making and ensure community involvement. Opposition Members, especially Liberal Democrats, argue for those principles. Yet the hon. Member for Bath attempts to be prescriptive, while the Government do his job and promote devolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister described as an anomaly the entitlement of parents whose children have left a school to vote in the ballot about grant-maintained status.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One must strike a balance. We should consider whether parents whose children have been at a school for some time and who know it well are in a better position to make judgments than parents whose children have just arrived at it and who do not know it at all. To nail this matter down as precisely as Opposition Members are purporting to do could be damaging. It will almost certainly be destructive and have a negative influence, and we are not prepared to accept that. There is ample evidence to show that the existing arrangements—altered in the way in which we have proposed—are adequate and have on the whole worked rather well. I am reluctant to accept amendments that seek to make substantial changes to the arrangements that have operated broadly satisfactorily for some years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That brings me neatly to another point that we have perhaps forgotten during the recess. We should not include in the Bill the level of detail that Opposition Members want for a very good and practical reason: once it is on the statute it is difficult to change it. If changing circumstances require reasonable changes to be made, we should have an opportunity to do that. It is better to issue sensible guidelines, which can be updated and changed from time to time, backed by a broad framework of principle in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The idea that governors can run riot and conduct ballots in any way that they please and get away with it is misconceived. The governors may face the penalty of having the ballot made void and having to go through the whole process again. It is wrong to suggest that they can casually ignore the guidance because that would be taken into consideration if the Secretary of State had to examine the way in which the ballot was conducted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, they are not the same. We spent much time considering that guidance, which has a specific status. The guidance, set out in "How to Become A Grant-Maintained School", is not of the same type; it is not statutory. There is no legal framework that would make this publication into statutory regulations. Most importantly, the way in which my Department operates, as Opposition Members know, is by issuing circulars in some circumstances and guidance in others. These are designed to be helpful, to guide not only recipients but the Secretary of State of the day, who will have regard to such guidance when considering complaints or appeals, which is as it should be.

The great beauty of the guidance notes is that, because they are not set in concrete for the time being by not being on the statute book, they are flexible and able to be changed and updated as circumstances change and our experience grows. That seems a satisfactory way to proceed. We resist the temptation to put in the Bill ever
	<span class='label label-info column'>720</span>
more detail about what people would like, including provision to deal with problems which may or may not exist, or be significant. Generally, I try to resist including such provisions.

I was pleased to hear the hon. Member for Wallsend describe the amendments as sensible and modest and to hear the hon. Member for Hemsworth say that they were eminently rational and helpful. That was what I intended. I said in my intervention that they would not wreck the ballot procedure in the Bill; they were intended to be helpful, reasonable, rational and realistic. They would have strengthened the democratic process on which the Minister is so keen. The hon. Gentleman has accepted this, in line with the principles of the guidance document, "How to Become A Grant-Maintained School".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised that in response to interventions the Minister gave the impression that he was completely happy with ballot procedures taking place during the school period, although this conflicts directly with this guidance. This contradiction cannot possibly help people who subsequently wish to protest about the balloting procedure because they will look at the record of the debate and know that at least one Government Front-Bench spokesman on education has no objection to ballots taking place during the summer holiday with all the problems that that would bring.

The hon. Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) mentioned the Secretary of State's absence from the north of England education conference.

Does he agree that it is a great pity that Conservative Members now accept that Conservative county councillors do not agree with their party's policies?

My amendments would improve the democratic process, but the Minister has made it clear that he will not accept them. He said that he does not wish so much detail to be included in the Bill, yet the Bill is the longest, most complex education Bill ever to come before the House of Commons. The hon. Gentleman said that we should not give individual governing bodies freedom to decide how to conduct the ballot, yet subsection 1(a) states specifically that the ballot shall take place
	<br><blockquote><p>"within … three months beginning with the date of the resolution".</p></blockquote>
My amendment would only ensure that the ballot does not begin before consultation but would still be held within the specified maximum period. It is a great pity that the Minister is unwilling to accept the amendment. All Opposition Members will be sadly disappointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill upholds the notion that, at one time, a specific group of parents, can determine the future of education provision in an area. The Minister has no desire for other members of the community, who are not parents of pupils at the time of the ballot, to be involved in that decision, or for the parents of future pupils at that school to be involved. Therefore, it is of no surprise to me that he made his earlier comments. I assure him that I and many many others involved in education will study his response with great care. I suspect that he will receive much publicity. It is a great pity that he has not accepted the amendment, which I now wish to put to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that it will please you, Mr. Martin, to know that I shall be extremely brief. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>722</span>
amendments—as I believed that the others would be—are likely to be accepted by the Government. I hope that on this occasion I am not wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 3 makes it absolutely clear that after a yes ballot has taken place and proposals to establish a grant-maintained school have been put before the Secretary of State, it is necessary to make that information widely known by it being
	<br><blockquote><p>"posted at or near the main entrance to the school"</p></blockquote>
and by it being
	<br><blockquote><p>"posted in at least one conspicuous place within the area served by the school"</p></blockquote>
and by making copies available at the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have clearly accepted that the publication of proposals for GM status is an important issue and should be made widely known and as quickly as possible, but I believe that there is an omission in the Bill. We have all accepted that the change to GM status and the parental ballot that leads to such a change are critical. It is vital that notification of a ballot on such an important issue should be known as quickly and as widely as possible. The amendments would ensure that once the governing body has decided to go to a ballot, within two days it should make that information widely known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are not wrecking or delaying amendments. The Minister continues to claim that he is in favour of the democratic process. When local government and national elections take place, there is widespread distribution of information. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will accept the principle enshrined in the amendments that information about the ballot should be made widely available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments ensure that the trustees of a school give quick notification to their LEA about the intention to hold a ballot. Through the process, the amendments would also ensure that the intention to hold a ballot for grant-maintained status would be as widely known as possible in the communities that the school serves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Members of Parliament we are all well aware of the fact that it is extremely difficult to ensure that the public knows about what goes on in the community at the official level. We need only think of a planning application, when people say, "Oh, but we did not know about that until the report of the meeting of the planning committee was in the local newspaper. There was a notice up on the telegraph pole at the gate of the field concerned, where they were planning to build an abattoir next to the local hospital, but, we did not bother to look at it because we did not realise that it was so important."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Bath said, there is acceptance by both sides of the Committee of the importance of balloting parents on grant-maintained status. It is extremely important that the amendments are accepted. They would not impede the ballot's timetable, and they would ensure that information about the timetable was widely available. That would allow time for parents who wish to be active in the ballot procedure to gather information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All too often, parents do not realise that a ballot is to take place until the eve of the ballot, or after the process has begun. There are many reasons for that. The amendments would provide another opportunity for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>723</span>
publicising the decision so that parents know what is happening. They would enable parents to be properly informed about the pros and cons of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some cases, governing bodies have not informed the LEA, or have delayed before contacting the LEA, about the intention to hold a ballot, or about the receipt of a petition from parents in favour of a ballot. A LEA that wishes to provide information about a decision is, therefore, left at a disadvantage in such circumstances. While we hope that governors are fair minded in their approach to the ballot and the provision of information to parents, one side of the argument can receive an advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept that the amendments would not hold up the ballot, that they have much to commend them, because they would ensure that parents and the wider community were aware of the proposal. They would also ensure fair dissemination of balanced information so that parents are properly informed about the decision that they are about to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a distinction between amendments Nos. 242 and 245, which would require notice, and amendments Nos. 207,208,215 and 225, which deal with publishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge the strength of amendments Nos. 242 and 245, which require written notice to be given within two working days to the LEA and the trustees, where appropriate, to ensure that all is as it should be. I can accept the thrust of the amendments. If they are withdrawn in the normal way now, I shall undertake to have them redrafted by Parliamentary Counsel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not recommend amendments Nos. 207, 208, 215 and 225. The requirement to publish is onerous. It implies wider participation than that of parents in the balloting process. We are, after all, talking about schools, governors and the balloting of parents. The amendments imply that the requirement to publish will result in dissemination of results to a wider audience. The wider audience of the community is involved when statutory proposals are made in respect of a school. At that point, there will be the opportunity for people outside the school to participate in the proposals and the associated procedures. It is right to make the distinction between the amendments that contain a requirement to give notice, which I support, and those that involve publication, which I reject for the reasons that I have given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. We welcome what the Minister has said about the two amendments that deal with giving notice. That is an important part of the process. People with a direct interest in what happens at a school must be able to know about, and take part in, a ballot. The Minister's comments on the wider issue outlined in the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Bath are for the hon. Gentleman to respond to. Personally, I believe that those amendments are helpful. The sooner the wider community knows that a school may ballot to become grant maintained, the sooner people are brought into the more general debate. As the Minister said, that would occur once the proposals to go for grant-maintained status were published. The amendments would not hold that process up. They would enable the community to be better informed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>724</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who clearly accepts that the two amendments referred to by the Minister should be withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not wish to abandon the remaining amendments. The Minister was not correct when he asserted that the wider community should be involved only after a proposal for grant-maintained status has been made and has been published for ultimate consideration by the Secretary of State. The wider community has a right to be involved in the ballot procedure. I do not agree with it, but I accept that the ballot will be undertaken by parents. Members of the wider community should have the opportunity to lobby the people who will be eligible to vote in the ballot. That would bring greater democracy to the process, and that is why I am anxious that the wider community should be informed that a ballot is to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious also that the parents who vote in the ballot should know as rapidly as possible that such a ballot is to take place. The Bill contains no mechanism requiring governors to publish the fact that they have agreed to hold such a ballot. It is ludicrous that parents will know that a ballot is to take place only when the ballot paper falls on their doormat. In all our other elections, advance notification of a ballot is sent to those involved. All reasonable people accept that. That is what the three amendments would ensure. I am sad that the Minister is not willing to accept them but I hope that Conservative Members who believe in democracy and in informing people of their democratic rights will support them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to say a few words about the principle behind clause 17.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen both sides of the Minister's character this morning. On occasions, he was extremely helpful and told us that he would take into account some of our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>725</span>
amendments, especially those in the first group and those taken with amendment No. 207. Unlike his hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye, the Minister accepted the principle that it would be wrong for a ballot on grant-maintained status to be considered under "any other business". He accepted that the governing body should not be bounced in that way. However, I suggest that his amendment, which proposed seven days' notice, is not adequate, not least because seven days' notice in the middle of August does not give governors much time to consider the matter properly. Nevertheless, the Minister accepted the principle behind our proposal and we are grateful for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are still alarmed at the Minister's outburst when we suggested that ballots should be held in term time. Even though he accepts the anomaly that the parents of about one fifth of pupils in a school—or of about one quarter of the pupils in a middle school of four years—could have no interest in that ballot, he is unwilling to do anything about that or to accept the reasonable amendments that we put forward at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried not just about the Minister's unreasonableness, but about the whole idea behind clause 17 that there should simply be one resolution from the governors to seek grant-maintained status, rather than the proper discussions and arrangements provided for in the Education Reform Act 1988. That attitude has probably arisen because Ministers are so disappointed with the interest in opting out and are now trying to push and bully schools into such action. The latest figures show that, up to yesterday, there have been only 655 ballots in favour—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should remind the hon. Gentleman that when the provisions were introduced originally, we were told that thousands of schools would have opted out before the previous general election. Only about a week ago the Secretary of State revised downwards his expectation of the number of schools that will become grant-maintained within the next year. The schools that have become grant-maintained have been located predominantly in Conservative-controlled authorities. We all remember the Secretary of State's statement when grant-maintained provisions were first introduced: that schools would opt out to escape from failed local authorities. He anticipated that those authorities would be Labour ones, but, in practice, they have proved, predominantly, to be Conservative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Conservative-controlled councils of Kent and Essex, 69 and 73 schools respectively have opted out. Those two Conservative-controlled authorities have more opted-out schools than all the Labour authorities put together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady accept also that part of the problem is the misinformation that Labour-controlled authorities have disseminated? The Department for Education has had to issue letters to education officers on that matter. As the relevant press releases make clear, four such letters went out on 7 December and three on 21 December 1992. Therefore, it is obvious that schools in Labour authorities have decided
	<span class='label label-info column'>726</span>
not to go for grant-maintained status because of the barrage of misinformation and black propaganda that Labour authorities have circulated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the hon. Gentleman feels it necessary to carry with him Department for Education press releases shows the sensitivity that exists on the matter. Let me repeat the figures: there have been 441 ballots in Conservative LEAs. In Conservative-controlled Kent and Conservative-controlled Essex more schools have opted out than in all Labour-controlled authorities put together. If opting out is a sign of dissatisfaction with LEAs, it is clear that the dissatisfaction exists within Conservative authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister were serious that opting out and ballots should be expressions of democracy and opportunities for local people to have a real say, he would not encourage clauses that make proper democratic discussion more difficult. What is wrong with the original proposals for governors to have two proper discussions and make two proper resolutions? Why is the Under-Secretary now so worried about governors that he does not want to allow them two proper opportunities for discussion? Perhaps it is because an insufficient number of governing bodies have come up with the right answer—from the Minister's point of view—and have not advocated opting out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It comes as a considerable surprise to have the opportunity to move this important amendment. Amendment No. 270 would insert in clause 19 the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or any person employed at such a school".</p></blockquote>
Without the inclusion of that phrase, there will be only limited information available regarding those persons eligible to vote in the opt-out ballot. As I said earlier, it is right and proper that anyone with an interest in the outcome of such a ballot has an opportunity to converse with and lobby those who are voting in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I firmly hold the view that school employees have a considerable interest in the outcome of an opt-out ballot. There will be significant changes to their activities if such a ballot takes place. The Minister has said on numerous occasions that the change to grant-maintained status confers considerable extra powers and responsibilities on a grant-maintained school, so much so that it is clear from all of the DFE's pronouncements that grant-maintained schools will continue to receive additional funds, over and above those of remaining LEA schools, to help them carry out their additional functions and responsibilities, even under the new proposals for the common funding formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are to be additional functions and responsibilities, who will carry them out? The answer is the employees. It seems reasonable that school employees should have an opportunity to discuss their concerns and fears about the proposals with those involved in a ballot about significant change in a school's status. They should have the opportunity to express the view—should they hold it—that there would be significant benefits to the school. I seek to make balanced comments and understand that some school employees may be of the opinion that a move to grant-maintained status may be beneficial to their school, although such views are held by a minority as far as we are aware. If we accept that school employees will be significantly affected by a change to grant-maintained status, I am sure that the Committee will wish to ensure that such persons have an opportunity to speak with those taking part in the ballot.

A previous amendment of mine sought to provide an opportunity for the information about a ballot to be made widely known. I suggested that not only people involved in the ballot, but the community had an interest. Sadly, the Minister said that that was not the case. He was of the opinion that members of the local community did not have any reason to be involved at that stage and, therefore, did not need to know that a ballot was to take place. I hope that the Minister will at least accept that school employees have a particular interest and that he will accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening to the arguments for the amendment with interest. The hon. Member for Bath has already stated the importance of employees being notified of a decision to hold a ballot. Has he given any thought to the European Community acquired rights directive, which school employees may wish to bring to the attention of parents and other employees? To do that, those employees could have a list of parents who are eligible to take part in the ballot. The acquired rights directive highlights important issues such as the employees' terms and conditions of employment. There many be changes to those terms and conditions after the change to grant-maintained status. If the hon. Gentleman cannot discuss that issue this morning, perhaps he can do so this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, which drew an important EC directive to our attention. He referred to the changing nature of employees' role in our education institutions and I am sure that he accepts that a change to grant-maintained status would alter the terms and conditions of employment of school staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
