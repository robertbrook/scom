	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Gapes (Ilford, South)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I must draw attention to the fact that the Bill was introduced to the House as a ten-minute Bill on 29 January 1997. Its intention was to make it a criminal offence to claim in writing or orally that the policy of genocide against the Jewish people committed by Nazi Germany did not occur. The Bill received it First Reading on 29 January, it was published on 24 February and had its Second Reading, without opposition, on 28 February.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I explained my reasons for introducing the Bill on 29 January when I made it clear that many other countries in Europe, including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France and Lithuania have already legislated against Holocaust denial and that such proposals are being considered by other countries. The difficulty is that our legislation is based on the Public Order Act 1986. Under that Act, material that is deemed to be offensive and which incites racial hatred can be prosecuted against, but such measures do not apply to Holocaust denial material—something that I shall say more about later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Critics of the Bill have said that it is not necessary to have a specific Bill on Holocaust denial. That criticism has been met by the fact that the Bill is proposing an amendment to the Public Order Act 1986, whereby it will come within the scope of that Act's provisions and be covered by the safeguards and penalties of that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been pleased by the wide interest and publicity that has been shown in the Bill. It has received extensive coverage on radio, television and in the press. I have had an interesting post bag. I have received letters of support from Holocaust survivors and their close relatives and I have also had my share of vicious, nasty, anti-Semitic hate mail. I am not Jewish, but it is interesting that most of the people who write such hate mail assume that one has to be Jewish to be concerned about the Holocaust and anti-Semitism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some critics of the Bill are well intentioned and have argued that it was necessary to introduce proposals that would amend the 1986 Act. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
argument has been met by the Bill. I refer, in particular, to the criticisms that were made last month by Mr. Anthony Lerman of the Institute for Jewish Policy Research and Geoffrey Bindman, who wrote an article about it in the 
	<i>Jewish Chronicle</i> last week—criticisms that, I believe, are met to some extent by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people wrote to me asking why the original, short version of the Bill referred only to the policy of genocide against the Jewish people. I believe that that criticism is answered by the drafting of clause 1, which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the policy of genocide against the Jewish people and other similar crimes against humanity committed by Nazi Germany".</p></blockquote>
We should not in any way minimise the evil crimes committed against the Jews, gipsies, homosexuals, Serbs or other opponents of Nazism in the areas occupied by the Nazis and their allies during the 1940s. It is estimated—it is difficult to be precise—that 11 million people died in the Holocaust at the hands of the Nazis and their allies. Six million of those were Jews, who were systematically murdered on the basis of an ideology and what came to be the search for a so-called final solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is appropriate that the Bill should come to Committee today, given that the media reported this morning that leaflets denying the Holocaust are being put into copies of Anne Frank's diary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gapes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I read the reports about people putting leaflets and stickers in books that are on sale in bookshops. That shows the lengths to which the small group of fanatical Nazis and neo-Nazis are prepared to go. Such people clearly have a particular frame of mind; they not only damage useful publications, but cause enormous offence to people who buy or look at the books.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to another matter that has arisen since the Bill was published. During Prime Minister's questions on 11 February, the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes) raised the general issue of Holocaust denial and mentioned the Bill. The Prime Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It might be right to introduce a specific offence…However, I am dubious about the practical effect of doing so…At present, that material is subject to prosecution under public order law".—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 February 1997; Vol. 290, c. 137.]</p></blockquote>
Following that statement, I wrote to the Prime Minister on 14 February. I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I was intrigued by your reference to holocaust denial material being 'subject to prosecution under public order law'. I am attaching a copy of a letter from the Attorney General to the Rt. Hon David Hunt MP dated 19 July 1996 in which he makes clear the view of the Crown Prosecution Service that although Holocaust Denial material is regarded as 'undoubtedly offensive and its content untruthful it is not "insulting" within the meaning of section 19' of the Public Order Act 1986. This conclusion is confirmed in the letter from the Solicitor General to the Rt. Hon David Hunt MP dated 26 September 1996.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In view of this, I am somewhat perplexed. If it is the case that Holocaust denial material is subject to prosecution under existing public order law, why are there no prosecutions of such material on that basis and why are the Law officers writing letters stating that prosecutions will not be brought because the material is not defined as 'insulting'?</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>I would personally be very happy if Public Order Legislation in either its existing or an amended form was to be used against Holocaust Denial material. My purpose in bringing forward my bill was to highlight the loophole in our existing legislation and get this loophole closed leading to effective legal action against Holocaust denial material in future."</p></blockquote>
Last week, I received a reply to that letter from the Prime Minister. In his letter of 4 March, the Prime Minister stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have to say that I am not convinced that it would be the right approach to change the legislation in this area, nor that such legislation would have any practical effect. There is no evidence to suggest that the British people are taken in by the lies of those who seek to deny the Holocaust, and Holocaust denial receives very little mainstream attention in this country."</p></blockquote>
We could argue about whether that is right or wrong, but the Prime Minister continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You asked about public order legislation. As you know Part III of the Public Order Act 1986 covers the circulation of racially inflammatory material. Prosecutions can be mounted against those responsible for material which is threatening, abusive or insulting and which is intended or likely to stir up racial hatred."</p></blockquote>
In my letter, I referred to a leaflet called "66 Questions and Answers on the Holocaust", which was circulated to schools in Hemel Hempstead in 1996. In his letter, the Prime Minister stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You cite the case of the leaflet…As you know, after careful consideration, the CPS concluded that this particular material was not 'insulting' within the meaning of the Act."</p></blockquote>
It was claimed in that material that the Holocaust was a fabrication, that there were no gas chambers, that they were built after the war, and that Jewish people were seeking international sympathy. It was particularly obnoxious material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Attorney-General has given his consent to prosecution in other cases where the material which formed the substance of the prosecution contained Holocaust denial as part of a wider antisemitic message."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, I assume that the Prime Minister's and the Government's position is that material which is generally anti-Semitic is liable to prosecution, but that material that denies the holocaust is not liable to prosecution. That is an interesting distinction. Does that mean that prosecutions are taking place against anti-Semitic material?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have done some research and contacted the Library. The legislation is specific to England and Wales, but I shall deal with Scotland later and perhaps other hon. Members will refer to Northern Ireland. Since 1979, there have been only about 80 prosecutions involving any form of incitement to racial hatred in England and Wales. That figure includes prosecutions involving material against all sorts of ethnic minorities as well as the publication of anti-Semitic material. On average, there are about three or four prosecutions a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an answer to a parliamentary question asked by the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), the Attorney-General stated that three people were prosecuted for incitement to racial hatred in 1992; two people in 1993; two people in 1995; seven people in 1995; and four people to October 1996. He stated:
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"During the last five years, I have declined to give my consent in a total of two cases.—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 31 October, 1996; Vol. 284, c. 181.]</p></blockquote>
So, there are not many prosecutions in general. Given the amount of generalised anti-Semitic and other racial hatred material that I and other people have drawn to the attention of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service, why are there so few prosecutions? We must question how the Public Order Act 1986 is being implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall:
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for giving way—I think that I can call him my hon. Friend today. Welcome though the Bill is, it is not the only change that needs to be made. Given that the evil, wicked Al-Massouri was able to insult the Jewish community, yet it was counsel's strong opinion that a prosecution would not succeed; given that the activities of Hizb-ut-Tahrir on the university campuses have not resulted in a prosecution because counsel advised that it would not succeed; and, given that people have been allowed to quote from the Koran, yet it has been held that prosecutions would not succeed, does my hon. Friend not agree that the law should be substantially strengthened, so that such hateful material can be stopped from going into our universities, schools and elsewhere?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is completely repugnant to those who lost all their relatives in the Holocaust to hear that it is denied. One constituent told me that he had lost 63 relatives in a camp, that he himself was in five camps and that he had had to walk from Auschwitz to Austria. He said that he did not need a route map because—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the length of the hon. Gentleman's intervention that concerns me, but the fact that he might stray slightly out of order if he does not return to the substance of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to the substance, Sir James, by talking about a victim of the Holocaust who had been in five camps and who then had to march from Auschwitz to Austria. He said that there was no need for a route map because there were so many dead bodies before him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gapes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. I can say only that it does not come within the scope of the Bill. We may be able to consider the wider aspects on another occasion. The existing provisions on incitement to racial hatred apply to everyone, regardless of their status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is specific to England and Wales because it seeks to amend the Public Order Act 1986. I asked the Scottish Office about the Holocaust being denied in Scotland. I received a reply from a Scottish Minister; he is also a peer of the realm, but I cannot remember his constituency—[HON. MEMBERS: "Edinburgh,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
West."] Yes, I mean the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), who is a peer of another realm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not want to interrupt the hon. Gentleman unduly, but his remarks apply rather more to clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gapes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fair enough, Sir James. I shall make those comments later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hartley Booth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apart from welcoming the Bill, I want the hon. Gentleman to clarify one point in clause 1. He referred earlier to crimes committed by Nazi Germany and its allies. Does the Bill cover crimes committed by the allies of Germany, or does it have jurisdiction over crimes committed only by Nazi Germany?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gapes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill is as it is worded. Hon. Members have clearly had the opportunity to table amendments, but there are none. We must take the text as it is. My remarks went slightly wider and I accept the hon. Gentleman's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 is the substance of the Bill. It is important to draw attention to the loophole in the existing legislation. The Bill would close that loophole and would introduce penalties for the offence as set out in the Public Order Act. It would therefore include clause 6 of that Act, which states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"This section does not apply to words or behaviour used or written material displayed, solely for the purpose of being included in a programme."</p></blockquote>
The Bill therefore meets the criticism—made for example in the 
	<i>Sunday Times</i> by Robert Harris—that the Bill would threaten historical programmes on the Holocaust. The education of our young people and others about the evil crimes of the Nazis and the origins and history of the Holocaust is a vital part of ensuring that it never happens again. The Bill does not intend to prevent historical and educational programmes and it would not prevent them, as some journalists who have criticised the Bill have implied that it would.

As the Prime Minister said, this is a sensitive area, but there is widespread support for action. I have received support from, among others, various organisations: the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Ajex and the Holocaust Educational Trust. I was pleased that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition stated, when opening the Anne Frank exhibition at Southwark cathedral on 29 January:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is a very strong case that denial of the Holocaust should be a specific offence."</p></blockquote>
As the 
	<i>Jewish Chronicle</i> editorial on 31 January put it:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The holocaust is undeniable. It is unique, and nothing like it must ever be allowed to happen again."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

with personal experience. My father arrived in this country in 1940 as a refugee from the Netherlands. He left behind an extended family in Amsterdam. On returning to the Netherlands in 1945, he went back to the streets where his family and all their relations had lived; he was met by an eerie silence. They had all gone, never to return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To give the Committee an example of the impact of the Holocaust, I shall give but one example of the kind of event that the documents we wish to prevent try to deny. At the age of two, a cousin of my father's was picked up in the middle of the night and taken away in a canvas-covered lorry with his mother, his father and his grandparents. His mother was pregnant. They were held in what could be called literally a concentration camp in north Holland, prior to deportation on those dreadful trains to the east. His mother gave birth and, because she suffered from a minor but highly contagious ailment, she and her two sons were taken away to a local hospital under German guard so that the contagion would not spread within the camp. When the trains were ready to go east, the Germans came to collect the mother and her two infants. A Dutch nurse had the presence of mind to give the German security guards the dead body of a two-year-old boy in place of my father's cousin. The nurse strapped the child to her back underneath her cloak, taping his mouth to keep him silent, and rode out of the hospital on a bicycle. She tok him to a relative of hers in the countryside who was a woodcutter. By chance, after the war my father spotted that child's name in a register of displaced persons and managed to find him. I had the privilege of meeting him—he is now a 50-year-old architect—0a few years ago in Israel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the dubious honour of keeping a register of my extended family. Fifty-six members of my family perished in the Holocaust. That is not a figment of imagination: the records of Yad Yashem in Israel document all those deaths. I have documents showing that relations of mine perished in such places as Auschwitz, Sobibor, Mauthausen and Buchenwald. There is no doubt that the Holocaust happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a gross travesty that any document can be passed on to the young people of the United Kingdom that would give any idea that the depths to which humanity can sink simply did not happen. What happened is a lesson to us all; it should never happen again. I fully support the Bill because misrepresentation that has racial consequences should not be allowed to stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not share with my hon. Friend the tragic events that he has outlined. However, I am chairman of the Inter-Parliamentary Council against Anti-Semitism. Like the hon. Member for Ilford, South, who introduced the Bill, I am not a Jew, but I have been convinced that legislation of this nature is necessary. The hon. Gentleman kindly quoted a number of letters written to me which demonstrate that the authorities find it difficult to prosecute for the offence of denying the Holocaust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Crown Prosecution Service has pointed out that it is possible to prove that such literature is offensive
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
and untruthful, but it is not possible to prove that it is insulting. Like my hon. Friends, I have received an enormous amount of literature of late, particularly since my views on the Bill became known. Recently, I accompanied the hon. and learned Member for Leicester, West (Mr. Janner) on two visits to Switzerland to seek the truth and justice for victims of the Holocaust over Nazi gold stolen from them and deposited in Swiss banks. I am appalled by the literature that I have received, some of it the most vicious, nasty literature that I have ever seen, which is directed towards the nonsensical idea that the Holocaust did not take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Leicester, West and I went recently to Germany to help set up a branch of the Inter-Parliamentary Council against Anti-Semitism. We were met by leading politicians in Germany, and the president of that new branch is the President of the Bundestag. The vice-presidents are the leaders or deputy leaders of the two main political parties. There was widespread support for the branch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found it difficult to answer why the United Kingdom, almost alone of the countries affected by the tragic events of the last war, was the only place where people could deny the existence of the Holocaust and escape prosecution. There is a lacuna in the law, which we should ensure exists no longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been appalled by the literature being fed to our schools and universities. Some of it denies the existence of the Holocaust, and seeks to justify what is alleged by the authors of this scurrilous material and to "put the record straight". It has been getting through to pupils in schools, and that is alarming. I look to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to reassure me that something is being done about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend, I too am concerned about what is happening in universities where there is systematic, vicious targeting of Jewish students, not only by Hizb-ut-Tahrir but by a number of other organisations. That must stop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals has decided to draw up a code of practice to help vice-chancellors and principals apply a uniform system of law on university and college campuses so that they can stamp out that outrageous behaviour. I urge the Government to consider carefully before they continue their policy, which the Home Secretary explained to one of the meetings of the Inter-Parliamentary Council against Anti-Semitism, that such a law would greatly inhibit the freedom of speech that has always been a bastion of human rights in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had so many debates about freedom of speech and you will know, Sir James, that it is no longer necessary to keep quoting that to stop vicious and outrageous material being perpetrated. Those debates began with the introduction of necessary legislation to stop racial hatred and those trying to arouse racial hatred. We have carried on with that so
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
that the guidelines are clear and people cannot resort to the vicious literature being sent to me. I tried to find a way under existing legislation to prevent that, but I have not been able to find an acceptable route on which we can rely to stop that nasty material being peddled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is with great regret that I have to say that we must further inhibit the freedom of spech but, in a way, this has nothing to do with freedom. People should never be allowed to deny the existence of the Holocaust. It did not take the Holocaust memorial, which I visited last year in Israel, to convince me. It did not take any particular significant event to convince me, it just took everything that I have always known to be true to convince me that people should not be allowed to insult in that way the Jewish community and those of us who have enormous sympathy with those who suffered so much. That is why I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will think carefully before allowing Government policy to be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East, indicated that the matter was being kept under review. The Prime Minister's recent speech to the Board of Deputies made it clear that the matter was being carefully considered. I very much hope that that consideration will result in the Bill moving swiftly onto the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although this is a sombre subject, I support with pleasure the speeches made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West (Mr. Hunt) and my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Arnold) following a characteristically dynamic speech by the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes). We thank him for taking the initiative in introducing the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not an easy subject, but a very upsetting one, especially for those of Jewish provenance. However, the House of Commons has to deal with it and I support most strongly that clause 1 stand part of the Bill. Once again, I thank the hon. Member for Ilford, South for the points that he made, with which I agree. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham for his moving account of a personal family episode in Holland, a country that suffered grievously from the evil Nazi programme of extermination of people from a particular race and other racial groups. I must also thank my right hon. Friend for his work on this matter and his kind reference to my question and the answer given to it in the House on 11 February.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose hon. Members would say that it is better not to be ignored in politics but to be noticed. One measure of that is receiving hate mail. Because of my enthusiasm for the European Union, I receive hate mail about Europe. One can imagine the difference in degree between receiving mildly amusing—usually amusing because it is so sick—hate mail on Europe from someone pursuing a particular campaign and the distress experienced by Jewish families and survivors of the Holocaust when the event is denied in disgusting material by members of strange and sick

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
movements, not only in educational institutions but even on the street.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have followed the subject for some time and share the general uneasiness about drafting law with a specific purpose relating to the nomenclature of an historical event, which is always an awkward matter for Ministers to deal with, so I have some sympathy in advance for the Minister who will respond to the debate. However, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West said, the issue must be tackled because of its special and deeply distressing nature and because of its humanitarian impact. There are always arguments, even in countries which have set an example in drafting rational and balanced anti-Holocaust denial legislation, and exceptions made when an historical crime has been perpetrated, such as denying a grotesque and evil mass event, unique in history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I was too young to be a member of the House of Commons at the time, I was always proud that, during the war, the House observed two minutes' silence when the first rumours filtered through about the extermination programmes in camps. It was so incredibly difficult for people to believe those rumours that some doubted whether they were true, but the whole Chamber of the House of Commons stood in silence on that occasion in anticipation of the awful truth that later emerged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the sponsor of the Bill said, by implication at least, the legislation proposed is not anti-German. I admire the way in which the Germans built up their democracy after the war and created anti-Holocaust denial legislation, as have other countries. It can be done. After all, throughout Europe, we share the same basis of law creation and use of words in legislation. Although we tend to think that the Anglo-Saxon tradition is somewhat different to the Dutch-Romance tradition, the text of French legislation is often very similar to ours and, as the hon. Member for Ilford, South mentioned, France, too, now has anti-Holocaust denial legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that, with the customary skill that we expect from Home Office draftsmen, it is possible to draft the necessary legislation under Government auspices if necessary, although I would prefer it if the Government would allow clause 1, in its present form, to stand part of the Bill. I believe I am right in saying that the hon. Gentleman, who has taken a wonderful initiative in promoting the Bill, has sought careful advice through the usual channels in Parliament on its textual drafting. He also kindly referred to the question that I asked the Prime Minister on 11 February.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read that outside the Anne Frank Memorial Forum, organised by 
	<i>The Times</i> and Dillons, there was a group of neo-Nazi thugs—I use that word deliberately, although I did not see them myself. Because of my indignation and anger—and because I found it so difficult to believe—I telephoned the newspaper to check that the reports were true. To
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
quote from my question to the Prime Minister, the thugs
	<br><blockquote><p>"paraded up and down denying that the second world war holocaust took place".</p></blockquote>
I then asked the Prime Minister:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Allowing for natural Home Office hesitation about an effective future text but bearing in mind that other countries have such legislation, may I wish my right hon. Friend well on his visit to the Board of Deputies of British Jews tomorrow and ask him to re-examine the issue and discuss it with the Home Secretary? May I remind him that all-party legislation on the subject was successfully launched in the House recently?—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 February 1997; Vol. 290, c. 137.]</p></blockquote>
I pay tribute to the answer given by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister because I understand the inner struggle that affects us all when considering this matter and the wish by the Prime Minister to respond to that suggestion when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think that everyone deplores the sentiments expressed by those who deny the holocaust. It undoubtedly occurred—it is a matter of absolute historical fact—and I can understand the hurt, the offence and the distress of those who suffered or whose families suffered at that time. It might be right to introduce a specific offence, and of course I shall discuss the matter again with my right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 February 1997; Vol. 290, c. 137.]</p></blockquote>
The follow-up was the exchange of letters with the promoter of the Bill and the Prime Minister's reply on 4 March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comment in paragraph 2 of the Prime Minister's answer must be compared with what has happened in the past and the reference made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West as chairman of the Inter-Parliamentary Council against Anti-Semitism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Timothy Kirkhope)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what my hon. Friend is saying about his exchanges with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, but it would have been helpful to the Committee if he had quoted a little further from 
	<i>Hansard</i> in describing his exchanges. My right hon. Friend said that he would consult with the Home Secretary but that he was dubious about the practical effects. He then set out very fairly his concerns about the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dykes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend and I would have done that. I was not trying to avoid the matter. I had already paid tribute to those who believe that the drafting of such legislation is problematic and difficult. I fully conceded that, but I am saying that it is not impossible and that may be the difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2 of the Prime Minister's letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is a very real danger that, if we were to make holocaust denial a specific offence, we would in fact be playing into the hands of extremists. By denying them their freedom of speech, we would give these people a legitimate cause to fight and enable them to attract far more sympathy and attention in the wider community than their ludicrous views justify."</p></blockquote>
I understand that. The comparison and the subject that I am about to mention are much less onerous, fearsome and dreadful than what happened in the holocaust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Heinrich Himmler said, in a report to one of his SS battalions before the end of the war, that the death of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
6 million Jews was an underestimate. That had been the estimate after the change of policy to the final solution decided at the Wannsee conference. I hope that those who suffered and the survivors will not misunderstand the comparison. I remember vividly—it was before I came to the House—that that is exactly what was said about proposed legislation on race relations. Many Conservative Members and some Labour Members and others hesitated and said that to introduce such legislation would play into the hands of extremists. I know from all the empirical evidence, which is why the comparison is direct although not so fearsome and ghastly, that race relations legislation—it was introduced before I came to the House but, like lain Macleod and others, I would have been a Conservative supporter of such legislation—prevents Asian people and black people from being insulted in pubs. There are some nasty people running pubs who make Asian people and black people wait until long after white customers have been served and such subtle actions are difficult to detect. No one shouts, "Get out, you nigger" or "Get out, you Asian" because people know that that is against the law. That is the direct comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other legitimate objection to clause 1 would be a reluctance to single out one historical event and to compare it with others. If asked about another dreadful example in recent history everyone would immediately think of the massacre by the Turks of the Armenians. One million civilian Armenians, including women and children, were massacred in 1918 at the end of the first world war. No one denies that that took place. It is an historical fact that everyone knows—even Turks admit that it happened. Incipient denial programmes are set up by dreadful people with campaigns of unbelievable written material. If hon. Members have not seen it, I recommend—if they have strong enough stomachs—that they read it to find out what is being said. That is another significant difference, which Ministers must deal with. I cannot think of any other examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Holocaust is certificated tragically and tangibly by the Nuremberg international law tribunal. German people and Nazis who were involved—when I say Nazis, I do not mean only Germans; plenty of non-German Nazis were involved in the programmes—admitted its existence after the war. The brave Germans who fought in the resistance against Hitler—those who were involved in the 1944 bomb plot, for example—some of whom themselves perished, knew what was going on. The Holocaust is certificated in international law—through an international tribunal and trial process—in horrendous, chilling detail. We know that it happened, but I am not saying that we should pass by and leave it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that clause 1 should stand part of the Bill and that the Bill should be enacted—I hope that its passage through the House is successful. I believe that the Government should, in responding to the Prime Minister's extremely considerate suggestion, think again and I hope that there will be further discussions between the Home Office and No. 10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my first childhood memories is of a youth club that my mother ran in what is now called Tower Hamlets. We were told—it was just before the war, so I must have been quite tiny—that one of our youth workers, who was Jewish, needed to be escorted out of the building because people holding snowballs into which ground glass had been pressed were waiting to attack him the minute he went outside. We were told that he would not be attacked if my mother and I were present. That was my first introduction to the sort of savagery that I increasingly saw, because my father was a political agent in Stepney. It was one of the reasons that both he and my mother were active in various organisations—they held strong views—and I am happy to say that I have been able to carry on some of their work. What is appalling is that the work against bigotry is still urgently needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to detain the Committee, but I do want to say that I believe that denial of the Holocaust is the fundamental brick in the most appalling building of bigotry and savagery, whose continuing existence we in the House of Commons forget at our peril. The stream of evil that is anti-Semitism is vicious and—what is most terrible—alive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my work with the Labour Friends of Israel, I have unfortunately had to take an active part against the deliberate targeting of female Jewish university students, which is a modern demonstration of something that I thought had been long overcome. I have seen the constant and clear demonstrations of anti-Semitism in our country, let alone others. Although there is some difficulty in drafting the legislation, if we allow the idea that one of the most appalling incidents in the history of the 20th century can be denied, we will fail all those who died—that matter is as important and fundamental as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not seek to deprive anyone of freedom of speech—not that I am frightened of those who have a savagery and fascism that is as alive today as it was in my childhood—but I believe that we have a responsibility. Those who allow the atmosphere of bigotry to develop, who pass by on the other side of the road and pretend that such attitudes no longer exist or believe that they can deal with bigotry by quietly ignoring it until it goes away, play into the hands of those who want to deny the Holocaust and everything that goes with it.

I was honoured when my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South asked me to be one of his sponsors, and I am delighted that my name appears on his Bill.

We need to say that those who want to continue to hate and to create hatred are not acceptable to the House of Commons, to the British

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to support my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South. For the past 19 years I have represented a constituency which has the largest Jewish community of any in western Europe. Over the years, a spate of this type of literature has appeared in the community. I have always sent it to the police hoping that those who perpetrate it would be found out and prosecuted. Often, it is difficult to discover who it putting out the literature. I have seen it in schools, it has been hand-delivered through people's letter boxes and so on and I believe that current legislation, although it covers most facets, is cloudy in this respect. We must beef it up and make absolutely sure that people are not allowed to get away with distributing literature in the community which is a complete distortion of the truth and of the evidence that my right hon. and hon. Friends described of the Nuremberg trials and of what even Germans admit happened during he last war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter, which has not been mentioned this morning, has worried me over the years. I shall not name the teams or clubs involved but I have evidence of anti-Semitic documentation being distributed in football supporters' clubs. That is a serious matter because of the hooliganism of some football supporters in the past. I believe that the literature is placed in those clubs deliberately to stir up the violent attitude that already exists in those places.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Due to the exigencies of the parliamentary timetable, I suspect that the Bill may not become law in this Session of Parliament. However, the all-party support that it has received has probably acted as a guarantee that although it may not be enacted in this Parliament, it may become law in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opponents of the Bill say that it would deny freedom of speech, but freedom of speech includes a sense of responsibility. We have accepted for a long time that racism is abhorrent to the vast majority of people in this country. Those who make racist speeches are liable to be prosecuted. It is even more abhorrent to deny the death of 6 million people; those who do so are some of the most evil, wicked individuals who do not deserve freedom of speech because what they say is untrue, hateful and insulting to the memory of those who died and to their relatives who are still alive. There are many relatives of Holocaust victims in London; they should not be insulted by the pernicious evil of individuals such as David Irvine, who should be subject to the full rigour of the law.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too welcome this admirable, short Bill. It deals with an issue that needs to be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask one or two rhetorical questions, which I shall answer myself. I shall do so to support some of the points that were made earlier. Is there evidence of the Holocaust? There is overwhelming evidence that it took place, and my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham gave poignant and emotional testimony to that. I have seen the Yad Yashem memorial in Jerusalem and it is impossible to deny the existence of the Holocaust unless one has another agenda. People who deny the Holocaust have another agenda. There can be no argument about that. Do people go around denying the existence of the Spanish armada or the invasion of William the Conqueror? Of course, they do not. However, those who deny the Holocaust have another agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is denial of the Holocaust offensive? Of course, it is. I would argue that it is more than that. I am a lawyer and I believe that one could argue that denial of the Holocaust is cruel, causes pain and is in the nature of an assault on the dignity of those individuals who lost family members. Denial of the Holocaust is offensive. Therefore, it is criminal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the existing law adequate? In 1993, I presented the Racial Hatred and Violence Bill to the House and three clauses were ultimately accepted. At that time, I looked throughout British legislation to see whether a law was in place to cope with such appalling problems. I found that the existing law was totally inadequate. Therefore, we must go forward and the Bill will fit neatly into the Public Order Act 1986. Because it fits into existing legislation and amplifies it, I support the way in which it is drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall), who is about to be my successor, referred to freedom of speech. On occasions, we have to deal with important issues by making exceptions to the law—blasphemy was a middle ages exception. When there is obvious evidence that something, such as the commission of a crime, overrides freedom of speech, exceptions are made in British law. We have heard other examples from around the world. Freedom of speech is a factor that can be put to one side in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important factor is a person's intention. As we all know, a person must intend to commit an offence and courts must test that intention. Exceptions can be made unless overwhelming circumstances apply. In this case, there is overwhelming evidence that anyone who spreads offensive material—I have received such vile stuff—must have intended to do so. The wording in clause 1(2) that such behaviour
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be deemed to be intended to stir up racial hatred"</p></blockquote>
is totally justified. Anyone who produces such literature must intend it to be offensive and cruel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is what we are doing enough? I must answer no to that. We are not doing enough. We need something
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two other elements that I would like to accompany the Bill. The first is a greater emphasis on the gathering of evidence. I should like the police to set up a small unit to conduct research into new ways of tracking down people who perpetrate racial hatred. It could be done by DNA tests or through some new technique. It is a crying shame that only a few people are prosecuted each year for these offences. One way of deterring them is to let them know that they are likely to be caught. Secondly, I should like a broader band of information to be given to school children to make these culprits' peers admit that the Holocaust happened and to exert pressure on them. Information coming through the new museums and in information packs to schools is fine, but much more information is needed alongside the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Finchley (Mr. Booth) about the need for the police to set up a skilled, dedicated unit to investigate racial attacks and activities that promote racial hatred. Whenever Scotland Yard has organised a team to investigate a specific aspect of crime, the results have been very good. I diagree with the suggestion that different police forces would replicate these skills, re-inventing the wheel, as it were, in different parts of the country. I am convinced that we would make great progress in tackling racial abuse if Scotland Yard set up such a squad. That is something that I called for before I entered Parliament and have been calling for since.

I did not intend to speak this morning, but I was as moved as anyone by the speeches from both sides of the Committee and by the emotion that they revealed. I was especially moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham' s account of his tragic family circumstances, which can find an echo in any synagogue or among any group of Jewish people who had relatives in Germany and other parts of central Europe at the time. This is a matter of tremendous historical importance and current relevance to the Jewish community and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that those who would deny the Holocaust are a relatively small, but for all that evil, group of weirdos and perverts whose agenda goes beyond simply seeking to deny what happened. Their creed is authoritarianism. They blame elements of the population—the Jewish people one day, Asians
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
another, homosexuals have their time and no doubt these people also have views on women—for most of society's ills. They are a peculiar, unfortunate band of people. Most are thugs as thick as two short planks. But some are their leaders and they are not stupid—they know precisely what they are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit that I have some worries about the Bill. I should have congratulated the hon. Member for Ilford, South on presenting it and I do so now. This morning's debate, with the contributions that several hon. Members have made, is part of his achievement. We should, however, take seriously the fact that the Home Office and others—including the writer of an editorial in the 
	<i>Jewish Chronicle</i>—are questioning whether we should proceed in the way that we are considering. I say so because the leaders of the sort of operations that we have been discussing have adopted the agenda of obtaining maximum publicity. They would relish the rows that would go on in court under the Bill. My argument is not exhaustive and I recognise that arguments can be made on both sides, but I am somewhat nervous about the form of the proposal and whether it might allow people to raise the level of their game.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend has thought a great deal about the matter. Will he accept from me that much fuss derives from rows in court about what constitutes an intention to commit an act? As the measure that we are considering eliminates that debate and reduces the question to one of strict liability, the relevant prosecutions would be speedy and efficient and would minimise the problems that he has mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is right, things would be fine, but I wonder about it. Like most members of the Committee, I have visited the Yad Yashem memorial more than once and I have been as moved as anyone by the horrendous detail. It is not the macro, but the micro-nastiness that affects one, just as some of the most moving scenes in "Schindler' s List" showed the carelessness with which some of the deeds were done. Going around Yad Yashem, one realises that some of the details are hazy. That is not a question of denial of anything to do with the Holocaust, it is just that some of the detail is not known, despite the marvellous work done by Yad Yashem committees and others to try to gather such detail. Was the number of people involved 6 million, 5.5 million or 6.5 million? That is not entirely clear. My worry is that some people who were taken to court for a partial denial of the Holocaust would relish going through the details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have outlined is only a partial concern and I understand both sides of the argument. The Home Office has done a great deal of work on the matter. I know that my hon. Friend the Minister has consulted widely in his constituency and outside it and has listened to all the various arguments on the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, South was right to say that it would be practically impossible to pass the Bill in the current Session of Parliament. We are dealing with a rehearsal for what may happen in the next Parliament. It would be best if the ideas of the hon. Member for Ilford, South could be taken up by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
the Home Office and incorporated into a Bill that would not give rise to the concerns that the Home Office has expressed and I have echoed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in favour of something being done about Holocaust denial, but I am nervous about the use to which the evil people who perpetrate that denial might put the Bill. I am confident, however, that if the Home Office understands the will of both sides of the House that something should be done, action can be taken early in the next Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I say how grateful I am to the hon. Member for Ilford, South for giving us an opportunity to debate an extremely important issue, which causes great concern to many people. I share that concern and I reply to the debate not only as the Minister in the Home Office responsible for, among other matters, race relations, but as chairman of the United Kingdom co-ordinating committee for the European year against racism, xenophobia and antisemitism, which is this year, and as a Member of Parliament with one of the largest Jewish communities in the country in his constituency. On those bases alone, Sir James, you will appreciate that I am especially interested in and concerned about this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reference to intolerance in the Home Office made by the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich was a little unworthy of her. As far as such matters are concerned, there is no question of intolerance. Indeed, there is an enormous concern to hear all points of view and to do what is best as a result of hearing them. There is no question of intolerance—at least not as far as I am concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if my cruel words hurt the Minister's perceptions. I simply believe that a little more rigour and a few more prosecutions of those who perpetuate racial hatred would demonstrate better than any words the attitude of the Home Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that I do not need to remind the hon. Lady, given her long experience in the House, that it is not the Home Office that prosecutes, but the prosecuting authority, when it has sufficient evidence. I shall return to that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ilford, South and, indeed, other members of the Committee have presented extremely moving arguments in support of the Bill. I was particularly moved by the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham, as were other members of the Committee. Hitler's attempt to eradicate the Jewish people has undoubtedly cast a shadow over this century. My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) said that there may be some doubts about the numbers. As far as I am concerned, at least 6 million Jews were murdered by cold-blooded, systematic extermination. The depth and scale of such evil is almost impossible to grasp.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people would have us believe that the Holocaust did not happen. Tragically and shamefully,
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
we all know that it certainly did. It is up to us to ensure that our generation and, indeed, future generations, never forget the barbarity and bloodshed that followed in Nazi Germany from an ideology of hatred and fear. We must never let those ideas regain ascendancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All right-minded people are appalled by those who seek to deny the reality of the Holocaust. Understandably, the issue is of especial concern to members of the Jewish community. My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West rightly suggested that I have had extremely comprehensive discussions on the subject with many members of the Jewish community—not only in my constituency and in the country as a whole, but also with people with experience of laws in other parts of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of January, I contributed to a debate at a conference on the academic response to anti-Semitism in Europe. I am aware of the strength of feeling. The hon. Member for Ilford, South said that he had also received some mixed responses to his ideas—he told us that he had received much support, but that he had also received hate mail. I have received expressions of support for the Bill and I have received hate mail, but I have also received—the hon. Gentleman did not mention that he had, but he must have—correspondence from some members of the Jewish community expressing their uncertainty and unhappiness about the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the need for and, more importantly, the benefits of any changes to existing legislation in this sphere, such as those that the hon. Gentleman has suggested. My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West asked about the present powers of the police. A specialist unit in the Metropolitan police deals with these matters. We in the Home Department are much concerned with unpleasant and anti-Semitic material on the Internet and are anxious to find new ways of dealing with that. As we are not debating it specifically this morning, I shall not test your patience, Sir James, but the Internet is becoming a matter of increasing concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to discuss whether there is evidence to suggest that the British people are taken in by the lies of those who seek to deny the Holocaust. This morning's debate is therefore useful. The idea that there is such evidence is in stark contrast to the interest generated by films such as "Schindler' s List". All but a very small number of people know that the Holocaust was one of the vilest crimes of history. The lies and evasions of bigots cannot long survive the cool scrutiny of reason, as my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West has said. Those lies are best confronted by firm rebuttal and, most importantly, by education. Woodrow Wilson, the American President, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The wisest thing to do with a fool is to encourage him to hire a hall and discourse to his fellow citizens. Nothing chills nonsense like exposure to the air."</p></blockquote>
I fear that to make Holocaust denial a specific offence, as the hon. Member for Ilford, South wishes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
to do, might be counter-productive. We have heard this morning and on other occasions that it should be an offence because of the symbolic value of declaring that the opinions expressed by such people will not be tolerated. On the contrary, there is a real risk that we would elevate the extremists to a level of importance that they simply do not deserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following my hon. Friend's point that some people would wallow in and enjoy the publicity, would he apply his mind to evidence that those who perpetrate this muck are cowardly? If they were not, they would put their names on what they print. Given that they are cowardly, is not there a great likelihood that they would not want to go to court or go for the glorification of which the Minister is trying to persuade us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend rehearsed his argument about the question of the evidential situation a short time ago. There is undoubtedly a problem at present with getting satisfactory prosecutions. One needs evidence in order to comply with the law. However, the problem with my hon. Friend's argument is that simply to invoke a new head for the Public Order Act 1986 would be simply to create something that has to be proved. I am not trying to shelter behind technical matters, although there are technical difficulties with the Bill, but this point has been raised. The difficulty is that a new head on the issue of whether the Holocaust actually took place would generate a completely new industry among those who wished to have the forum to debate that issue more fully by going to court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to Woodrow Wilson, a man for whom I have great respect. However, would not the Minister accept that Wilson's comment about putting a person before his peers or in a public hall was rather optimistic? Adolf Hitler, for example, spoke to many people in public halls. Today, people do the same, but they do not convince others that they are fools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but it does not alter my general point. I said earlier that the proposal would elevate the extremist to a level of importance that he does not deserve. It has been suggested that such people are cowards. Well, that may or may not be right; I am not sure whether I share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Finchley. If the arguments of such people were deployed in a court setting and if we took away or suppressed their freedom of speech, they might attract more attention—and perhaps more sympathy—in the wider community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Bill is about the denial of a fact—the fact of the Holocaust? He was discussing the opinions of those odious people. Those are two completely separate matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has almost hit the nail on the head. He said that the Holocaust was a fact, and I agree with him. The Bill would take a fact—
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
which we acknowledge to be a fact—and put it in a position in which it could be challenged. No Committee member would for one moment deny that the Holocaust was a fact. Numerous threads are involved. The Public Order Act 1986 is not a perfect piece of legislation but it is available when evidence can be produced. We go out of our way to ensure that we teach the facts about the Holocaust. There is no question, as far as we are concerned, about the fact that the Holocaust took place. Some try to deny it, but there is no reason why we should accept their thesis—right or wrong—in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall develop my argument a little further, although I do not want to detain the Committee for long—this is, after all, the Bill of the hon. Member for Ilford, South. When he introduced the Bill in the House, he said that there was no such thing as absolute freedom of speech. That argument has been repeated in Committee today by the hon. Member for Crewe and Natwich and others. We should consider that argument carefully—freedom of speech may not be an absolute. I agree entirely with that argument, but I do not think that we should lightly turn away from the view that Parliament has had for a long time on such matters. Parliament concluded that the freedom to express minority views should be preserved—however repugnant those views may be—except when public order and safety are threatened. With regard to Holocaust denial, we are discussing not minority views but downright lies. The same principle must have some application. It has been a sound principle and it has provided a firm foundation for our legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation to deal with incitement to racial hatred exists in the context of offences concerning public order. If it can be shown that racist literature or material is threatening, abusive and insulting and that it is intended or likely to stir up racial hatred, the authors, publishers, and distributors can be prosecuted under the Public Order Act 1986, and face imprisonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much holocaust denial material of course falls below that threshold, but when it poses a real threat—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bendall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that such material might fall below the threshold, but surely the obvious and logical conclusion is that such material does incite people because of the hatred that it contains.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, in fact, Holocaust denial has such a result, it would be covered by existing legislation. I, for one, am extremely anxious that those with evidence of that kind should bring it to the attention of the authorities. I myself will be particularly vigorous in supporting the prosecution of those responsible. Indeed, as we speak cases are before the court which concern material containing Holocaust denial as part of a wider anti-Semitic and racist message. Therefore the matter can be and is being actioned under the current law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to the importance of ensuring that such ideas never again gain ascendancy. Many people across the world are working hard to keep the memory and the lessons of the Holocaust alive. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Government have also played their part. The national curriculum for history, as I am sure members of the Committee know, requires all 11 to 14-year-old pupils to be taught about the Holocaust as part of a compulsory unit on the 20th century world. Last year, the Department for Education and Employment also sent out special teaching packs to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the second world war, which highlighted the impact of the Holocaust on Jewish people across the world. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West mentioned that. Furthermore, with the help of funding, the imperial war musuem is planning a major, permanent exhibition on the Holocaust which is due to open at the beginning of the new millennium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said initially that I did not think that the Bill was the right vehicle for pursuing these matters and that it could have adverse consequences. However, I am in no doubt that all of us here share the same objectives. We are all concerned for the welfare of the Jewish community, which is such an integral and valued part of British society. We all recognise the importance of ensuring that the memory of those dreadful events of the 1930s and 1940s is certainly not lost or distorted, and we all want to safeguard this country's cherished freedoms and tradition of tolerance. The question is how best to achieve those objectives. The answers are not clear cut. As I said, I have had many discussions and I know from them that views differ, even within the Jewish community. My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West referred to the 
	<i>Jewish Chronicle,</i> and there are others, to whom we can refer. The executive director of the Institute for Jewish Policy Research recently expressed concern about criminalising denial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to the arguments that have been advanced today, not only by the hon. Member for Ilford, South but by the other supporters of his Bill who are here this morning. I have sympathy with those arguments but, in the final analysis, I must make it clear that the Government are not persuaded by them. Our current legislation is long standing and reflects sound principles. It strikes the right balance, and we could not upset that balance without risks. We cannot therefore support clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gapes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the Government are taking that attitude. I had hoped that we could make more progress, but with the Government taking that stance it is, as the hon. Member for Hendon, South said earlier, unlikely that we will get legislation through in this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, however, that the speeches from all sides indicate that the issue will not go away. We will return to it, either in the immediate future or in a few months' time. The issue is such that that will be necessary as the anti-Semitic material that specifically denies the Holocaust will continue. There is an international network—material is published in one country and disseminated in another. Other European countries, including Germany and France, have no difficulty in having legislation on their statute books,
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
even though there are no doubt people in those countries who also argue that bringing a prosecution might give publicity to those who are prosecuted. Nevertheless, they are prosecuted. Those responsible, including British citizens, have been prosecuted in other countries for putting out such material.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene on the hon. Gentleman at this stage, but he said that other countries have such legislation in place. Despite some problems, this country has a good record in comparison with countries that have such legislation. Is the hon. Gentleman telling the Committee that the existence of that legislation in other countries has resulted in a great reduction in the activities of vile neo-Nazis? The records do not show that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gapes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that Germany has tough Holocaust denial legislation has seriously inhibited the revival of Nazi and neo-Nazi politics there. No one can make assumptions about what the position would have been in different countries regardless of the legislation at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we have a problem in this country, although it is not the same as the problems in other countries. We know that material is circulated that is grossly offensive and insulting to the recipients. When my constituents receive anti-Semitic hate material that denies the Holocaust, they rightly want something done about it. They are not happy when we tell them that we will do nothing about it because that would give those responsible undue publicity. That causes grave offence to such people, who include the relatives of Holocaust survivors and even the survivors themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a choice between education or legal action. Of course, we all want education and we support the welcome initiative of the imperial war museum. The organisations that have made a major contribution to such education, including the Holocaust Educational Trust, support my Bill. The Board of Deputies of British Jews also supports it. References have been made to divisions and differences in the Jewish community. I accept that a few individuals have—on freedom of speech grounds or because they question the practicality—taken a view. Some of those criticisms, however, related to the position prior to the Bill's publication. The Bill is being put in the context of the Public Order Act 1986 and the penalties and qualifications in that Act will apply. Many of the concerns that have been expressed are answered by the way in which the Bill is being presented today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not detain the Committee unduly because we have to deal with clause 2 and I am conscious of the fact that time is moving on. The Bill, or something like it, is necessary. It would provide a clear signal that the material that we are discussing is not acceptable, as has been said. It would also reassure people who suffer as a result of such material. It would make a contribution in this country to the international fight against organisations and groups
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
whose agenda is to undermine democracy and promote authoritarian and hatred-based politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time has come for us to deal with the loophole in existing legislation. We prosecute only two, three or four people a year for the gamut of material that incites racial hatred. Every year, I refer far more cases than that to the Director of Public Prosecutions and I am sure that other Members of Parliament have had similar experiences. If the prosecutions are not happening, something in the system is wrong. The material is being circulated and received and it needs to be dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I referred in my introduction to the situation in Scotland. A written answer that I received from the Minister of State, Scottish Office said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My noble and learned Friend the Lord Advocate informs me that he has no policy specifically directed to the prosecution of holocaust denial material.—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 February 1997; Vol. 291, c. 392.]</p></blockquote>
When I asked how many prosecutions relating to Holocaust denial material there have been in Scotland in each year since 1979 and how many prosecutions there have been for incitement to racial hatred in Scotland since 1979, I received a written answer from the Minister of State saying
	<br><blockquote><p>"My noble and learned Friend the Lord Advocate informs me that the information requested is not available."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 February 1997; Vol.. 291, c. 392.]</p></blockquote>
That is a serious problem and we need to deal with that matter in Scotland as well as in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) will want to refer to the situation in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the opportunity to be a sponsor of the Bill and, in general, I support the arguments that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my problems is that the Government are opposing the Bill in Committee and I therefore plead with them to reconsider the position and to apply the Bill to Northern Ireland. I do so for several reasons. First, the Minister referred to the problems that might
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
arise out of such legislation. The Government have had no difficulty passing legislation for Northern Ireland concerning fair employment and other issues that have caused problems, including the fact that having a picture of the Queen is now seen as an offence in certain people's eyes. It seems to me that the Government should re-examine that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect that concerns me is that there are victims of the Holocaust people in Northern Ireland who were. One reason why there has been no reaction that has spurred a conviction or at least a charge on this issue, is that they may perhaps have been more forgiving than those who are now seeking to deny the Holocaust and who have their own agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gravesham recounted a moving experience from his family record, but we have an eye witness of the Holocaust present in the Committee in the person of the Chairman, who happened to be one of the first people to go into Belsen when the area was relieved. We learned from his experience of that, and of going back there on the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, the sense of the place and the horror that filled people who visited there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be clear about how we will use the Bill. Without prolonging the arguments, I put on record that we want to support the Bill for the United Kingdom as a whole, so it must be implemented first in England and Wales and I ask that there is a closer examination of the reasons given by the Government for objecting to the legislation. We have all lived with revisionism, but this is not merely revisionism, which we have experienced in modern Northern Ireland and when attempts were made to tone down the numbers of people massacred in 1641. I do not, therefore, accept the argument of the hon. Member for Harrow, West. The harsh reality is that we are dealing with active denial of the event and we should be firmer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gapes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. When the time comes for legislation to go on to the statute book, we have to work on the basis that such legislation will apply to the whole of the United Kingdom as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to detain the Committee any longer. I am grateful for the opportunity that we have had this morning to raise these issues. I hope that we will be able to make further progress on the Bill and that before too long there will be legislation on the statute book that makes it a criminal offence to deny that the Holocaust took place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
