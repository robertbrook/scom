	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Dorrell)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Ukraine) Order 1993.</p></blockquote>
I welcome you to the Chair, Dr. Blackburn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) for his interest in these double taxation treaties, which are an important part of the world trading system. They facilitate the flow of capital around the world and they integrate the parties to double taxation treaties into the world trading system, which is in the interests not only of this country but of our treaty partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The double taxation treaty with the Ukraine marks an important step forward in the process of integrating the various component parts of the former Soviet Union into the world trading system. It is the first double taxation treaty with a former Soviet Union country. The treaty was signed at the time of President Kravchuk's visit to the United Kingdom in February. It marks an important step forward in the history of the former Soviet Union and in the integration of Ukraine into the world trading system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to draw the Committee's attention to two particular aspects of the treaty. First, it provides that taxing rights in the context of royalty and interest flows rest with the resident state, not with the receiving state. That is at the request of Ukraine because it is keen to attract an inward flow of technology and it does not want to exercise a taxing right on royalty flows associated with that technology back to the owner of the technology in the United Kingdom. We welcome that: it is a departure from the OECD standard treaty, a copy of which I can see in front of the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second aspect is that the treaty provides that investments made from this country in Ukraine will not be subject to the rules that the Ukrainian authorities apply to its own enterprises, limiting the tax deductibility of salaries and interest on long-term debt. Those rules would inhibit the flow of British capital and British interest in investment in Ukraine. The Ukrainians have agreed that those rules should not apply to investment from this country, which once again shows the seriousness of their intention to integrate their economy into the world trading system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome that interest and I commend the treaty to the Committee as giving tangible expression to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.33 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome you, Dr. Blackburn, to the Chair. I am pleased that you are presiding over this important debate. I recall
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
the last time that you presided over our discussions of such matters. You clearly did such a splendid job that your career path has been smoothed so that you can do it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary has set out the background to the treaty and welcomed it as the first such treaty to be made with a country that was once part of the Soviet Union. I, too, welcome the agreement on that basis. However, I should like to explore with the Financial Secretary several issues pertaining to the treaty and the circumstances in which it has come to fruition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The treaty is a bold step forward for Ukraine. As the Financial Secretary said, it largely conforms to the OECD model. I saw a glint of enthusiasm in his eye when he noticed that I had it with me. It is now required reading in the modern Labour party. The days when we regarded such matters as the workings of the capitalist system and not for us are over, just as they seem to be over in Ukraine. However, they do not seem to be over in the European Commission. I read in the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> of 25 June 1992 that the Commission is issuing warnings on double taxation agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"EC governments yesterday were warned not to enter into double taxation agreements with countries outside the EC as some treaties could be potentially discriminatory.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Mrs. Christiane Scrivener, the commissioner responsible for fiscal matters, confirmed that the European Commission was studying bilateral double taxation treaties to establish whether they disadvantaged companies based in other EC countries."</p></blockquote>
The context of that statement is the double taxation treaty between Germany and the United States of America. We have our own difficulties at the moment with our double taxation treaty with the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the treaty meet the fears of Mrs. Scrivener? Have we entered into an agreement that disadvantages our partners in the European Community? If so, will the Financial Secretary draw the attention of the Committee to the clauses that might be disadvantageous and explain the Government's thinking? I am sure that the Government will have weighed the matter before signing the treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Financial Secretary said, the agreement broadly conforms to the OECD model. Will he confirm that the two points that he highlighted are the only two points that mark a serious departure from OECD orthodoxy on such matters? I want to ask him about a number of issues. The first is the settling of disputes by mutual agreement. For example, a clause in article 4 of the treaty, which deals with residency, states that a dispute between two parties will be settled by mutual agreement in the first instance. Article 26 specifically refers to "mutual agreement."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the mechanisms for resolving such matters, not just on our side—where they are well established and understood—but on the Ukrainian side? Although institutions for dealing with them are well established in the context of the United Kingdom, I cannot believe that they are well established or well integrated in the context of Ukraine. Those matters are new for a former communist state. Members of the Committee will be interested to learn what machinery has been put in place for dealing with the important range of international obligations and commitments that Ukraine is making under the treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The treaty implies far-reaching changes in the tax structure and regime in Ukraine—a factor that the Financial Secretary mentioned. It is an ambitious undertaking for Ukraine, which is moving fast. Given that we are entering into the agreement with them it is right for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
the Committee to know how far the arrangements are advanced in Ukrainian society and what its mechanisms are for levying capital taxation—capital gains tax, corporation tax, even income tax and indirect taxes. It is right that we know what collection arrangements there are in the Ukraine, how they interface with the treaty and how the Financial Secretary envisages progress being made in a republic that, as yet, lacks the full panoply of a modern western state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 19 of the order contains the usual provisions for Government service, and protects public servants generally. Article 28 is always inserted to protect the interests of diplomatic missions overseas. The negotiators of these matters take a special interest in the treatment of civil servants' overseas postings; a special clause protects their position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Ukraine, everyone will have been a public servant before the change of regime from Communism to independence. It follows, therefore, that the article as it relates to pension rights—if they accrue in the Ukraine—must cover everyone, at least in as much as it has historical impact. Can the Financial Secretary say whether pension rights are accrued under the current system in that country or whether the obligations of the former regime are carried over and, if they are, whether there is blanket cover under the order. I realise that the treatment of income will have altered as there is no longer a Communist Government. Can the Minister say something about accrual of income and how it will be handled under the order?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary is aware—we have discussed these subjects late at night, usually during debates on Finance Bills—that Opposition Members are greatly concerned above tax avoidance. We feel sometimes that Conservative Members do not fully share our enthusiasms, but that may be our misunderstanding. The Minister will recall the discussions of 1987 which resulted in publication of the United Nations document "Contributions to International Co-operation in Tax Matters", which was an honest international attempt to tackle some of the difficult issues that arise when companies and individuals derive unintended benefits from double taxation treaties. The United Nations deliberations will have been considered widely by member states. Can the Financial Secretary say how far those deliberations are reflected in the treaty?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's main concerns relate not so much to tax treatment of individuals but to that of businesses. Article 11 refers to tax treatment of interest. Article 6 appears to deal with circumstances of joint ventures between the Ukraine and Britain. This is not an OECD standard. Those matters may have been covered by the Financial Secretary in his opening remarks. If not, will he tell us why a non-OECD standard clause is in this part of the order and—relative to paragraph 6 of article 11—say whether the purpose was to provide special treatment for joint ventures between the United Kingdom and the Ukraine? Can he tell us, too, whether paragraph 7 of that article is aimed at tax avoidance, which might otherwise be possible under the rest of the article?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friends, who are following the debate intently, would welcome an assurance that the order does not open another debt equity debate similar to that in our debates during the passage of Finance Bills in 1991 and 1992. We should also like to know whether the tax treatment of those
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
matters is either the same in both countries or is covered by the treaty in such a way that there is no opportunity for what the Americans call double dipping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious, too, about transfer pricing. The United Kingdom ratified the arbitration convention to deal with these matters on 18 December 1992. It was signed by the 12 member states of the European Community; I believe that we were the fourth to ratify the agreement. The Treasury issued a triumphalist press statement at the time, saying that the purpose of the convention was to eliminate double taxation which could arise if a transfer pricing adjustment was made in one contracting state and the other contracting state involved did not make a corresponding downwards adjustment. We understand the principle—God knows, it comes up every year in the Finance Bill—but can the Financial Secretary say how the principle is addressed in the treaty? The opportunities for wholesale tax avoidance in the early development of the Ukrainian economy may be limited. In a rapidly developing economy, mechanisms could be put in place that are a serious drain either on the Ukrainian Exchequer or on our own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1988 Budget and Finance Bill, we considered the double taxation treatment of capital gains from intra-group share exchanges. The purpose was to prevent gains or losses being charged or allowed more than once. We are anxious about people who are charged more than once, but even more concerned about those whose transactions are allowed more than once. The Government have a position on these matters and I hope that it is reflected in the treaty. I could not quite satisfy myself that the way in which it was constructed would allay our anxieties, expressed in Committee. However, since the Government legislated for it domestically, I assume that the effect would be that it sits alongside the treaty and that the 1988 Finance Bill would take effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 10 deals with capital gains. The Government recently issued a statement of practice dated June 1988—section 10 of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979 refers to capital gains tax and the double taxation provisions set out in sections 788 and 806 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. The statement of practice that was issued must also, presumably, sit alongside this treaty. Can the Minister say exactly how that will work in practice in the specific circumstances of the Ukrainian economy? These general questions are being asked not just by me but by people across the country. We await with interest the Financial Secretary's reply, particularly in regard to statements that his Department has issued concerning double taxation treaties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a wider debate about the workings of double taxation treaties, which the Chancellor of the Exchequer sparked when he announced that if matters regarding unitary tax and our relationship with the United States were not sorted out, by the end of the year we would undertake retaliatory action, against at least the great state of California, if not the United States. That is a significant issue and in some ways a frightening prospect. No one would want gratuitously to launch a trade war between Great Britain and the United States. After all, our economies are substantially inter-twined and we both benefit from the moves toward free trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the purpose of the treaty and the spirit that underpins it is to enable free trade between Great Britain and the Ukraine. How do the agreements that we are entering into with the Ukraine sit alongside our obligations
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0563">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
to our partners in the European Community? They do not all share our commitment to free trade, particularly when agricultural produce is involved. I would like western European markets to be opened up to eastern Europe and free trade between us to be facilitated. I hope that the treaty constitutes a step in what is going to be a long journey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I broadly welcome the treaty, but important questions have to be asked, questions that engage the interest of the country. I know that the Financial Secretary will respond to my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East on his obviously profound knowledge of, and interest in, bilateral matters between Britain and the Ukraine. He said that the treaty represented a bold step forward for the Ukraine into the free enterprise market economies that the western world has been living in, and benefiting from, for many years. I agree with his description of the treaty as playing an important part in that process. I welcome the bold step taken not just by the Ukraine, but the Labour party in its interest in providing an infrastructure which facilitates the integration of such economies into the trading system. I also welcome its newfound enthusiasm, referred to by the hon. Gentleman as he was concluding, for free trade. I warmly endorse the interest in bilateral trade between Britain and eastern Europe and look forward to that new principle being extended more broadly into the economic policy contributions made from the Opposition Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me a series of questions which I shall try to answer, but not necessarily in the order that they were asked. He asked about the nature of the Ukrainian tax system from which double tax relief is being sought. I hope that he will forgive me if I do not go through the Ukrainian tax code, but he might like to know the basic outline of the tax on profit of enterprises. It is levied at 30 per cent. on gross profits, although for joint ventures in which foreign participation meets certain minimum requirements the rate is reduced to 15 per cent. and the income tax on citizens of the Ukraine, foreign citizens and stateless persons is applied on the basis that Ukrainian citizens and foreigners living in the Ukraine for more than 183 days in a calendar year are chargeable on their world-wide income. The tax rate for individuals whose salary is paid in karbovantsi is progressive up to a top rate of 50 per cent. applicable to the taxable income exceeding 60,000 karbovantsi a month. That is the basic provision of the corporation and income tax system in the Ukraine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the Government's commitment to eliminating tax avoidance, which I agree is an important issue. The principle that underlines the double taxation treaty must be to try to avoid the double taxation of profits and income—capital gains—but, to ensure that, wherever possible in the bilateral relations between the two states, income is at least taxed once. The United Kingdom's treaties are negotiated with the purpose of achieving such results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 23 of the treaty will continue to allow that to happen. However, when domestic provisions in one country combine with the convention to result in avoidance of all taxation—or a very much reduced rate of taxation—article 23 restores the taxation rights of the state of source on that income. I hope that that will put hon. Gentleman's concerns on that subject to rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
The hon. Gentleman was very concerned about article 19, particularly its effect on pensions. He expressed the view that the majority of Ukranians used to be employed by the state. That, of course, used to be true, but it is no longer true. There is a growing private sector, in which employees will be subject to the non-governmental pensions article of the treaty. The Government service article enforces the basic proposition that when a Government pay an employee for Government service, that payment is taxable in the country in which the payment is made. The hon. Gentleman might also be interested to know that article 19 follows closely the OECD model code on those subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the hon. Gentleman's questions about sub-paragraphs (6) and (7) of article 11, which is the interest article of the treaty. He asked about the effect of those two sub-paragraphs. Sub-paragraph (6) prevents interest that is paid by a company resident in one country to a company resident in the other country being treated as a dividend or distribution, except when the recipient company is controlled by residents of the other country. Sub-paragraph (7) states that the provisions of the article will not apply if the debt claim in respect of which interest is paid was created or assigned mainly to obtain the benefit of article 11—the interest article to the treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about article 9, which provides that suitable arms' length adjustments may be made in determining the profits of an enterprise carried on by a resident of one country in circumstances in which there is an element of common control with an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other county and when artificial conditions are made between the two enterprises. An article containing such a provision is generally included in our double taxation conventions and accords with OECD principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about transfer pricing. The arms' length principle is reflected throughout the treaty, but especially so in article 10, which deals with associated enterprises. It provides that suitable arms' length adjustments may be made in determining the profits of enterprises reseident in either Ukraine or the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about settling differences between either the taxpayer and the tax authorities or between the two tax authorities. As between the taxpayer and the tax authorities—either in this country or in Ukraine—that is a matter for domestic law. The issue that matters in the context of a double taxation treaty is the way in which the two jurisdictions reconcile their differences. That is what is set out in the treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ukrainian Ministry of Finance is specified in article 3 as the competent authority. I am advised that it has set up a division within the Department to deal with the provisions of the treaty, which provide that differences between the two countries will be settled by negotiations—that is a familiar concept in double taxation treaties. The OECD is involved in helping states of the former Soviet Union in double taxation matters. I am pleased to say that the Inland Revenue is involved in the training effort that has been offered by the OECD in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me whether the treaty is discriminatory against other EC countries. He quoted the concerns of Mrs. Scrivener to ensure that member states of the Community should not sign treaties that are discriminatory. The OECD model is designed to avoid discrimination between the contracting parties to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0564">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
treaty—that is the purpose of the double taxation treaty—as between the United Kingdom and other member states of the European Community. It is in the nature of a bilateral treaty between Britain and Ukraine to establish rights and obligations that are unique and would not exist without the treaty. Therefore, to say that the rights and obligations of German or French enterprises 
	<i>vis-à-vis</i> Ukraine are the same as those for United Kingdom enterprises is nonsense. It is the purpose of a treaty to establish a position that did not exist before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our purpose is not to discriminate against other European member states, but to establish a nondiscriminatory framework for trade and investment flows between this country and the treaty partner—in this case, Ukraine. That is, as the hon. Gentleman has recognised, the logic that underlies the negotiation of double taxation treaties. I congratulate him on his warm welcome for this treaty, which extends that principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to see how Mrs. Scrivener's point about discrimination could ever be met under these bilateral arrangements. Although the OECD model is designed to be as balanced and fair as possible, each treaty contains amendments and clauses that are designed to deal with special circumstances pertaining to the relationship between the two contracting parties. As such, they do not address the concerns of third parties. I suppose that it is in the nature of bilateral treaty arrangements that that is the case. Therefore, it follows that Mrs. Scrivener's point will always have some force until the arrangements are discussed between the EC and other nation states, rather than between the individual member states which comprise the EC and other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still unsure about how developed the infrastructure of the Ukrainian economy is, especially on the business and commercial side, and how Ukranine will meet its obligations under the treaty. For example, article 13 refers to capital gains tax. I am not sure how well established capital gains tax is in Ukraine, and what sort of institutions are subject to it. How likely is it in practice that arrangements for dealing with any double taxation issue that might arise between Ukraine and the United Kingdom will be dealt with in this financial year? We seem to be putting in hand arrangements that are designed to have more impact in the future that the present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it does nothing else, the treaty shows the way in which the Government of Ukraine expect to see their country's economy develop. That is, by and large, to be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 10, which deals with the treatment of dividends, follows the OECD model fairly closely. However, the Financial Secretary could not tell us about the present state of share owning in Ukraine, how far popular capitalism—or even unpopular capitalism—has developed there, and how far its institutions reflect in practice the theory set out in the treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which Ukrainians wish to develop their state is clear from the treaty. However, from my reading of the press coverage in Britain, it seems that Ukraine is still in a period of transition. Government ownership continues to underpin much of the economic structure. How does the treaty tackle transition? I believed that it was the intention, through article 11, to deal with joint ventures. I may be mistaken. The treaty should include clauses that cover state ownership and arrangements that will pertain when state
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
ownership slowly devolves to private ownership. How does the treaty tackle the tax treatment of equity or shares that are granted to private citizens at no cost? A method of placing public institutions in the private domain has been to issue shares, not to sell them, as the British Government has done. There is little left to sell but I am sure that the Government will find and sell what there is as part of their deficit reduction drive. The Ukrainian Government give away assets—they are at least examining that possibility. That would place the ownership of capital which has not been paid for, in private hands. The shares will be tradeable between Ukrainian citizens and companies and us. I would have believed that it was in the interests of the Ukrainian and United Kingdom economies to encourage circumstances in which to facilitate British and Ukrainian joint ventures through the treaty. That might involve the purchase of such shares. The tax treatment of that ownership would be covered by the treaty. Yet it is not clear how shares would be valued in any such taxation arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The western world could contribute to the developing economies of eastern Europe by opening its markets and providing capital. Given the way in which the treaty is structured, the provision of capital, at least for Ukraine, will be done through conventional means such as loans and share ownership. I am worried about the transitional period. Arrangements for that period are not clearly set out. We are dealing with what I take to be the stated objective of the Ukrainian Government. I wish them luck. The British Government must have considered transitional arrangements, and the way in which we deal with the tax treatment of income that would be covered by a double taxation treaty for an economy that is in flux. I hope that the Financial Secretary will respond to the point about transitional arrangements and the tax treatment of share ownership in the peculiar circumstances of a changing and rapidly developing Ukrainian economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the Ukrainian economy is in transition. The responsibility for that rests properly with the Ukrainian Government who have made clear their desire to import market disciplines into their economy and to ensure that Ukraine can participate in the trading system that pertains elsewhere in Europe. As the hon. Gentleman and I have stressed, the treaty, though not the whole transition, plays an important part in the process of transition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the taxation regime for new capital provision as part of that transition, and was principally concerned with equities. They give rise to two sorts of taxable return: capital gain and income. The income provisions—as divided or otherwise expressed—of the treaty set out clearly what will apply on the income side of the account. The capital gains article makes clear that in most circumstances the capital gain is taxed in Ukraine if it is a Ukrainian enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about dealing with base value for a share that is given away as part of a privatisation process. That is a matter for the Ukrainian fisc and not for us. The terms of the treaty set out clearly the circumstances in which capital gains will be taxed in Ukraine. It is for the Ukrainians to decide how to exercise that right within their domestic jurisdiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Regarding assistance in transition, I refer the hon. Gentleman to my earlier points about the provision in the treaty for the taxation of interest and royalty flows. We have departed from the OECD norm in not applying a withholding tax regime to interest and royalty flows. I also refer the hon. Gentleman to the terms of the treaty that exempt United Kingdom inward investment from the rules that do not correspond to western accounting practice regarding the tax deductibility of salaries and interest on long-term debt. Both—particularly the first—were designed specifically to assist the flow of capital and expertise into the Ukrainian economy to promote development. Expertise is just as important as capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that will convince the hon. Gentleman of our desire to assist the process of transition. However, we do not try to interfere in the legitimate concerns of the Ukrainian Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Ukraine) Order 1993.</p></blockquote></p>

	<div class='legislation'>Draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (India) Order 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>11.13 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (India) Order 1993.</p></blockquote>
The Ukrainian economy is a new economy, which we are trying to integrate into the free world economy. The Indian economy is much more familiar to all members of the Committee. It is a major industrial economy, which the Indian Government have been trying for years to integrate more closely into the world economy than was the tradition established by Nehru after independence. I welcome that development. It is in the interests of the residents of India. It is also in the interests of the rest of the world for India to be a major trading partner and home for foreign investment and for investment flows to be encouraged in both directions. I welcome the move that the treaty represents on the part of the Indian Government to apply more standard OECD-type terms to their bilateral economic relations with the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The convention introduces three major changes compared with the convention that it replaces and which was signed in 1981. First, the new convention ends the arbitrary discrimination in which income flows generated by pre-1981 investments did not benefit from reduced treaty witholding rates. Secondly, witholding rates on royalties and technical fees are significantly reduced compared with the 1981 position. A slightly complex article provides for that in the treaty, and the rates are down to 20 per cent., 15 per cent. and, in some categories, 10 per cent. compared with the 30 per cent. across the board that was provided for in the 1981 convention. Thirdly, the shipping article now conforms to the OECD model whereas the 1981 provision granted India, for a 10-year period, taxing rights which would, following rules, have belonged to the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
For obvious reasons, the shipping article need not detain us long when we are discussing our relationship with Ukraine: it is more important in the context of our relations with India. However, they are three important changes which reflect the wider drive of Indian policy to integrate the Indian economy more closely in the world trading system. I commend the treaty to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The shipping article may not have detained the Minister long when he discussed matters relating to the Ukrainian double taxation treaty, but it is included in that treaty and the article deals with air transport, too. The treaty with India contains separate sections for air transport and shipping. Therefore, the Government or their officials spent longer discussing shipping issues with the Government of India. The Financial Secretary has explained the background to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other changes to which the Financial Secretary referred are relaxations of the regime in specialist areas. I want to question him not about those matters, because they do not form the main thrust of the treaty arrangements, but about article 4, which deals with fiscal domicility and the tax treatment of businessmen. The article sets out in conventional terms the tax treatment of businessmen under orthodox arrangements. I wish to deal with how the agreements that we have made under the double taxation treaty with India would sit alongside domestic tax treatment of foreign businessmen who have non-domicile tax status. That subject especially intrigues Labour Members because, as has been widely reported in the popular press, businessmen with such status—there are 4,500 in the country—donated £17 million to the Conservative party before the previous general election. Our affairs are paralleling India in more ways than one. The Inland Revenue is conducting an assessment of non-domicile status arrangements. Will the Financial Secretary tell us how far that assessment has progressed and how the Revenue's current thinking on such matters has conditioned the framing of the double taxation treaty?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Otherwise, the treaty is unexceptional. At least, I could not find anything exceptional in it, but if I had to I could try as it is always possible with matters of this kind. However, it gives us an opportunity to raise matters of serious concern about the arrangements, the main thrust of which is tax avoidance, that business people, often from the Asian sub-continent, enter into in this country. I suspect that taxation is avoided in India and in other Asian countries as well as in this country. That cannot be fair. A person who has an income should make a payment to at least one Government of a nation state. As I said in the discussion of the previous treaty arrangements, I am worried about tax avoidance. We should not put into effect arrangements that encourage and facilitate that. I do not believe in onerous or unduly burdensome rates of tax, but everybody—especially those most able to—should make some contribution to the revenue of a nation state, whether it be the United Kingdom or India.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Financial Secretary can reassure me on that important and disturbing matter, especially as the suggestion is that the domestic relaxations in tax law somehow are linked to substantial sums of money that are donated directly to the Conservative party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms. Angela Eagle 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a slightly esoteric and technical question on the treaty. When considering the trade between the United Kingdom and the Indian sub-continent, especially in goods such as textiles, to what extent have the Government borne in mind some of the revelations about child labour? Such labour is especially common in the process of carpet making. To what extent does the Financial Secretary consider that such matters should be taken into account in dealing with taxation and general trade—issues between the two nations? It is clear from the evidence that there are serious abuses of human rights in some sections of manufacturing and that children are being bought and sold into slavery to produce goods extremely cheaply. No one in this country would want to compete with goods manufactured on that basis. I hope that the Financial Secretary will give the Government's views on the way in which such important and serious matters should be treated in a discussion of trade with countries where such practices obtain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Hodge Hill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one question for the Financial Secretary. Does the double taxation relief have any effect on the income and profit generated by the oil rigs located off the Indian coast that have come under the ownership of the Export Credits Guarantee Department?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.23 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The treaty affects both the terms of loans made by the ECGD and the tax residence of oil service companies. It provides that, in future, companies servicing offshore oil industries around the Indian sub-continent will be taxed by the Government of India rather than by the resident state of the company owning the asset. The ECGD point in the treaty is rather different, and relates to the tax deductability of interest on loans guaranteed by the ECGD. It is not related directly to the oil rig case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the Minister is receiving his brief, may I note that the rigs are owned by the ECGD, which repossessed them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the ECGD effectively has become an oil rig operating company, the taxation of the profits generated by the service activity on the Indian continental shelf would, under the treaty, be claimed by India rather than by the United Kingdom. If it has not and simply acts as a financier, which seems more likely, it would be treated under the interest article.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary is not aware that the taxpayer owns the oil rigs, but that was discussed at the Public Accounts Committee yesterday and is in the newspapers. I appreciate that the Financial Secretary, as is customary, was not present at that meeting of the Public Accounts Committee, but he should know about the scandal that has already cost us £41 million. Will the double taxation relief mean that it will take even longer to reduce that loss? That is a technical question. If the Financial Secretary cannot answer now, perhaps he will write to us later. All members of the Committee will be interested in that appalling scandal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will gladly write to all members of the Committee about the interrelationship, in so far as it exists, between the treaty and ECGD and its adventure with oil rigs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms. Eagle) raised an issue that is more relevant to trade policy or human rights policy than to double taxation. It is a familiar issue. It is sometimes argued that human rights abuses by a trading partner provide a case for restraint of trade. I do not accept that argument. I do not condone human rights abuses but they should be tackled by local jurisdiction. Trading policy is an extremely blunt instrument for dealing with such a focused anxiety. Trade policy is blunt but the taxation system is even blunter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We form a view about the regime with which we deal when we engage in double taxation negotiations, but our purpose is to facilitate a fair taxation of profits between the two countries that sign the treaty. It would be a mistake to believe that we can solve through the taxation system, every bilateral issue that arises between the two countries. The hon. Lady raised a legitimate anxiety. However, it cannot be properly tackled in the context of a double taxation treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East asked about the future of the law of domicile and the law of residence. The law of domicile is not a concept in tax law. The Inland Revenue is not conducting a review of the effect of the law of domicile on the tax system. The Government, under the leadership of the Lord Chancellor, have been reviewing the law of domicile and the law of residence. However, the effects on the tax system of any changes would be a result of a change in the general law concept. It is not a process that is led by the Inland Revenue. The law of domicile and the law of residence have important effects that extend beyond the tax system. It would be wrong for such issues to be led by tax considerations. To my knowledge, there has been no recent change to the law of domicile. To consider relaxations of the law that are linked to donations is to assume that relaxations have occurred. They have not. The hon. Gentleman's proposition is, therefore, hard to substantiate. A review was announced a long time ago. It is proceeding, but one cannot link relaxations and donations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In about 1986, the Government issued a consultative document on residence in the United Kingdom. It was subtitled, "The Scope of UK Taxation for Individuals".

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
