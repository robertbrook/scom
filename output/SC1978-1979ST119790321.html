	<div class='legislation'>MATERIALS AND ARTICLES IN CONTACT WITH FOOD REGULATIONS 1978</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Peyton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Materials and Articles in Contact with Food Regulations 1978.</p></blockquote>
I do not think I need detain the Committee very long. Nor is it necessary for me to raise any matters of contention between the Opposition and the Government. However, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to confirm one or two points and to answer one or two questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These regulations implement the EEC directive adopted in 1976. First, I offer my congratulations to the Government on not having been too precipitate in handling the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I should like confirmation that this instrument adds nothing, in terms of its effect on British industry, to the Food and Drugs Act 1955 and that identical regulations apply in all other Community countries. Thirdly, what evidence is there that the public is subject to any hazard in this regard?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Study of the instrument, particularly the penalty clause, shows that a breach of the regulation shall be punishable, on conviction, with
	<br><blockquote><p>"a fine not exceeding £200 and in any other case to a fine not exceeding £400,"</p></blockquote>
which leads me to believe that authority does not take a serious view of any breach of the regulations. If that is so, we are going through rather complicated machinery to no useful purpose. I hope that those in Brussels can be persuaded to resist the temptation, in moments of leisure, to indulge in wholly useless legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish also to raise the matter of enforcement. I believe that the industry has been assured by the Government that the passage of this instrument will not lead to any greater degree of enforcement than before. At a time when the talents of our country are in eclipse, there is one area in which we shine, and that is, in the nitpicking enforcement of regulations the sense of which is not obvious. I hope that
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
the Parliamentary Secretary will reassure us that this is not the signal for a new campaign of rigours to be visited upon industry which already has to cope with quite enough matters of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main reasons for the Opposition's raising this matter today is our concern about what may follow. We are told that there will be specific directives governing particular materials. We wish to know that, before any specific directive is approved, that protection has been shown to be necessary, that the public are exposed to a genuine hazard, and exactly what that hazard is. If we cannot obtain satisfaction about that, I give formal notice now to the Parliamentary Secretary that the Opposition will oppose any further steps in that direction. We believe that there is a heavy onus on those who make laws. Merely to protect the public from a menace or a hazard that exists only in the imagination is not acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will undertake to pass on those views to those in Brussels who may not be the most avid readers of our 
	<i>Official Report.</i> I am particularly concerned with the anxieties felt by the plastics industry both about the costs of testing materials—I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary has been advised of that—and also about the consequences on the industry's employment figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I need say much about this document. Without being particularly attractive, it is at least intelligible. It has the usual Explanatory Note which explains nothing but merely repeats what is in the text. That is just one of those endearing customs from which we have suffered here for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly curious to know, with reference to the exemptions mentioned in regulation 3
	<i>(d),</i> what makes
	<br><blockquote><p>"any material or article which is a collector's piece of artistic, archaeological or ethnographic interest or … any other material or article of an age exceeding 100 years"</p></blockquote>
exempt from the provisions. Why 100 years? That seems a peculiar provision to put into a regulation. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary has a lucid explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision in regulation 4(2)(ii) seems to be the key:
	<br><blockquote><p>"bring about a deterioration in the organoleptic characteristics of such food or an unacceptable change in its nature, substance or quality."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary does not have much knowledge of this matter, any more than I have myself. We should like to know from those in Brussels what unacceptable changes, in what kind of food, have been brought about by what kind of packaging. Until they can give such explanations, they must understand that we shall look with growing suspicion upon regulations that we regard as tiresome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I need to worry the Committee with any other provisions in the regulations. I may mention regulation 7:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Restriction on use of description 'for food use'."</p></blockquote>
One wonders in what position a retailer, or the editor of a newspaper, would find himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about the obtaining of information under the regulations. Here, I refer to regulation 11, "Confidentiality". The collection of information by authority today needs to be looked at with more and more care. There is a need to ensure that information, even though properly collected, is not improperly used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will inform the Commission that this is not a matter of party controversy. We are all determined to see, in an age where so much legislation is passed—and this place does not set a good example; it turns out a fair mass of often ill-digested legislation—that the already thick flood of legislation is not added to gratuitously and damag-ingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton) for the fair and comprehensive manner in which he approached these regulations. I say at the outset that I share his robust scepticism towards this type of legislation emanating in Brussels. I accept his general attitude that we must ensure that we do not simply allow new laws to be enacted in this country through the Community process for the sake of it. We must be even more vigilant than we are in relation to legislation which originates in the normal domestic processes in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I respond to some of the specific matters raised by the right hon. Gentleman, I should like to make a few introductory
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
remarks about the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of the regulations lies in regulation 4(2), which requires that materials and articles intended for use in contact with food
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practice"</p></blockquote>
and shall not transfer to or leach into food any constituents which would make the food harmful to health, or otherwise unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this is a necessary regulation, because no material can be totally inert. Whenever two items are brought into contact, minute quantities of their constituents are transferred between them. It is important that any leaching will not introduce into food any substances which are hazardous or which will affect its good quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations therefore introduce an important element of consumer protection. But they are also valuable in providing British manufacturers, the vast majority of whom are highly responsible and will experience little difficulty in complying with the regulations, with a framework within which to operate. They also protect those responsible manufacturers from their less scrupulous competitors who may be tempted to sell inferior materials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked what, in practice, we were trying to do. The first point I make is that these regulations are framework regulations. Once they are in effect, we are able, in subsequent decisions, to implement the detailed regulations governing any material or substance where there is a clear risk to human health. There may be dangerous substances in the packaging materials—or cups, cutlery and various other utensils. I shall give an example—not the plastics example, which I shall come to later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take, for example, the work which is being done on vinyl chloride, a constituent of PVC. Work is under way on a directive laying down specific migration limits. That directive has been adopted, and regulations will be introduced later this year. I do not think that there is any argument that it is necessary. It is accepted by the scientific community and by the industry that it is necessary to ensure that there is no risk from vinyl chloride to the food that we eat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are undoubtedly instances where it is right to make subordinate regulations which will stem from these parent regulations. It is the case that in some other
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
member States there are already some regulations controlling some individual substances. Had we not been in the Community, I think we would have found it necessary to take action in relation to some of the substances and materials which come into contact with food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real issue is to ensure that, having obtained these parent regulations, we are not brow-beaten or induced into accepting subsequent requirements and impositions on our industry which cannot be justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ellis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand my hon. Friend to be saying that this regulation gives the Minister power to intervene and to say "You are using a container or substance for food that is likely to be damaging, and you should stop using it or it will be an offence"? Is it the position that we need this regulation for the first time in order to be able to say that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is true, is the Minister saying that if I market a product which poisons everyone because I put it in the wrong container, there is no existing legislation to take me to the cleaners?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Broadly speaking, that is the position. Subsequent regulations will be made. The food and drugs authorities, which in England are the London boroughs and the counties, and in Scotland are the regional and island authorities, will have responsibility for enforcing the subsequent regulations which are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend fairly asked whether we really had no protection in this context. The answer is that we already have some protection in that it is an offence to sell food which is contaminated, or which contains, for example, arsenic chloride above the prescribed level. We are therefore protected to that degree. But we are not protected in relation to the materials included in cups, for example, and other household equipment which we know will come into contact with food. In the case of vinyl chloride, there is a risk of the substance coming into contact with food and the resulting migration taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although up to now we have had the protection under our food and drugs legislation, it is, in our view, necessary to go that stage further where evidence shows that particular compounds in materials which come into contact with food, whether in the home or elsewhere, can pose a real risk to health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ellis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend saying that if I buy a cup and pour in a hot substance which causes a change in the surface of the cup and I am poisoned, there is no redress against the seller of this dangerous or lethal cup?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is that legislation, as it stands, is inadequate to give our people proper protection in that context. We need legislation—which I hope will be used infrequently, because these articles are manufactured by fairly large manufacturers—that enables us to make successful prosecutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt a case for carrying such protection directly to the materials that come into contact with food. That is the issue here. Until now, all legislation has been related only to food. I therefore support this measure—perhaps here I can answer some of the points made by the right hon. Member for Yeovil—and that is why I do not believe that this is an instance of new harmonisation in the Community for its own sake. It makes sense to lay down criteria for maximum amounts of substances that can be incorporated in a material that will come into contact with food. It makes sense to apply that on as wide an international basis as possible, starting with the Community. The Community must then work in contact with the United States and with the international authorities sponsored by the UN. Given that we see the need for these additional controls, it makes sense to apply them in a Community context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must, to be fair, also acknowledge that part of the Commission's motivation in putting the regulations forward is that some member States already have national regulations of this kind. The idea is to apply Community regulations to replace the national regulations in order to remove what are in effect non-tariff barriers to trade within the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Yeovil referred to the 100 years provision in regulation 3. That is simply a means of excluding antiques, and I understand that that is the definition already accepted by Customs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The penalties mentioned are the maximum allowable under the European Communities Act, which is the parent Act for the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked, very fairly, whether all the other member States had implemented the directive.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
The final date for implementation is 26 November 1979. With a matter of this nature, I think that the right hon. Gentleman would be the first to agree that, when a directive has been agreed in Brussels after much consultation with industries throughout the Community and with the national Governments, it is important to have an appropriate period when there can be real consultation with British industry, before we draw up regulations of our own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is general support for the regulations. There is no doubt about that. However, the right hon. Gentleman is right in saying that there is a real concern in the plastics industry. I shall touch on that later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peyton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not so much concerned with the date when the regulations come into force. What worries me is whether every other country will have an identical set of regulations, literally based on the same definition of antiques, and all the rest of it, as we have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matter that always worries me concerns enforcement. We are particularly good—rather too good, in fact—at making the crosses of the t's and the dots of the i's in legislation, and we can make a nonsense with an enforcement of it that even its framers had not contemplated. I am worried that enforcement here may be a great deal more rigid than in other countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to say that all member States to date have implemented the directive, with the exception of Ireland. It makes sense to allow national Governments to implement a directive in the way they see fit. A Community directive is agreed in writing. The member Governments then formulate regulations appropriate to their own situations. If those regulations are not consistent with what has been agreed at Community level—that is, the directive—it is up to the member State to raise the matter with the Commission. The regulations will not be identical in each country, but they will fulfil the objectives and ingredients enshrined in the directive, preventing manufacturers selling materials either at home or in the Community that do not comply with the criteria agreed by the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter of enforcement was raised by the right hon. Member for Yeovil. In a
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
recent debate in the House—when the right hon. Gentleman was not present and the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) led for the Opposition—regarding regulations on slaughterhouses, we made substantial modifications, but, as the regulations were severe, we instructed those involved to be as flexible as possible in carrying them out. That is not wholly satisfactory. The regulations should be explicit. However, common sense must prevail. In the end, we are dependent on local government, which is the enforcing authority, whose elected members have to ensure that no manufacturer is being treated unreasonably in the implementation of the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peyton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious of an increasing tide of complaint regarding enforcement. Most of those called upon to enforce the regulations do so in a reasonable manner, following the spirit of the regulations. They do not go too far, as they understand the limitations of people trying to run businesses. But others, given a little power, appear to take pleasure from making tiresome interventions that serve no useful purpose but which are disruptive and time-wasting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the point has been made. We are discussing these regulations, and not the general enforcement of all regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that is fair. We are in danger of starting a discussion about the extent to which the nation consists of bloody-minded people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the elaboration directives put forward by the Commission in the context of these proposals is that relating to plastics. The Commission's proposals for an overall migration limit on plastics is intended to become a specific directive. It has come before the Council only recently, where it is still being examined by officials. The Scrutiny Committee has recommended that the House examine this proposal, and I expect the debate to take place shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise to the right hon. Gentleman that we are aware of the concern that exists among United Kingdom industries regarding that directive, and we share that concern. As the matter will be dealt with in the debate on that directive, I hope the right hon. Gentleman will leave the matter there. The Government will not be party to the imposition of a requirement which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
cannot be justified on the available scientific evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend make it clear whether these regulations will apply to materials which were not intended at the time of manufacture to come into contact with food, but which subsequently do so? I have looked closely at regulation 4 (1). It states clearly that it refers to material
	<br><blockquote><p>"intended to come into contact with food"</p></blockquote>
or already in contact with food and "intended for that purpose". There is a widespread use of newspaper for wrapping—not only fish and chips, but greengroceries such as cabbages, cauliflowers, and so on. Newspaper was clearly not intended, at the time of manufacture, to come into contact with food.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that. It is important, and it is worth making the position absolutely clear. The regulation covers only materials
	<br><blockquote><p>"intended to come into contact with food."</p></blockquote>
To illustrate that, let us take as an example a company manufacturing tin cans which contain a substance that is above the limit prescribed in a subsequent regulation. In order to prosecute that manufacturer, it will have to be shown that those tin cans were intended to hold food. Clearly, if it is established that the cans were supplied to a particular food processer, obviously there is a clear intent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the situation described by my hon. Friend—which is very commonplace—where a piece of material is brought into contact
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
with food, but without intent, is not in any way covered by these regulations. As my hon. Friend implied, it would be a nonsense if that state of affairs were allowed to develop. So, although it has been thought right to take this enforcement process a stage further back than that described earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Scunthorpe (Mr. Ellis)—namely to apply the regulations to some of the materials which come into contact with food in addition to the foods themselves—there is no question of our getting into the sort of difficulties suggested by my hon. Friend.

I hope that I have adequately covered the matters raised in this brief debate. If I have missed any, I shall be happy to write to any hon. Gentleman who wishes to raise any particular matter. There is a general consensus in the Committee. The right hon. Member for Yeovil has not had the support of many of his colleagues in this debate, but I think that the view is widespread throughout the House that we must ensure that any subsequent directive brought forward by the Commission in order to implement these proposals is wholly justified. That was the burden of the right hon. Gentleman's remarks. I am happy to give him that assurance, and I hope that on that basis we can agree these regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
