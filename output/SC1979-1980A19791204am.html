	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Reginald Eyre)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In accordance with the notice that I gave at our previous sitting, I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the further proceedings on the Companies Bill [
	<i>Lords</i>] the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I mention what has crossed my mind as a possible pattern of business. If by chance the Committee should conclude its consideration of new clause 37 during the afternoon sitting today, it might be considered an advantage if I then moved to adjourn, because the next clause to be considered would be new clause 42—the insider dealing clause—and the Committee would then be in a position to make a fresh start on that clause on Thursday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition had, in fact, made that request to the Government, and I am pleased that the Government have agreed. It may seem odd that the Opposition should seek to facilitate Government business in this way, but we feel that we should proceed with the Committee stage as rapidly as possible so that we can have a suitable opportunity to consult about the new clauses which have been tabled, and we cannot do that effectively while we have so much work in the Committee to undertake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the Government will readily respond to our plea that there should he as long a period as is reasonably possible between the end of the Committee stage and Report. All Members on the Committee need that time to consult widely. It is not only the prerogative of the Government to do that; it is the right of every member of the Committee, and certainly the right of the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are pleased that the Government have done their best to facilitate their own business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>

	<div class='title'>EXCEPTIONS FROM S. (PROHIBITION OF LOANS ETC. TO DIRECTORS AND CONNECTED PERSONS)</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>"(1) Where a director of a relevant company or of its holding company is associated with a subsidiary of either of those companies, sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of subsections (1)(
	<i>b</i>) of section (Prohibition of loans etc. to directors and connected persons) above shall not by reason only of that fact prohibit the relevant company from—

	<ol>

	<li>making a loan or quasi-loan to that subsidiary; or</li>

	<li>entering into a guarantee or providing any security in connection with a loan or quasi-loan made by any person to that subsidiary.</li></ol></p>

	<p>(2) Subsection (2) of that section shall not prohibit a company's entering into—

	<ol>

	<li>any transaction for any person if the aggregate of the relevant amounts does not exceed £5,000; or</li>

	<li>any transaction for any person if—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>the company enters into the transaction in the ordinary course of its business; and</li>

	<li>the value of the transaction is not greater, and the terms on which it is entered into, are no more favourable to the person for whom the transaction is entered into than it is reasonable to expect the company to have offered for a person of the same financial standing as that person (any connection between the company and that person being disregarded).</li></ol></ol></p>

	<p>(3) Subject to the following provisions of this section, each of the following is excepted from the prohibitions in section (Prohibition of loans etc. to directors and connected persons) above, that is to say—

	<ol>

	<li>a loan or quasi-loan by a company to its holding company or a company's entering into a guarantee or providing any security in connection with a loan or quasi-loan made by any person to its holding company;</li>

	<li>a company's entering into a credit transaction as creditor for its holding company or entering into a guarantee or providing any security in connection with any credit transaction made by any other person for its holding company;</li>

	<li>a company's doing anything to provide any of its directors with funds to meet expenditure incurred or to be incurred by him for the purposes of the company or for the purpose of enabling him properly to perform his duties as an officer of the company or a company's doing anything to enable any of its directors to avoid incurring such expenditure;</li>

	<li>a loan or quasi-loan made by a money-lending company to any person or a money-lending company's entering into a guarantee in connection with any other loan or quasi-loan.</li></ol></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0254">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>461</span>

	<p>(4) The exception specified in subsection (3)(
	<i>c</i>) above operates only if one of the following conditions is satisfied, that is to say

	<ol>

	<li>the thing in question is done with the prior approval of the company given at a general meeting at which the purpose of the expenditure incurred or to be incurred or which would otherwise be incurred by the director and the amount of the funds to be provided by the company and the extent of the company's liability under any transaction which is, or is connected with, that thing are disclosed;</li>

	<li>that thing is done on condition that, if the approval of the company is not so given at or before the next following annual general meeting, the loan shall he repaid or any other liability arising under any such transaction discharged within six months from the conclusion of that meeting; </li></ol>
but that exception does not authorise a relevant company to enter into any transaction if the aggregate of the relevant amounts exceeds £l0,000.</p>

	<p>(5) The exception specified in subsection (3)(
	<i>d</i>) above operates only if both the following conditions are satisfied, that is to say—

	<ol>

	<li>the loan or quasi-loan in question is made by the company or it enters into the guarantee in the ordinary course of the company's business; and</li>

	<li>the amount of the loan or quasi-loan or the amount guaranteed is not greater, and the terms of the loan. quasi-loan or guarantee are not more favourable. in the case of the person to whom the loan or quasi-loan is made or in respect of whom the guarantee k entered into than that or those which it is reasonable to expect that company to have offered to or in respect of a person of the same financial standing as that person (any connection between the company and that person being disregarded);</li></ol>
but that exception does not authorise a relevant company which is not recognised as a hank for the purposes of the Banking Act 1979 to enter into any transaction if the aggregate of the relevant amounts exceeds £50,000.</p>

	<p>For the purposes of this subsection a company which a director does not control is not connected with him.</p>

	<p>(6) The condition specified in subsection (5)(
	<i>b</i>) above shall not of itself prevent a company from making a loan to one of its directors or a director of its holding company—

	<ol>

	<li>for the purpose of facilitating the purchase, for use as that director's only or main residence, of the whole or part of any dwelling-house together with any land to be occupied and enjoyed therewith;</li>

	<li>for the purpose of improving a dwelling-house or part of a dwelling-house so used or any land occupied and enjoyed therewith;</li>

	<li>in substitution for any loan made by any person and falling within paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) or (
	<i>b</i>) above,</li></ol>
if loans of that description are ordinarily made by the company to its employees and on terms no less favourable than those on which the
	<span class='label label-info column'>462</span>
transaction in question is made, and the aggregate of the relevant amounts does not exceed £50,000.".—[

	<i>Question proposed</i> [
	<i>29 November</i>], That the clause be read a Second time.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are considering at the same time amendment (a) to the new clause, in the name of the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), in subsection (6), at beginning, leave out:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The condition specified in subsection (5) (
	<i>b</i>) above shall not of itself" and insert:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in this section shall".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee must have had a restless weekend wondering what I intended to say next—a feeling that I share. I was reflecting on some of my anxieties about new clause 24, and I said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"if a director requires a house to perform his duties adequately"</p></blockquote>
in his capacity as a director
	<br><blockquote><p>"as has been said in previous debates, the usual course of events is for the company to purchase the house and then rent it to him on such terms as may be set out in his contract of employment."— [
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 29 November 1979; c. 454.]</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that the subsection enables companies to make loans of the character we are now contemplating even if it is not in the ordinary course of the company's business to make loans as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gather that that is not the Minister's view, though it is for him to express his own opinion on the situation. I understood that his Department considered that only a company caught by the previous subsections was being dealt with in subsection (6) as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not at all sure that that is right. It seems to me that subsection (6) can he read disjunctively from the other subsections. The subsection resembles, but is not identical to, the one that we introduced in our Bill, and I am always delighted to learn that the Government place the highest possible credentials on their clauses when they are identical to ours—that is absolutely right—but we have all had cause to reflect further, and there is no reason why we should not express some doubts about these provisions at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>463</span>
Furthermore, the criteria on which a loan can be made are very vague and difficult to define. I have taken up my point from our previous debate. I think that directors could easily assert that they needed a house of a particular type and character, apposite to their station in life, their entertaining and so on. Therefore, it would be easy to abuse the purposes for which the subsection is designed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, a company could authorise house loans under subsection (6) without obtaining prior approval from the company in general meeting. Nor would it appear to be subject, for the reason that I have already expressed about it being read disjunctively, to the other provisos in subsection (4).Will the Minister say why that is the case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no requirement other than the vague proviso in subsection (6) as to the terms of the loan which may be granted. Is that not an omission which should be rectified? The proviso in the closing lines allows any company to make a loan to, directors to enable them to buy a house or improve a house if, in the ordinary course of events, loans may be made by the company to employees, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 190 of the 1948 Act does not allow loans to be made to directors merely because loans may be made to employees. There is a good reason for that. Directors occupy a fiduciary relationship and they are expected to apply their minds objectively to the considerations which come before them. That is why successive Governments have endeavoured to restrain actions where some conflict concerning that form of fiduciary duty might arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While directors can take an objective view on whether it is right to make advantageous preferential loans to employees, can they really do so when it comes to themselves and when they are, in other words, the beneficiaries in that situation? Can they, because they are beneficiaries, take a wholly objective view, as they should do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are considerable problems in determining whether a loan is a proper one in all the circumstances. I have a sneaking doubt that this situation could be the father and mother of all kinds of abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to one or two other criticisms of perhaps a less fundamental
	<span class='label label-info column'>464</span>
kind which have been made by the Law Society, and I hope that the Minister will be able to deal with them. First, one wonders whether the word "for" in the opening words of subsection (2(
	<i>b</i>) should read "to", because if it is meant in the sense which it appears to acquire in new clause 36(5), its use seems inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another minor point relates to subsection (4), where the word "amount" should read "amounts". In relation to subsection (5), the closing passage, it is strange that the definition should be imported there when there is already a definition of a recognised bank in new clause 36(1). In addition, could the Minister spell out the meaning of the following words at the end of subsection (5)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this subsection a company which a director does not control is not connected with him."</p></blockquote>
That seems a rather odd form of draftsmanship, and perhaps the Minister could throw some light on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (6) enables a moneylending company to make a loan to one of its directors, and there is reference to the condition set out in subsection (5)(
	<i>b</i>). Is it intended that this relaxation should apply only to a loan made to one director, thereby excluding subsequent loans to other directors? I cannot imagine that that is the Government's intention, but that is how the subsection might be construed. If that is not the Government's intention, surely the word "only" might be inserted after the word "one". However, it is not a matter of great importance. I think that the Law Society may be wrong about it but I have raised the point so that the Minister may deal with it in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My anxieties about new clause 24 are rather more substantial. I hope that 'the Government will be able to clarify the points that I have raised and allay my anxieties, although I fear that this is yet another occasion on which the proof of the pudding will be in the eating and it will be difficult for the Government to speculate in advance exactly how valuable this reform of the law will be in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to follow the point raised by the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) in the early part of his speech this morning
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>465</span>
regarding the purchase of a dwelling house for a director. In that respect I am also concerned with the drafting and the ultimate interpretation of subsection (6) of new clause 24, to which my amendment applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me lead into it and refer first to subsection (2). In a previous new clause there was a prohibition on loans to directors and connected persons, and in subsection (2) of new clause 24 one of several exemptions is set out. In this instance, the previous section
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not prohibit a company's entering into"—</p></blockquote>
I refer to paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) now—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(
	<i>b</i>) any transaction for any person if—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(i) the company enters into the transaction in the ordinary course of its business; and"—</p></blockquote>
secondly, to summarise subsection (2)(
	<i>b</i>) (ii), if the transaction is not more favourable to the person for whose benefit it is made than the terms which the company would offer to any other person of the same financial standing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I read it, it does not appear that for most companies that includes the provision of a dwelling-house or a loan for the purpose of purchasing a dwelling-house. One cannot say that it is in the ordinary course of business for many companies to do that, and it may be difficult to say that the director is not receiving preferential treatment—perhaps being lent a little more money than the company might lend to anyone else. Therefore I do not think that loans for purchase of dwelling-houses for directors is covered by that subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to subsection (3)(
	<i>d</i>), which states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a loan or quasi-loan made by a moneylending company to any person or a moneylending company's entering into a guarantee in connection with any other loan or quasi-loan"</p></blockquote>
is not to be prohibited. But that deals entirely with moneylending companies, companies whose normal course of business is to lend money. That is a narrow exception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I then turn to subsection (5), which refers to that exception given to moneylending companies. It begins by saying
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"The exception specified in subsection (3)(
	<i>d</i>) above"—that is, the moneylending company exception—
	<span class='label label-info column'>466</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"operates only if …the loan or quasi-loan in question is made by the company"</p></blockquote>
in the ordinary course of business, and is not more favourable than that
	<br><blockquote><p>"which it is reasonable to expect that company to have offered to or in respect of a person of the same financial standing"—disregarding his connection with the company.</p></blockquote>
I stress that that refers only to a modification of subsection (3)(
	<i>d</i>), the moneylending companies provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we pass to subsection (6), which begins with the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"The condition specified in (5)(
	<i>b</i>)."</p></blockquote>
That is the passage to which I have just referred and which is a modification of the exception in Subsection (3)(
	<i>d</i>), the moneylending companies. I therefore take it that subsection (6) refers only to the moneylending company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (6) continues that the condition in subsection 5(
	<i>b</i>)
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not of itself prevent a company from making a loan to one of its directors or a director of its holding company—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(
	<i>a</i>) for the purpose of facilitating the purchase, for use as that director's only or main residence"—</p></blockquote>
of a house or for improving a house. Then there is a limit on the amount of the loan. But as I read subsection (6), it applies entirely to the modification of the moneylending exception in subsection (3)(
	<i>d</i>).Therefore, it does not help the ordinary company wishing to provide money for a director to purchase his own house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To summarise, it seems that the provisions of subsection (6) will permit only moneylending companies to make loans to directors for house purchase. Unlike the hon. Member for Hackney, Central, I should like to make as wide as possible provision for a company to lend money to a director to purchase a dwelling-house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because I think that in many cases it is of great benefit to a company, particularly a company which has branches or departments spread all over the country, or even all over the world, to be able to move its executive directors conveniently from one area to another. That is one good reason. Another is that even if the company does not operate in a number of places, it may obtain an executive director from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>467</span>
another area altogether. It may employ a new director and wish to provide a house for him near the company's place of operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see why it should be permissible for the company to buy a house and let it to the director when it cannot—as I read the new clause—provide a loan to the director to allow him to buy it himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason is that if the director is permitted to buy the house by being given a loan on peculiarity favourable terms, the company itself derives only those peripheral benefits, if they are such. On the other hand, if the company purchases the house and some considerable profit is available later, the company will benefit. If it is done in that way, as I believe most companies do it, one overcomes the likelihood of abuse, which causes me considerable concern. In no way does the right hon. Gentleman's suggestion overcome that possibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see what is at the back of the hon. Gentleman's mind. He feels that the director is in a fiduciary capacity and should not benefit from an increase in the value of the asset when the money has been provided by the company. The company should benefit from the increase in value of the asset rather than the director.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it is a false conception that a single director is in a fiduciary capacity quite in the way which the hon. Gentleman has described. The board of directors is certainly in a fiduciary capacity in relation to the company and, after all, it is the board of directors who will authorise the loan, if the hon. Gentleman is correct in saying that it would not have to go to a general meeting. It is the members of the board who are the trustees of the company and who will have the duty to see that one of their body does not, out of their provision, make a profit hidden to them. They are making this provision for the benefit of the company so that a director may live where they want him to live.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the right hon. Gentleman is not usually naive, but is he not being naive about this particular matter? One can look at the way in which some members of the board of, for example, Keyser Ullmann
	<span class='label label-info column'>468</span>
behaved: they did not go into general meeting, they did not have board meetings as such. They could hardly be said to have exercised their fiduciary duties properly. Certainly, a number of them enriched themselves, and there was a chain of enrichment. Therefore there was no incentive for one member of the board to take any action to the detriment of another, because he himself was deriving a benefit from the whole chain of enrichment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One would not have to legislate for that body of directors who exercise their fiduciary duties reasonably and properly, as no doubt most of them do. Legislation, as the Minister himself put it—I put it myself earlier—is to deal with those who do not pursue those duties properly, or at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he will forgive my saying so, the trouble with the hon. Gentleman and the serried ranks sitting behind him this morning is that they approach this from the angle of the large company which is swindling the public. I want to get a balance between that and the 99.9 per cent. of other companies that want to run a decent business in an ordinary way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. Gentleman to ponder on this, too. I think that he desires to have employee directors—I hope he does not desire them to be appointed by the trade unions necessarily—working up through a business and accepted because they know the business well, they have worked from the floor upwards and have become directors, having been employees of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If any such person should ever come to me for advice on whether he should scrap his agreement as a general manager and become a director, I would say "Do not touch it with a barge-pole. Look at all the disadvantages you will have. You will be doing exactly the same job as an executive director as you were doing as general manager. Stick at that and remain there".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is a Bill, which will be the Companies Act 1980, which is riddled with great responsibilities on directors. A company can enter into an agreement with its managers, it can provide them with houses, it can lend them money for houses. Why become a director at all? There is a danger that it will be difficult in future to get what I shall call, for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>469</span>
want of a better phrase, the employee director to take on the job of directorship, although he might be very valuable to the company if he did so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see the difference between providing a general manager with a house by means of a loan to him and providing the same thing to an executive director. I agree that it would be outside the fiduciary relationship of the board of directors to the company if it provided a loan to non-executive directors. I am pleading for those directors who are working directors in the company who need to live near their place of business. If I read subsection (6) aright, this clause will prevent the company from helping them unless that company is a moneylending company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further on in the Bill, or perhaps it is in the existing law, we find a definition of a moneylending company which includes any company, I suppose, which does any sort of banking or lending, but not the ordinary commercial or industrial company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may refer to my amendment, although I would not wish to move it at this stage, it seeks to delete the opening words of subsection (6),
	<br><blockquote><p>"The condition specified in subsection (5)(
	<i>b</i>)"—</p></blockquote>
and so on, which seem to tie subsection (6) down to a moneylending company, and to substitute for those tight, narrow words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in this section shall".</p></blockquote>
Then it would read that nothing in this section "shall of itself prevent a company from making a loan to a director for facilitating his purchase of a dwelling-house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that that was the original intention of the clause, and that it was not intended to be restricted to moneylending companies. If it is restricted to a moneylending company, I do not see the purpose of an elaborate clause of this sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Stevens</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish briefly to support the points made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). He referred rightly to company employees resisting invitations to become members of the board because of the added restrictions which we are seeking today to impose upon them. I repeat the point that I made at our last sitting when I suggested that it might be very easy for the kind of directors to whom the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) referred to get round the provisions in the Bill if they are deliberately set upon a course of wrongdoing—that is to say, by acting effectively as directors or controllers of a large company while technically not being members of the board but being employed as consultants or in some other way. In our efforts to control the 1 per cent., are we not going much further than—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman say that it is 1 per cent? Why does he assume that abuse is not capable of being conducted on a much wider basis? Where does he get his statistic from? Is there not overwhelming evidence that in too high a proportion of cases investigated by inspectors the very abuse to which I have been addressing my remarks has occurred over and over again? Should it not be stamped out?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister himself talked about the abuse in the Peachey Property case. He highlighted that abuse and he was right to do so. We are talking about serious losses and activities to the serious detriment of shareholders that are carried out—and in larger companies, of course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My 1 per cent. is not, as the hon. Gentleman says, subject to scientific proof. My evidence, however, for saying that the number of boards of directors who might be described as deliberately set upon a course of wrongdoing is low, is that, apart from having worked as a director of large companies, I have earned my living over the last 10
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>471</span>
years as a management consultant and I have sat in the boardrooms and dealt with the directors of perhaps 150 large companies during that period. It has been my experience that the typical British company director is at least as scrupulous and devoted to the well-being of his company in the way that the Bill desires as are any of the rest of our citizens. But I am perfectly willing to settle for the expression "a minority of companies", if that is preferable to the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our anxiety to catch a minority of wrongdoers, we are making life more difficult and less attractive for the majority of the welldoers. We should not regard the status of company director as so glitteringly attractive as for ever in the future to persuade those who occupy it or hope to occupy it to put up with the mounting pressures and constraints which we are seeking to put upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As one looks around, one sees plenty of professions which have become so burdensome that it is almost impossible to persuade persons of merit to accept positions within them. Running a nationalised industry might be thought to be a case in point. While this issue is relevant to the new clause, as my right hon. Friend has said, it runs through our whole approach to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I add, as a minor point, that here again we mention specific figures. I hope and believe that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will ensure that there are provisions for altering those figures as time goes by, because I am concerned that they will soon cease to be the appropriate figures for the purposes of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we all know that one of the benefits of taking employment in a bank is the availability of mortgages at a considerably lower rate than is available to other members of the public. Am I right that under subsection (5)(
	<i>b</i>) it would be acceptable, if the company so desired, for any company which is not a banking company to offer its employees mortgages at a very low rate but that unless it does so it may not offer a director a mortgage at such a low rate? I should be grateful for my hon. Friend's advice on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is evident that there is a wide difference of opinion among members of the Committee on both sides. In
	<span class='label label-info column'>472</span>
addition to that difference of opinion, a number of technical questions have been raised which bear upon the opinions which have been expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of misunderstandings have arisen on the purpose of the new clause. I hope to clear up some of those misunderstandings, and that will enable me eventually to show that there is also a balancing policy which is provided for in the new clause which takes account of the opinions which have been expressed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish first to tell the Committee that in introducing new clause 24 at our previous sitting I referred to the last sentence of subsection (5) by which we intend to provide that companies will only be connected if the director controls more than half the voting power or owns more than half the share capital. New clause 35 provides that, in general, a company is connected if the director controls more than 20 per cent. of the voting power or owns more than 20 per cent. of the share capital. We have raised the threshold of connection for moneylending companies because of the difficulties for the companies in keeping track of all transactions between them and the much wider number of companies in the "associated" category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Go a bit more slowly, please.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On occasion, the hon. Gentleman chides me for not making progress quickly. I was seeking to please him in that respect, but I shall be glad to slow down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following comments from the Law Society, we find the sentence is defective in that it does not provide for the basic conditions in paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>) of subsection (5)—that loans and so on be made in the ordinary course and on normal commercial terms—to be applied to loans and so on to such associated companies. As drafted, it would enable loans to be made to such companies on any terms. This is clearly undesirable, and we shall bring an amendment forward on Report to correct it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In looking at this sentence, we have come to realise that we have not, as we intended, carried its intentions over to the disclosure clauses for recognised banks—dealt with in clauses to which we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>473</span>
shall come later. We intend that the recognised banks shall not be required to disclose in their annual statement the loans and so on made to companies which the directors do not control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other moneylending companies whose status is less elevated than the recognised banks, and whose lending will be restricted to £50,000 per director and circle of connected persons, including only controlled companies, will, however, disclose loans made to associated companies. Having dealt with that as a preliminary, I refer now to the points raised by the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked why, under new clause 24, we propose to permit a moneylending company to make loans to its directors for the purposes of house purchase if the company ordinarily makes such loans to its employees, when my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer is reviewing the various tax benefits permitted to companies when they purchase items to be used by employees wholly or partly in the course of the companies' business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, let me say that the Government's general view is that such perks should not be encouraged, and that payment by a company in return for its employees' services should, wherever possible, be in wages and salaries, not in kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions of our new clauses are compatible with that approach since they will also encourage companies to pay the proper rate for the functions that their directors perform. But while these clauses deal with the misuse of a company's resources by a director, my right hon. and learned Friend's review of items known as "perks" is looking at the justification for tax benefits on such items—in other words, whether it is right for the nation to forgo the tax contribution that companies would otherwise make in providing for such items for their employees. Our clauses being discussed this morning and elsewhere in the Bill are not concerned with the fairness of the taxation regime but with the ability of directors to divert their shareholders' assets, and therefore I think we must strongly distinguish the two cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the two
	<span class='label label-info column'>474</span>
things are so often integrally connected. It becomes much more difficult for the Chancellor to take action to cure the abuse from a taxation viewpoint if the practice of conferring perks of this kind becomes underlined time and again in corporate practice. Does the Under-Secretary not see the clear relationship between the two?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to explain that there are matters outside the capacity of this Committee to determine which bear upon this question, but for the purpose of discussion within the Committee I am trying to emphasise the prime importance of our consideration of those matters which affect companies, and to deal particularly with the effect of these measures upon shareholders' assets. We must keep this clearly in mind in our consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the provision of a house purchase loan by a moneylending company to an employee, there is, first of all, no tax benefit to the company. The tax position of the recipient—I refer to this because of the hon. Gentleman's remarks—is partly the same as that of any other person paying back a mortgage loan for the first £25,000 of such a loan, namely that relief is available at the appropriate rate of tax. But I would remind the hon. Gentleman that the Finance Act 1976 provided that, in the case of a house loan in excess of £25,000 subject to lower than commercial rates of interest, the benefit so conferred on the borrower shall be imputed to his income and taxed at the marginal rate. The position is, therefore, that tax benefits accruing to the recipients of such low interest loans have already been reduced, so the hon. Gentleman has nothing to worry about in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member may wish to note that the provision on moneylenders' house loans has the same effects as that in the Bill put forward by the previous Administration, even if the wording is very slightly different. It will, as I think he was suggesting it should, have the effect that where a director of a company finds that a larger house is necessary for carrying out his functions as a director more effectively, the company should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>475</span>
in those circumstances purchase a house and rent it to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a lease ought to be considered as a credit transaction in the terms of this part of the Bill, and it would be illegal unless entered into in the ordinary course of business and on ordinary terms. Such a transaction would also be disclosed under the terms of clause 28.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hackney, Central also queried whether it would be difficult to establish, as a matter of evidence, that a credit transaction had been made contrary to the conditions laid down in subsection 2(
	<i>b</i>) of new clause 24. Subsection (2)(
	<i>b</i>) lays down a two-part test of eligibility for making a credit transaction in favour of a director or connected person, the first being that the item being sold must be shown to be part of the company's existing or forthcoming product range or an ancillary item. For example, the leasing of expensive hi-fi equipment by a company making, for instance, bricks would clearly be prohibited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will obviously be marginal cases, but the second limb of the test in the subsection must also be passed. If the amount involved in the transaction is unprecedented in the company's ordinary business, or even very exceptional, that in itself will be enough to show that the exception does not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, the value of a credit transaction is defined in new clause 36 (3) as the price which it is reasonable to expect could be obtained for the item concerned if it had been supplied at the same time in the ordinary course of business and on the same terms—apart from price—as it has been supplied to the director. This provision ensures that any artificially low price, which may have been agreed between the director and his company in order to make the transaction appear regular, will be ignored. At the same time, the terms will be examined to ascertain whether the rate of interest is a normal commercial one and whether the period of credit is longer than the normal commercial period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances that I have described, I hope that the hon. Member for Hackney, Central will agree that the test in subsection (2)(
	<i>b</i>) is sufficiently robust to prevent undue advantage being taken of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall turn now to a number of
	<span class='label label-info column'>476</span>
smaller points, particularly on drafting, made by the hon. Member for Hackney, Central. Subsection (2)(
	<i>b</i>) does not permit a company to make house purchase loans loans if the lending is not in the ordinary course of its business. This a major point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby and I shall return to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hackney, Central, inquired as to the effect of subsection (6) in relation to one requirement in paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) of subsection (5). Paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) of subsection (5) still applies to a transaction of the kind described in subsection (6). The hon. Member also asked why no approval is given. The provision is subject to the controls of the clause itself, and I think he will, on consideration, realise that these are stringent. We do not apply new clause 22 to cash transactions, but it should be noticed that there are criminal sanctions here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member also asked why there are no requirements as to the terms. It is correct that there is no requirement corresponding to subsection (5)(
	<i>b</i>). I thought that I should make that clear to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not follow that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I relate it to a point made by the hon. Gentleman. Perhaps when he can look at it in detail he will find that it does answer his query.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised some more drafting points. One concerned the word "for" in subsection (2)(
	<i>b</i>)(ii). He asked why we did not use the word "to". This is quite deliberate. We wish to import the definition in clause 36.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The word "for" is used no fewer than four times in that subsection, almost each time with a different meaning. The first reference is to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any transaction for any person"—</p></blockquote>
which I presume means for the benefit of any person. It is not on behalf of him, which it could easily mean. Then the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"any transaction for any person"</p></blockquote>
are used in the opening words of paragraph (
	<i>b</i>). Then in sub-paragraph (
	<i>b</i>)(ii) we find
	<br><blockquote><p>"the person for whom the transaction is entered into".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>477</span>
Again, one might be entering into it as nominee for that person, but it clearly means for the benefit of the person. Finally, there is the one mentioned by the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis),
	<br><blockquote><p>"expect the company to have offered for a person"—</p></blockquote>
which must surely be "to" a person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his observations. I shall ensure that the drafting of the clause is carefully looked at on the basis of all the points raised either by him or the hon. Member for Hackney, Central. I am informed that the word "for" means the same in each case. I know that, like myself, my right hon. Friend will want to consider that point again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even though the Fifth Cavalry brings relief from time to time, as I well know, it too can be wrong. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will look most carefully at this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right in saying that the Fifth Cavalry has on occasion charged for or to the wrong objective. I assure the Committee that the points raised will be carefully studied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the word "amounts" in the closing line of subsection (4). This was a printing error. I am informed that it has been corrected in today's Amendment Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's third point related to the last two lines of subsection (5). I have already given him—not much to his satisfaction, I must admit—the rather technical answer that I received in that respect. But I assure him that we shall look at that technical matter at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's fourth point related to the word "one" applying to "director" in the opening words of subsection (6). I agree with him that the Law Society is not correct on this point. It means "any director". I am advised that the clause, as drafted, achieves the desired result, but I am happy to undertake to consider whether the drafting, not only in this respect but in all the respects raised this morning, can be clarified and improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I turn to the interesting points raised by my right hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>478</span>
Member for Crosby, in which he was supported in some degree by my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham, I want to clear up a matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham with regard to shadow directors. We have already indicated that we shall be bringing forward a further new clause to make these prohibitions apply to de facto directors who are not, however, formally on the board. I hope that my hon. Friend will await the details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my hon. Friend's comment on that, but if the provision is to be valid it must move upwards and downwards. Presumably, it must also cover the example used by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby, of a general manager who performs the duties of a director, having worked his way up through the company, who is offered a seat on the board and declines it. There are a growing number of such people. Perhaps my hon. Friend can confirm that the provisions will be broad enough to cover them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point relating to developments in society which are of concern because in the long run they affect the willingness of people to make industry work successfully. I assure my hon. Friend that we shall take account of that. My hon. Friend also mentioned thresholds and adjustments. Thresholds will be subject to amendment as changed circumstances make appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the principle raised in the amendment to the new clause tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby, in which he is in part supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens). The effect of the amendment is to allow any company, not just a moneylending company, to make loans to its directors for house purchase or improvement as part of a housing scheme available to employees generally. I regret to inform my right hon. Friend that I cannot accept his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the provisions under discussion is to tighten up the existing provisions regulating directors' conduct, which have been abused. My right hon. Friend knows that there is substantial evidence of abuse, and I know that he recognises that we must deal with those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0263">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>479</span>
abuses. That is the purpose of these provisions. Those abuses can be repeated by a small minority of directors who might be tempted to act in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would frustrate our intention to tighten up the law in this area, as it would have the opposite effect. It would considerably relax the existing rules in section 190 of the 1948 Act which, as my right hon. Friend knows and understands, do not allow loans to be made to directors of non-moneylending companies for any purpose, even if they are the type which are made to employees. I emphasise the practical importance of the point that section 190 of the 1948 Act prohibits loans to directors. That has been so since 1948.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The apparently anomalous situation in which moneylending companies—a special category—are allowed to make concessionary house loans to their directors, while other companies are prohibited from so doing, is unavoidable if we are to prevent directors of non-moneylending companies from being in a position to abuse those provisions. I know that my right hon. Friend will bear in mind that, as I said earlier, this provision in particular is aimed at stopping all those abuses of which we disapprove strongly. The clause is unavoidable if we are to prevent directors of non-moneylending companies from being in a position to abuse those provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason why companies whose ordinary business does not include the lending of money should be allowed to divert their funds or limit their borrowing potential in order to provide concessionary housing loans for their directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If directors of ordinary companies were allowed to participate in such housing schemes, small companies in particular which made relatively few such house loans to employees would be in a position to take advantage of concessionary loans to the detriment of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that my right hon. Friend's amendment relates to all companies, including private companies, and not only to public companies that might have more substantial assets. However,
	<span class='label label-info column'>480</span>
in most moneylending companies, as I think my right hon. Friend will appreciate, these housing schemes are well established and the scope for abuse by directors is very much smaller.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should note that our new clauses do not prevent a holding company from making loans to directors of its subsidiary, provided that the directors are not also directors of the holding company, so directors of subsidiaries who may be required by their company to be regionally mobile—I know that this point was in the mind of both my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend—and who, therefore, would be in greater need of housing would still be in a position to receive such loans from the holding company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, companies which may require their employees to move upon promotion to the board may make provision for such an employee under a housing scheme immediately prior to that employee's promotion, as it is that employee's status at the time the arrangement is made that determines the legality of the loan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I hope that my right hon. Friend will appreciate the practical importance of that provision with regard to the senior employee who has the prospect of going on to the board and where provision can be made within the company before he receives that promotion. We believe that the exemption granted by his amendment would be inappropriate and would leave scope for an abuse that we wish to prevent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my right hon. Friend will have regard to the major purpose of this provision, which is to deal with existing abuses which we wish to prevent. In that context, I ask him to accept the reasoning that I have tried to develop in showing why his amendment is not acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand from my hon. Friend that there are two ways of getting round this provision. First and foremost, I had hoped that he would tell the Committee that it was not the intention to stick to section 190 of the 1948 Act as it stands, and that the purpose of the new clause was to allow companies to make loans to directors for the purchase of a dwelling-house. But that is not so, and it is the intention not to allow any company other than a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>481</span>
moneylending company to make such loans to directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prohibition can, however, be got round in the following way. Before a man becomes a director, the loan is made to him and he purchases a dwelling house, perhaps while under a contract of service as a manager to the company. He is then appointed a director, but he is not, as I understand it, obliged to disgorge that loan and sell his house. He can continue to enjoy the loan that he received before becoming a director.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the simple procedure is this. A director resigns his directorship for a week, has a week's contract as a manager, accepts a loan from the company, and buys his house. That is not to say that the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis), the Under-Secretary of State or I, all of whom are in the same profession, think that the conveyancing could be put through in one week. In a fairly short period that person is re-appointed as a director.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are two ways out of the problem, but there is a third way. A person forms a subsidiary company, becomes a director and ceases to be a director of the parent company. He takes the loan from the parent company, and everything is all right. He buys his house and that is that. When he has bought his house, he again becomes a director of the parent company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the proposed new clause to deal with shadow directors—which we have not yet seen and which I tried desperately to understand as my hon. Friend galloped along in a Sebastian Coe style when he was explaining it to us—will catch the director who resigns just so that he can buy his own house on a loan from the company. As things stand at the moment, those are three good ways of getting over the difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I would rather have all this above board—perhaps "board" is the appropriate word. A board of directors should be open about the money being provided for a director to live in a certain dwelling house which he owns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have been talking about the Peachey case so much that my mind goes to that all the time. Indeed, most of the abuses in that case occurred in a roundabout way. If there are to be openings which, if anyone takes advantage of them, will not be known to the shareholders or the public, why not act openly? The shareholders and the public should know about them, because they will be disclosed in the company's accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not feel inclined to ask leave of the Committee to withdraw my amendment. I hope that my hon. Friend will reconsider allowing companies—perhaps a restricted number of companies—to make loans for the purpose of their directors purchasing houses. There is such a demand for that now in the ordinary company that we should consider making it legal without opening the floodgates to deception.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for the attention that he has given to this provision. I tried to explain the anomaly which arises because of the different situation applying to a moneylending company. I hope that my right hon. Friend can accept my explanation that that was an anomalous situation arising out of the history of these cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend went on to point out that an employee, before he becomes a director, will be able to take advantage of a house loan scheme. I agree entirely with that. It appears to be sensible for a senior employee to act in that way. My right hon. Friend is quite correct in saying that that is an exception—although a minor exception—to the main scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend then described two rather imaginative ways in which the rules laid down could be avoided. As he knows, one of the problems of company law is that, however the rules are laid down, attempts can be made to circumvent them, and very often in more disreputable circumstances than those mentioned by my right hon. Friend this morning. In many circumstances, ways can be found round rules. That is why the legislation has been carefully prepared, to try to stop what have been serious and repeated abuses under company law as it

has stood hitherto. I ask my right hon. Friend to keep that requirement in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move now to the more general nature of my right hon. Friend's case. It would not be desirable to extend a concession such as he has in mind to the wide range of thousands of private companies, as the first requirement is that they should make use of their assets in the best possible way on behalf of the company. Directors of those companies would do better to put their energies towards obtaining a mortgage loan from a building society or a bank rather than trying to divert the assets of the company to their own personal use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's view is that the provisions that I have described are justified, because the moneylending companies that account for the anomaly have the resources to deal with those loans, and are in that way of business. That is</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<li>the value of the proposed transaction or arrangement;</li>

	<li>the value of any existing relevant arrangement falling within subsection (3) or (4) of section (Prohibition of loans etc. to directors and connected persons) and entered into by virtue of the relevant exception by the company or by a subsidiary of the company or, where</li></ol></p>

	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 1, Noes 9.</p>

	<p>the proposed transaction or arrangement is to be made for a director of its holding company or a person connected with such a director, by a subsidiary of its holding company;

	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. members will recall that new clause 24 provides for a number of financial limits. The purpose of new clause 25 is to provide a means of determining whether a proposed transaction or arrangement can be made in accordance with these limits. I hope that it will be helpful to the committee if I go through this rather detailed clause first, and then summarise its provisions afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) coins the term "relevant exception" which covers the following financial limits: first, the provision in subsection (2)(
	<i>a</i>) of new clause 24 for the disregard of the first £5,000 worth of credit transactions made by relevant companies to directors and connected persons: secondly, the ability of a relevant company to provide funds to the value of £10,000 per director for the purposes of business expenses by virtue of subsection (3)(
	<i>c</i>) of new clause 24; thirdly, the provision for limits on relevant companies which are moneylending companies—other than recognised banks—of £50,000 on sums made in the ordinary course of business and for house loan schemes to directors and connected persons, and of a separate £50,000 applicable to recognised banks for loans made under their loan scheme to their directors. Both of these limits flow from paragraph (
	<i>d</i>) of subsection (3) of new clause 24.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be noted that each financial limit permits transactions if the aggregate of the relevant amounts does not exceed the specified figure, Subsection (2) therefore describes the amounts that have to be aggregated. Subsection (2) also makes it clear that, where the beneficiary of the proposed transaction or arrangement is the director of a holding company or a person connected with him, the values of, or amounts outstanding under, transactions or arrangements made to such persons by a subsidiary must be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) provides that in the consideration of a proposed transaction
	<span class='label label-info column'>486</span>
and so on existing transactions made not only for the proposed recipient but for others in the same circle of connected persons must be included. Thus, in paragraph (
	<i>a</i>), existing transactions made for a director's connected persons must be included along with those made for the director himself, and, in the circumstances of a transaction being proposed to a connected person, paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) states that the existing transactions made for the director and other connected persons must be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that I am anticipating the discussion of clause 36(3), which will arise under the new clauses on disclosure, but I think that it will help the committee's understanding of this clause if I say that the quantum we have specified as the value for each transaction is intended as a measure of the company's resources tied up in favour of the director or connected person. I think that each quantum is self-explanatory, although hon. Members may wish to note that in the case of credit transactions we have sought to identify the extent of the company's resources by reference to the arm's length value rather than to any artifically low figure that the director and the company may have incorporated into the transaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 25(5) provides for the taking into account of any reduction in liabilities under the basic transactions referred to in subsection (2)(
	<i>c</i>), that is, loans, quasi-loans or credit transactions, and guarantees for security thereon, when they are provided in their basic form—for example, when they are not subject to any assignment to back-to-back deals. It ensures that only the sums actually owing under any existing transactions at the time that the proposed transaction is being considered will be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at the outset, this appears to be a rather complicated clause, but I shall try to sum it up briefly. It requires that for all existing transactions and so on made under each particular financial limit their value in favour of the person to whom a new transaction or arrangement is being contemplated must be aggregated in order to determine whether the new transaction or arrangement can be entered into. Such aggregation includes any transactions and so on made to the other members of a particular director's circle of connected persons, and also any made to the members of such a circle by a subsidiary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, I am apprehensive when I seek to reply to drafting points raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), because I know that he will have given a great deal of attention to a matter of this kind. I also know that he is most diligent in studying the detailed, if very technical, advice which is available to members of the Committee from the Law Society of England, the Law Society of Scotland and other learned bodies which work extremely hard to provide this kind of advice to hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In passing, may I say how grateful we are to the members of the learned bodies and institutions for the tremendous amount of detailed work they do in preparing their advice. It is invaluable, but it also requires a Member of the House, such as my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby, to be prepared to devote himself to the task of understanding the complicated nature of that technical advice when it arrives and relating it to actual provisions contained in rather complicated Bills such as this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason we cannot simplify the drafting of clause (2)(
	<i>b</i>) as my right hon. Friend suggested is that we need all the words. We need to cover all possible existing transactions in subsections 2(
	<i>c</i>) and (3). That is a good basic simple explanation which will convince even the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis). If we left them out there would be a gap. I hope that my right hon. Friend will consider those points carefully. We shall constantly take account of the points that he makes in trying to improve the drafting of this complicated Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have unearthed something by what I thought was merely a drafting criticism. My hon. Friend said "If we have all these words
	<span class='label label-info column'>488</span>
they will catch existing transactions". Does he mean that something which is now in existence will be caught when the Bill becomes an Act, so that the Act will be retrospective? I am not sure that that is not so as the subsection is worded. Subsection (2)(
	<i>b</i>) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any existing relevant arrangement"</p></blockquote>
and subsection (3) states
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this section, a transaction is relevant if it was made …"</p></blockquote>
I suspect that we have here retrospective legislation. I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to assure me to the contrary. I can see some scribbling going on, so if he wishes I just mention that fact and leave it there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I assist my right hon. Friend by explaining that the reference to existing transactions is there because, as he will appreciate, there may be certain existing transactions that have to be aggregated for the purpose of the limits specified in some of these provisions.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To some extent it is restrospective in that it takes into account previous transactions and aggregates them with some new transaction. To that extent it is only semi-retrospective, if I may put it that way, since it is only for the purpose of aggregation. I am still a little doubtful about this, because there is a certain amount of shaking of heads and muttering. Either I am on to a very good point or a very stupid point, and I am not certain which.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help my right hon. Friend if I assure him that the process of aggregation will not apply to existing transactions—that is, transactions which are completed before the arrangements we are discussing come into effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Minister For Trade (Mr. Cecil Parkinson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this clause we state the consequences in civil law of transactions, arrangements and agreements which contravene the prohibitions set out in new clause 23. But before dealing with the effects of the provisions of this clause it may be helpful to hon. Members if I explain the problems which made us feel this particular clause was necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of new clause 23 as it stands is to impose a statutory prohibition on persons entering into certain transactions arrangements and agreements. We discussed that clause at some length. In the absence of express provisions the consequences of a prohibited transaction being entered into and carried out are regulated by rules developed under the general common law. The truth of the matter is that the case law produced by the courts in this field is, however, rather complicated and confusing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Administration sought to deal with this problem by providing detailed rules as to the consequences for a person entering into a prohibited transaction. But to spell out in detail the consequences of entering into the much wider range of prohibited transactions that we are covering in this Bill would add further substantial clauses to our already complex set of provisions. That might be threat enough to the Committee. On the other hand, to do nothing would have required the application of the existing complex body rules on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have therefore decided to resolve the problem by following the approach that they followed in new clause 22. In that clause the recovery of property transferred in breach of the provisions of that clause and to the liabilities of those concerned in the breach—I am sorry, Sir Stephen. It is some time since I have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0269">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>491</span>
taken part in these debates. I have got that bit muddled. I do not wish to mislead the Committee, so perhaps I may say it again in the correct form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have therefore decided that the approach embodied in new clause 22 to the recovery of property transferred in breach of the provisions of that clause and to the liabilities of those concerned in the breach is, with one important difference, equally applicable to consequences of breaches of the prohibitions of new clause 23.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In broad terms, the provisions of new clause 26 ensure that the company will be able to recover property from those into whose hands it passes in contravention of new clause 23 if the conditions set out in subsection (1) can be fulfilled. If it cannot exercise this right, and to the extent that the status quo cannot be fully restored even when the right is exercised, subsection (2) provides a clear right to claim, against those who permitted or procured the breach, in respect of losses suffered and of any profits which accrue to those responsible for the breach. If innocent third parties acquire property or are involved in the transaction without knowledge of the circumstances, they will not suffer any adverse consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may remember that we had a debate on clause 22 in which we set out the Government's approach to the problems caused by those who transgressed. We gave the company the right to recover property, to claim against those who permitted the breach to take place, to be reimbursed for losses and to follow gains through and reacquire them. In this new clause we seek, in providing civil remedies for a breach of new clause 23, to follow the principles we outlined in new clause 22.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that statement somewhat unsatisfactory. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman's long sojourn away from the activities of a Standing Committee have led to it. All he says, in effect, is "We share the objectives set out by the previous Government in their Bill, but we think that those objectives were unsatisfactorily dealt with in the Bill because it was too comprehensive. Therefore we have made our proposals less comprehensive and we think that they are more satisfactory." But that does not establish that the Government are right in their thinking on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>492</span>
I should like the hon. Gentleman to particularise in what respects he felt—we want him to be precise and not to give a mere assertion such as he offered the Committee this morningthat the previous Government failed in their clause 50 to encompass what he is seeking to achieve. What were the deficiencies in that clause, and how are they all taken up satisfactorily in new clause 26? We have heard nothing about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Law Society has made criticisms of the Government's proposals, and I think that it would be more apposite if I returned to those points later and disposed of the issue of principle first. But it is an issue of principle which requires particularisation by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has put forward a most extraordinary argument. He said that the Government owe it to the Committee to justify changing proposals which he made in his previous Bill. I thought that what we were debating was the new clause as proposed by the Government. I said in my opening remarks that the Government have decided that the existing body of case law is complex and confusing. We decided that the proposals we have brought forward, for reasons which I do not need to bore the Committee with, are more consistent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In new clause 22 we set out to outline how we felt certain breaches should be dealt with, and we did so in certain ways. We dealt with the possibility of recovering the property transferred in breach of the provisions, and then, failing that, we set out to deal with the liabilities, losses or gains that might arise for the company from any transaction. We think that our approach is consistent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not being awkward to the hon. Gentleman. I am simply saying that we are now debating this Government's proposal for dealing with a problem which the previous Government and ourselves have both identified. I have explained why we believe that our approach is both sensible and consistent and deserves the support of the Committee. We gain nothing from my going into a long comparison of the difference between clause 50 of the previous Government's Bill, and our new clause 26.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The points which arise on new clause 26 are similar to those which we debated on new clause 22. How
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0270">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>493</span>
is any subsequent dealer with the asset concerned to know that there has been a contravention as described in the new clause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding of the position from subsection (1) is that any transaction which is in contravention of the clause about prohibition of loans to directors and connected persons is voidable, and, indeed, is voidable for ever unless one of three incidents arise. Otherwise, unless one can prove that one of those three things has happened, the transaction may at any time be voidable by the company. The three exceptions are restitution, indemnity, and rights acquired by an innocent third party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Restitution may no longer be possible. Where restitution ends the voidability of the contract, that voidability ends and the contract is validated if restitution is no longer possible. If one is a third party dealing with the property, how will it be possible to prove that, or find out whether restitution is any longer possible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second exception,
	<br><blockquote><p>"or the company has been indemnified in pursuance of subsection (2)(
	<i>b</i>) below for the loss or damage suffered by it"</p></blockquote>
is fairly well explained in subsection (2)(
	<i>b</i>). I suppose that any person subsequently dealing with the property could ask a straight question: "Has there been indemnity under that provision of subsection (2)(
	<i>b</i>)?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third exception when the transaction may be validated and cease to be voidable is where
	<br><blockquote><p>"any rights acquired bona fide for value and without notice of the contravention by any person who is not a party to the arrangement or transaction would be affected by its avoidance."</p></blockquote>
With these provisions on the statute book, there will be great difficulty for any person dealing with property on which there has been a sale by a company. I offered some tentative solutions to this problem when discussing new clause 22, and I hope that they will be considered. If they are considered in connection with new clause 22, I hope that they will be considered in connection with new clause 26 also.

Lest it is thought that the last words of the clause—
	<br><blockquote><p>"at the time that the arrangement or transaction was entered into, he did not know the relevant circumstances constituting the contravention"—</p></blockquote>
dispose of a number of the points I have made, I would point out that those words
	<span class='label label-info column'>494</span>
apply only to the question of repayment by the person who is involved in the transaction—the director or connected person. They do not deal with the difficulties of the person dealing with the property in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The trouble with the Ministers is that they need more words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be obtuse about this, but I consider that the wording of the new clause, in seeking to achieve the objective that is common to both sides, is difficult to follow. The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has made a number of important criticisms. I hope that the Minister will not upbraid me too much for referring to the old clause 50. He seemed sensitive about its being referred to at all, as though history may now be rewritten by the Conservative Party. But clause 50 was an important element of the history of our country. What we sought to do in that clause was to say that a person who contravened the provision dealing with the prohibition of loans to directors had to repay the sum in question immediately, subject to one or two provisos. It seems that the Government are seeking to achieve more or less the same thing but, in fairness, are expressing themselves in a very convoluted way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to reserve my criticisms to some extent to see whether we should table an amendment on Report, but it would help if the hon. Gentleman were to say how he has managed to achieve that common objective in this form of words without getting terribly riled and saying that clause 50 is not what we are debating. The reason for our debate is to try to arrive at a formulation of words that is sensible, comprehensive and achieves a common objective. I do not seek to make party points by going back to the old clause. It merely seems that on balance it achieved rather more effectively what he himself seeks to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman says that that is not so, and that what we are debating is this clause and nothing else, he is taking a very narrow view of the work of the Committee, and I regret that. It may be that I am quite wrong and that he will convince the Committee that he is going down the right course. But I hope that he will be less abrasive in responding to the points I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I say first to my right hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Page) that we accept, as the Law Society has pointed out, that many of the criticisms applying to clause 22 apply equally to this clause. That is inevitable because we have tried to model our civil remedies in this clause on the lines of those proposed in new clause 22. Therefore we accept that the criticisms that could be applied to new clause 22 apply here. We shall seek, as we promised to do at our last sitting, to meet the points suggested by my right hon.

I turn to the comments of the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis). When I lay in bed this morning at about 7 o'clock reading these clauses—which is a very odd way to start the day—I thought that merely by reading them one could see what they meant. In fact in a discussion with an official less than half an hour ago I said that it was a pleasure to read these next new clauses because I could follow them just by reading them through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that there are flaws of the kind that my right hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Hackney, Central have hinted at and we propose to deal with those flaws. But may I reiterate our approach to this problem? Where possible, we would seek to recover the company's property from the person into whose hands it had found its way as a result of the contravention, provided that the conditions of subsection (1) were fulfilled. But if the company cannot restore the status quo—we are talking about civil remedies now—subsection (2) provides for a right to claim against those who committed or procured the breach in respect of losses suffered or any profits which accrue to those responsible for the breach. As I went on to say, innocent third parties are protected in the circumstances set out in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We regard that as a reasonable, sensible and comprehensible way of providing civil remedies for breach of new clause 23. I do not think that we should become
	<span class='label label-info column'>496</span>
bogged down in history. It was Henry Ford who said "History is bunk" and there is no more bunkish history than the Bill that fell in the last Parliament. It never even became history. It was a just a brave attempt to make history which did not succeed. If history is bunk—I am not saying that I agree that it is—that must be as bunkish a bit of history as one could devote any time to. But I am being a little flippant and I am being unkind to the hon. Gentleman, who worked very hard on that Bill, put a great deal of effort into it and was very helpful to those who served on the Committee, evens though he did not serve on it himself because he was involved with another Bill. He sought to meet us and the points that we made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that new clause 26 stands up in its own right as a sensible attempt to deal with the problem. It represents a great deal of further thinking following the last Bill. We believe that, properly amended, as new clause 22 will be amended, it will give a satisfactory civil remedy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that you have noticed, Sir Stephen, that nobody has felt moved to join his name to mine on any new clause. I am beginning to develop a bit of a thing about this, being the only person prepared to be associated with the new clauses. We must do something about that by the time the Committee next sits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause provides the criminal sanctions that the Government believe are necessary where a revelant company enters into transactions and arrangements prohibited under new clause 23. Before I deal with the provisions of the new clause in detail I should like to indicate briefly our approach to criminal penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) said recently, we see the main safeguard against abuse by directors of their position in the company in the disclosure provisions that we shall be turning to next. In addition, as I explained during our debate on new clause 22, we have provided clear civil remedies which, we trust, will enable companies to recover resources illegally transferred to directors or connected persons, while paying due regard to the interests of third parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also believe that in certain circumstances, especially where larger public companies are concerned, additional safeguards are necessary, and that the public needs further protection. In such circumstances, in addition to civil remedies, criminal penalties should be attached, and it should be possible to prosecute those who blatantly disreguard the provisions of new clause 23.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) makes it an offence for a director to authorise or permit any transaction or arrangement in contravention of new clause 23.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) penalises the relevant company itself where it enters into prohibited transactions with one of its directors, or with a director of a holding company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) penalises any person who
	<span class='label label-info column'>498</span>
procures a relevant company to enter into a prohibited arrangement or transaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that these offences can be committed only where the offenders have full knowledge both of the connection of any beneficiary of a prohibited transaction with the company, and of any fact which puts the transaction in question outside the scope of any of the exceptions to the prohibitions. The use of the words "wilfully" in subsection (1) and "knowingly" in subsection (3) are intended to ensure that the prosecution will have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a defendant had actual knowledge of all the facts constituting the offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two of my right hon. and hon. Friends might ask why "wilfully" in one subsection and "knowingly" in another? That is a good question, to which the Department is seeking to provide an answer. We accept that the use of those two words in separate subsections is not entirely satisfactory. We shall, therefore, come back with proposals to introduce consistency into the subsections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that word "wilfully" in subsection (i) qualify both the "authorises" and the "permits"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman like to repeat the question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (1) refers to the director of a
	<br><blockquote><p>"relevant company who wilfully authorises or permits".</p></blockquote>
Does the word "wilfully" qualify both that authorisation and the permitting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Yes" is the answer to that question. There is some doubt, however, whether those words "wilfully" and "knowingly" accurately reflect the intention to ensure that the prosecution has to prove beyond reasonable doubt, and that is a matter to which we shall need to revert in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore exclude the possibility that persons can be prosecuted on the basis that they should have known of the facts, given the situation and their position in the company. In other words, what is known as "constructive knowledge" will not be prevented where the defendants have wilfully closed their eyes to an obviously illegal transaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer also to subsection (2) which imposes criminal penalties on the company
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0273">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>499</span>
itself. The Companies Acts impose penalties on companies in a number of circumstances in addition to any which may be imposed in the same circumstances on its officers. These provisions, such as section 131(5) of the 1948 Act in respect of a failure to call a general meeting, have proved useful. We believe that at the very least the possibility that a company may be fined may induce the shareholders to take appropriate steps to prevent further offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) sets out the penalties for committing the offences. It is straightforward and requires, the Committee will be relieved to hear, no lengthy explanation from me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon Members will appreciate that only deliberate conduct in the full knoweldge of the relevant circumstances, or on the basis of a wilful rejection of that knowledge, can be the subject of prosecution under this new clause. It will prove to be a useful supplement to our provisions on disclosure, and a useful addition to the civil remedies that will be available in safeguarding the interests of a relevant company and its shareholders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I consider this clause extremely easy to read. It appears to say what is intended and, if I may compliment the draftsmen—I am usually critical—it seems to be appropriate. That is why I hesitate to criticise any words in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the principle first—whether the accused has knowledge that a transaction is in contravention of the restrictions on loans, not whether he knows or does not know of the transaction itself. Therefore, it would perhaps be more helpful if, for example, in subsection (1)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"A director of a relevant company who wilfully authorises or permits the company to enter into a transaction or arrangement in contravention of section"—</p></blockquote>
and so on, the word "knowingly" was inserted before the words "in contravention". Does such a person know that it is a contravention of the statute?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to subsection (3):
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person who knowingly procures a relevant company to enter into a transaction or arrangement".</p></blockquote>
He may know that the company is entering into a transaction, but the question is whether he knows that the transaction is
	<span class='label label-info column'>500</span>
in contravention of the section. I throw that out as what might—or might not—be a pedantic comment on the drafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, a more serious comment can be made on subsection (4):
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person shall not be guilty of an offence under subsection (2)…".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (2) refers to an offence committed by a company. I know that in law "person" includes "company", but having seen the word "company" in some of these subsections and the word person" in others, one is given a bit of a jolt when reading subsection (4) to find that a person is relieved of liability. One therefore looks back to see what he is relieved of, to find that an individual cannot commit the crime under subsection (2), but a company is specifically mentioned. Therefore, I should have thought that subsection (4) should say that a company shall not be guilty of an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are perhaps pedantic comments on the drafting. Otherwise, the new clause is so easy to read, compared with all the other clauses, that it is a delight to find it on the Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my right hon. Friend agrees with me on the drafting of the new clause. Certainly, I do not have his immense legal expertise, but when I read these clauses I found that they seemed to say exactly what they were intended to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept my right hon. Friend's comments about the use of "wilfully" and "knowingly". I thank him for his suggestions, which we shall consider in the spirit in which he made them, to see whether we can take advantage of his expertise and improve the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of subsection (4) and the whole problem of "company" and "person", I think that, again, my right hon. Friend is making a valid point. I shall take advice on this matter and, if we can accommodate that suggestion, we certainly shall. If we cannot, I shall write to my right hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>503</span>
The purpose of new clause 28 is to require the disclosure in the accounts of the transactions described in new clauses 22 and 23. By word of introduction, may I say that the Government regard these disclosure provisions as among the most important of the new clauses regulating transactions between companies and directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prohibitions we discussed on the earlier new clauses, and the consequential civil and criminal remedies that will be available, are necessary as a defence against those who exploit a company's assets. But the intention is to support the measures that we are taking by trying to make sure that the shareholders are as informed as possible about the range of transactions being entered into, so that they can make up their minds for themselves that the directors of their company are doing a proper job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that that basic principle will ensure that directors will take care before entering into such transactions, because they will know that their shareholders will be fully informed about what the directors have done. I venture to suggest that had a number of our more notable company manipulators been aware that their shareholders were to be informed of what the directors were doing, many of the scandals of the last year or two might have been avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that these proposals that one should disclose the maximum amount possible can present problems for a certain range of companies and especially, given the banker-client relationship, for the banks. We have, therefore, suggestions to make which we hope will cater for that special problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I describe the new clause in detail, members of the Committee will wish to know that this new clause replaces the famous section 197 of the 1948 Act. As my hon. Friend said earlier when he introduced new clause 23, section 197 had two main defects. First, it has been taken to mean that only an aggregate and not an individual disclosure of loans to the officers of the company—this includes directors—has been necessary. Second, it has a specific exemption for loans made by companies whose ordinary course of business includes the lending of money. In the light of the events of the past few years, we believe that both these defects need to be remedied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>504</span>
I turn to subsection (1) of the new clause, which deals with holding companies which prepare group accounts. It puts them under a requirement to enter in such accounts details of, under paragraph (
	<i>a</i>), any transaction or arrangement specified in new clause 23. The disclosure of credit transactions is subject to the de minimis provision contained in new clause 32, such that if the aggregate value of the credit transactions outstanding at the end of the year to a director and his connected persons, if taken together, is less than £5,000, no details are required in the accounts. This marries up with the exclusion of the first £5,000 from the conditions set out in the exceptions to the prohibition to which new clause 24(2) refers. Secondly, under paragraph (
	<i>b</i>), they are required to show details of any agreements to enter into any transaction or arrangement covered by the preceeding paragraph (
	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we have in paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) the transaction or arrangement, and, in paragraph (
	<i>b</i>), the agreement to enter into any such transaction or arrangement. This provision will therefore require the notification of a commitment to participate in such a deal and should go some way to preventing prohibited deals actually taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) requires the disclosure of any other transaction or arrangement in which a director of the company had, indirectly or directly, a material interest. I shall discuss the provisions of paragraph (c) when I come to subsection (4). Subsection (2) deals with companies which are either subsidiaries or free-standing companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) provides that those companies which are parents of groups but do not prepare group accounts shall still furnish the details on loans and so on, as they would do if they were to prepare group accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) elaborates on the disclosure rules provided for in subsections (1)(
	<i>c</i>) and (2)(
	<i>c</i>) in relation to deals other than those prohibited in new clause 23. It will catch the disclosure not only of property transactions which are dealt with in new clause 22, but also any others of the type described in new clause 23, which, if they involve a material interest, relate to the connections of the director other than those specified in new clause 35, such as a brother, or to other evasive ways of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>505</span>
effecting the deals described in new clause 23. It will also require the disclosure of contracts for services—for example, consultancy contracts via the directors' own consultancy firm, which we discussed under new clause 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disclosure of contracts of service is already provided for under section 26 of the 1967 Act, and the terms of the paragraphs (
	<i>c</i>) of subsections (1) and (2) will require the additional disclosure of these other, indirect, agreements governing the employment of directors with their companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) of subsection (4), a director of a company or holding company is deemed to be interested in such a deal, by virtue either of being involved himself or of the involvement of one of his connected persons. Then, under paragraph (
	<i>b</i>), the material interest test is set out as the opinion of the majority of the directors, other than the one interested in the deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taken together, paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>) of subsection (4) put the onus on the director who is involved in a deal to seek the opinion of his fellow directors. If he does not do so, in the event of any question of such materiality arising in any court proceedings it will be determined by the court without any presumption either way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (6) provides for a number of other exemptions from disclosure. Paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) provides that loans made between companies do not need to be disclosed merely because they have a common director. Paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) exempts contracts of service, because separate provision is already made for their disclosure in section 26 of the 1967 Act, as I have pointed out. Hon. Members will recall that we shall be tabling a new clause to bring section 26 up to date. Paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) delimits disclosure to those transactions, arrangements or agreements which subsisted during the financial year in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (7) adds a clarificatory footnote to the rest of the clause. Paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) simply underlines that disclosure is required of the transactions and so on described in new clause 23, irrespective of whether they are prohibited or not, I should add here that no sanction for non-compliance with the disclosure provisions needs to be provided. This is because the existing sanctions in sections 150 and 149 of the 1948 Act—one deals with group accounts and the other with other accounts—will apply to
	<span class='label label-info column'>506</span>
any other director who fails to take all reasonable steps to secure compliance with the provisions of the Bill in respect of any accounts laid before the company in general meeting. The present penalties in relation to such an offence are an unlimited fine on indictment or the statutory maximum, currently £1,000, on summary conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) of subsection (7) ensures disclosure of deals involving persons who, subsequent to the deal, become a director or a connected person of such a director. We believe that this paragraph will be a way of closing a loophole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) of subsection (7) provides for the disclosure of transactions and so forth involving subsidiaries even if, subsequent to such transactions, the subsidiaries change hands. This is another example of the disclosure not going wider than the prohibition net. We have already discussed the exemption from the calculation of relevant amounts for deals involving subsidiaries which cease to be so on the grounds that the assets concerned are no longer group property. But we require them to be disclosed so that the shareholders can judge whether the directors are in fact taking substantial advantage of the exemption in new clause 25. Any collusive arrangement involving the sale of a subsidiary may well fall within the scope of new clause 23(4) covering back-to-back deals.

I am sure that members of the Committee are as tired of the sound of my voice as I am myself. I suggest that it might be a kindness to all concerned if we debated new clause 28 separately and then moved on to new clause 29, if that is acceptable to you, Sir Stephen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important new clause. The Minister of State is right to emphasise its significance. I share the view that disclosure represents the key if not to the avoidance of abuse, certainly to a contraction of the level of abuse that the present law has permitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My problem in approaching this new clause and a number of subsequent new clauses with which we shall deal is that I would very much welcome the benefit of advice from the accountancy bodies on these matters. As I understand it, they have not yet had an opportunity to formulate those views. They may have been in discussion with the Government—I assume that they have—but certainly they are not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>507</span>
yet in a position to discuss these matters in detail with us. Therefore, we may have to come back to them in some detail on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not an accountant, but I wondered whether subsection (6)(
	<i>c</i>) was consistent with good accountancy practice. The Minister for Trade is an accountant and will no doubt be able to put me right at once on this point. I want to know whether there should be some provision for a significant post-accounting date event to go into the accounts, or into some supplementary accounts. I do not know, but the hon. Gentleman will no doubt be able to put my mind at rest about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work done on this new clause—the Minister will be delighted to hear me say this—following the publication of our own Bill has led to tighter provisions being made. Certainly, it is a far more extensive provision than our own. But I add to my previous caveat that I shall wish to confer with those knowledgeable about such matters—the accountants in particular—before I come to a conclusion about the detail of the new clause. I am sure that the Minister will accept that that is a perfectly reasonable thing to do in the circumstances. But I welcome the proposals in general.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make two comments on new clause 28, both of which are connected with paragraphs (
	<i>c</i>) of subsections (1) and (2). I notice that later in the new clause, in subsection (6),
	<br><blockquote><p>"a contract of service between a company and one of its directors"</p></blockquote>
is excluded, but my hon. Friend talked about contracts with consultants or with a director who is a consultant. I am a little worried by the wording of these clauses as to whether, if a director who is a professional man—I declare an interest as a solicitor—acts for a company, all this has to be disclosed in the accounts. The same might occur with an estate agent or some such person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can imagine that, if there is a valuation by a director, it is necessary to let the company know that a valuation has been made by a director, but is it necessary to include in the accounts the fact that a solicitor who happens to be a director of a company acted for the company in some conveyancing matter or even in some litigation matter? It
	<span class='label label-info column'>508</span>
certainly is not the custom at present. Many of us in the profession take on directorships with no interest in the equity capital of the company but merely to give legal advice to the company. I hope that it is not necessary to go into details of that sort in the accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs (
	<i>c</i>) of subsection (1) and (2) speak of "a material interest". Subsection (1)(
	<i>c</i>) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any other transaction or arrangement with the company or with a subsidiary of the company in which a person who at any time during the relevant period was a director of the company had, directly or indirectly, a material interest."</p></blockquote>
Then one turns to subsection (3)(
	<i>b</i>) to find out what is meant by "a material interest". and one is told there that an interest is not material if a majority of the other directors are of opinion that it is not material. However, the question under subsection (1)(
	<i>c</i>) is whether it is material, not whether it is not material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, subsection (4)(
	<i>b</i>) does not mean that every interest shall be treated as material unless and until a majority of the other directors have expressed the opinion that it is not material. That is the way the new clause reads at the moment. One must assume that an interest is material until there is an expression of opinion by the other directors—I do not know whether it must be written or oral—that it is not material. Surely, it must be a matter of examining the transaction to see whether the director does have a material interest in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drafting may be at fault, or perhaps I have misread subsection (4) (
	<i>b</i>), but the two subsections must be taken together and we must know exactly what is the intention on the materiality—if that is a good word—of the interest of the director concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: An additional situation I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to consider is that of a director—say, the sales director—of a public company whose income depends in part on commissions or other payments achieved by transactions, sales and deals he gains with other companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the strict wording of the Bill, if I were a sales director of Rolls-Royce and I received a commission on a transaction with another company, presumably. I could be said to have a material interest in the contract into which I entered.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0278">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>509</span>
That should be added as one of the exceptions to this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We live in exciting times. My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) raised the question of consultancy contracts. I find myself in a difficulty here, as I am not sure that I agree with him and, as he knows, I am always reluctant to disagree with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For some time it has seemed to me that shareholders ought to have the right to know just what other agreements or income the directors are obtaining from the company. I do not think that a person in the position that my right hon. Friend described himself as being has anything at all to be concerned about if the shareholders know that in addition to the £100 a year—the nominal—or large sum which he takes as a director—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nominal, I assure the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my right hon. Friend takes nominal sums he undervalues his services. To argue this case, I take my own profession. It has always seemed to me wrong that the auditors of a company should reveal in the accounts what they charge for the audit fee but not reveal that they charge a huge sum of several times that for another range of professional services which they quite properly provide for the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suffered from that as a practising accountant when clients said to me "ICI can get itself audited for £5,000 and you want to charge me £500 when I employ only three men and a boy". One had to reply that if one saw the rest of ICI's charges one would find that it probably paid millions—I do not know; I have taken ICI as a generic example, not as a specific company—to the firm that did its audit, but only the one figure appeared in the accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend consider that this might be an argument for treating all professional advisers the same, and treating the auditors' charges qua auditors in the same way—in other words, not showing them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>510</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend that there is a case to be made both ways. What is confusing is to show one and not the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my right hon. Friend reconsiders this matter, perhaps he will feel it would be better for the shareholders to know that in addition to being a director of a company his firm quite properly provided legal services for which it received the sum of £X. I should have thought the shareholders ought to know that. They would then be aware that my right hon. Friend was making two contributions to the company's wellbeing and was being paid for both. There would be nothing improper in having those fees revealed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is perhaps a case, which my right hon. Friend and I can debate later, for arguing that consultancy fees should be revealed. But the truth of the matter is that as this Bill now stands they would need to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection to disclosing the fees. There is nothing to hide—provided that the Law Society does not accuse me of advertising, or something of that sort. What I object to are the details that will then have to be put into the accounts. If one has acted for a company in over 20 transactions during a year, are they to he set out in detail, with the costs charged in each case? If so, I should have thought that my hon. Friend's profession would object. The accounts will become so long that they will be unintelligible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most companies do not have an army of directors. We are discussing a relatively small number of people. But my right hon. Friend is once again making a perfectly valid point. The last thing we wish to do is to see the accounts cluttered up with information which is so detailed that it negates the purpose we seek to insist on by introducing these disclosure provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember one company, when I was a practising accountant, which produced monthly management accounts which were so comprehensive that they emerged at least as thick as the normal Bible. The net result was that nobody looked at them because the prospect of wading through them was almost intimidating. One therefore took one
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0279">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>511</span>
look at this great mass of information and decided that it was better not to bother. One could have spent hours searching for worthwhile information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend and I once again have a common object in view. We certainly do not want to clutter up the accounts. I shall look into the matter to see what we can do to meet that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of materiality, I confess that in my early morning reading this was a part of the new clause that I was not happy about, and I found it a little difficult to come to grips with. My understanding of the position is that according to subsection (4)(
	<i>a</i>) a director of the company, or holding company, is deemed to he interested in such a deal
	<span class='label label-info column'>512</span>
by virtue of either being involved himself or involved with one of the connected persons. Under subsection (4)(
	<i>b</i>) the material interest test is set out as the opinion of the majority of the directors other than the one interested in the deal. Taken together, subsection(4)(
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>) put the onus on the director who is involved in a deal to seek the opinion of his fellow directors—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
