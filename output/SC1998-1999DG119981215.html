	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for School Standards (Ms Estelle Morris)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Financing of Maintained Schools Regulations 1998.</p></blockquote>
I welcome you, Mr. O'Brien, to the Committee. I think it is the first time that I have served under your chairmanship. I am sure that it will be a pleasurable experience and that we will get these regulations agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations were considered on 8 December by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. They cover England and Wales, with variations which have seemed appropriate in the light of differing circumstances and consultation responses. The enabling powers are in sections 46 to 48 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Those sections, as enacted, apply to the new school categories—community, foundation and voluntary—which take effect on 1 September 1999. They also apply to the existing categories—county, voluntary and grant-maintained—between 1 April and 31 August by virtue of the School Standards and Framework Act (Modification) Regulations, which were made on 30 October under section 144 of the Act. In short, the sections apply to all schools, irrespective of their present or future category, and there are provisions for the transition stage between April and September.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations give effect to our proposals for a single funding regime for all schools within the new framework established under the Act. In practice, they replace the divisive dual system of financing which has existed since the introduction of GM status. The detailed proposals were set out at the end of May in the consultation paper "Fair Funding", and similar papers were issued in Wales in June.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several key objectives in the regulations. First, and most importantly, they put in place a framework that matches funding with the respective responsibilities of schools and local education authorities. That makes the funding arrangements more transparent; people can be accountable for what they spend and what they do. Within the framework, the regulations give all schools maximum scope for self-management by requiring significantly higher levels of financial delegation than has been the norm in LEA schools. But, they do so without forcing schools to take on responsibilities for which they do not feel ready. Another key objective is to treat community, voluntary and foundation schools equally. Schools will no longer get extra funding because of their
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
categories. The regulations also enable a smooth transition to the new funding framework for GM schools. This is a challenging time for such schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Extensive consultation has taken place on these regulations. We received more than 3,000 responses to "Fair Funding" in England and more than 500 to the document published in Wales, which led us to look carefully at our proposals, particularly those on the timing of additional delegation, which was the principle area on which we received responses. Decisions on the main issues were announced on 23 September both in England and Wales. In England, those decisions will mean that about £1 billion more can fall within the total of funds going directly into the classroom—but in a way that allows schools to feel comfortable with their extra responsibilities. Since September, we have undertaken detailed consultation with LEAs and national organisations, which has led us to modify the regulations so that valuable local flexibility is provided without the loss of essential features.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three crucial matters are governed by the regulations. The first is the balance between funding retained centrally by LEAs and funding distributed by them to schools, the second is the methods used by LEAs to allocate the funding that they distribute to schools, and the third is the content of the schemes that will regulate financial relationships between LEAs and the schools that they maintain, ensuring that governing bodies and head teachers can run their schools without unnecessary intervention from the LEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital to strike the right balance between pressing on with self-management and ensuring that schools have access to essential services. After consultation, we revised the timetable for delegation to give LEAs more time to work out suitable local arrangements in consultation with schools. We also reconsidered the range of items for which funding can be held centrally. Affected items include school meals, for which delegation will become optional for primary and special schools; outdoor education, which, following consultation, will still be funded centrally, if local authorities so wish; and library and museum services, for which earmarked funding is to be devolved to primary schools from April 2000. That means that schools currently maintained by LEAs will have substantially greater delegation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Delegated funds will be available for a wider range of administrative support services from April 2000. English schools will take full responsibility for non-capital building repairs and maintenance from April 1999, and Welsh schools from April 2000. The process for approving education development plans is crucial to the success of "Fair Funding", and will require LEAs to refocus their expenditure on inspection and advisory services and teaching and learning-support activities. Expenditure on supporting services that cannot be justified by reference to approved education development plans must be delegated from April 1999 in England and from April 2000 in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Funding for school meals must be delegated to secondary schools by 2000. In England, such funding must be delegated by 1999, provided that there are no contractual complications. From 2000, primary and special schools in England can opt for the delegation of funding for meals. In Wales, the position for such schools is slightly different, because LEAs must decide whether to accede to their requests for delegated funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
LEAs have contracts for some centrally organised services that do not expire until after the date by which funding must be delegated. We recognise that problem and understand that many schools could go elsewhere for such services, leaving LEAs with a liability that they cannot meet because they have no funds. After considering responses to "Fair Funding", we have decided that delegation of funding must go ahead on time, but that LEAs that are at risk of serious financial difficulties can apply for schools to be bound into contracts for up to three years. Such binding-in provisions must be included in LEAs' school financing schemes, which require the Secretary of State's approval. When such approval is given, LEAs will be able to delegate funds at the actual cost of the contract, so that schools do not lose out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Willis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrogate and Knaresborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that regulation apply to schedule 2,10(a), (b) and (c), which deal with special educational needs? I support the Minister's proposals for developing inclusive education, especially the important half-way step of partial integration. Will three-year contracts be available to encourage such collaboration? At the moment, only annual contracts are available, so long-term provision cannot be planned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not referring to such contracts. Some local authorities have signed contracts for three years or more. We wanted to ensure that they were not left with a financial liability that they can meet only at the taxpayer's and ratepayer's expense. Special educational needs do not fall into that category. Forward planning is important, and the Treasury has given my Department an indication of the funds that will be available over the next three years through the comprehensive spending review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our aim is to ensure that we raise the level of delegations to LEA schools. Making the transition from the existing system of financing grant-maintained schools could mean that such schools undergo a period of instability, which is what we want to avoid. Our general principle is that, where funding for a service must eventually be delegated, LEAs must delegate it to GM schools from April 1999. That will ensure continuity in the delegation of funding, to which they have become accustomed. The principle is reflected at various points in schedule 1 for England and regulation 5 for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III and schedule 3 deal with the way in which the individual schools budget is distributed to schools through LEAs' funding formulae. The key principle has been continuity. LEAs already have flexibility to reflect local curcumstances and priorities in their formulae; we do not want them to make major changes
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
if they see no good reason to do so. Therefore, the regulations do not set out a single formula, but offer in schedule 3 a range of factors under which LEAs can meet local requirements. LEAs will retain their discretion as to how to count pupils for funding purposes, but 80 per cent, of primary and secondary funding must be allocated on a pupil-led basis. We received several responses on that issue. It is difficult to make a judgment between 81 per cent, and 79 per cent., and there was no clear consensus to change from the current 80 per cent. On reflection, we felt that the present rule is about right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The formulae must be fair to all categories of schools, and must be fully considered by all schools in an area. LEAs must consult all schools, including current GM schools, on their allocation formulae. Many are doing so already. The requirement includes consultation on age weightings used to allocate funding as well as all other factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want GM schools to experience unmanageable changes in their budgets as a result of the new system. In England, we intend to protect the 1998–99 amount of funding in cash terms received per pupil for 1999–2000. I know that representatives of GM schools have welcomed that. The funding arrangements in Wales are different. They relate to so few schools—about 20—that the funding is based primarily on the local management of schools arrangements of the relevant LEA. The difference between GM and local authority school budgets is thus less marked in Wales. My hon. friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Hain) has decided not to introduce transitional arrangements for GM schools in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements for managing the transition of GM schools' budgets continue the process of aligning them with those of other schools, which was begun by the previous Government. They instituted a phased removal of the unfair cash protection of central annual maintenance grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part IV and schedule 5 deal with contents of the schemes for the financing of schools that LEAs will have to draw up. Each scheme will define the financial relationship between an LEA and the schools that it maintains, and will require approval by the Secretary of State. The regulations simply list topics that must be covered. Statutory guidance issued by the Secretary of State under schedule 14 will indicate in more detail how we expect LEAs to cover them. A draft of that guidance has already been issued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to note two things. First, the outline scheme, and schemes that LEAs will submit, cover ground already covered in greater or lesser detail in LMS schemes. They provide a good opportunity to review LEAs' financial provisions after nine years of LMS. Secondly, the scheme is as binding on LEAs as it is on schools. It will secure crucial rights for schools, such as the right to a bank account and the right to determine spending priorities. Part V of the regulations also sets out requirements for publication of schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The regulations are crucial to the setting up of a new framework for schools. We must ensure that money allocated to schools is spent on pupils' needs. For the first time, there will be transparency and accountability in the educational spending of local authorities. Much has been done over the past few months to get the system ready. I appreciate the way in which local authorities, the GM sector and schools have responded to the consultation and worked rapidly in the past six months to ensure that the new schools funding system will be ready by the start-up date. I thank all of them for that, and commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Maidenhead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you, Mr. O'Brien, to the Committee. This is the first time that I have had the benefit of being a member of a Committee under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's debate is important, albeit that it has been scheduled for the final week of Parliament before the Christmas recess. It sets the scene for the rules under which schools will be able to operate with their delegated budgets. We debated the subject in some detail in the Standing Committee of the Bill that became the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Concern was expressed then that the statements in the legislation were of motherhood and apple pie. Statements by Ministers at the time were certainly all about the importance of delegation to schools. We welcome the Labour party's conversion to the management of local schools, which has been of enormous benefit to schools over the years in freeing them to manage their own budgets. We support the principle of as much delegation as possible, to enable each school to be free to make decisions about what is right for it. Governors and head teachers of grant-maintained schools that have enjoyed that facility have talked about the ability that the freedom to manage their complete budget gave them to implement educational improvements. They have been able to manage their budgets more satisfactorily than some local education authorities did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the School Standards and Framework Act came into force, the Government issued statements about delegation of budgets down to schools. Several commentators and others had things to say, and the Government portrayed the move as 100 per cent, delegation. With this Government, we know better than to believe the rhetoric because the devil is always in the detail. The detail of these regulations is that there is 100 per cent, delegation of budgets to schools only after the LEA has been allowed to top-slice a significant number of items of expenditure. Schedule 1 identifies no fewer than 89 such items that an LEA may retain within its budget rather than allow them to be delegated to schools. As the regulations show, the reality differs greatly from the Minister's rhetoric. As in so many other cases that I have often quoted as a member of Committees on education, the rhetoric is one thing, the reality another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following with great interest what the hon. Lady is saying. She rightly referred to the 89 items that LEAs may retain. Which of them does she think should be deleted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I speak on schedule 1, which identifies the 89 areas of activity, it will become clear that an LEA is able to categorise a number of them in whichever way it deems fit. Schools are concerned that the 89 areas introduce extra costs that LEAs will be able to hold back—as a direct result of Government policy on changing the structure of education. A number of the 89 items in schedule 1 identify not only areas of expenditure with which LEAs are accustomed to dealing in certain ways, but extra expenditure that the Government have imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make several detailed points about the regulations. I am aware that some members of the Committee are worried about the time, so I shall try to be as speedy as possible. None the less, the regulations raise some genuine questions about how the definitions will operate and what attitude the Government will take towards them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the structure of the regulations, the local education authority will initially set the local schools budget, and can take items out of it in order to determine and detail individual schools' budgets. The devil is in the detail of regulation 4 and schedule 1. Schedule 1 raises several questions about how the regulations will operate. It is clearly a bureaucrat's charter for local education authorities. It contains the statement, upfront, before the 89 categories are set out:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Expenditure of a class or description referred to in this Schedule includes expenditure on associated administrative costs and overheads."</p></blockquote>
Those who have worked, like me, in a local education authority will know that that virtually gives carte blanche to LEAs to define "administrative costs and overheads" in order that they can hold back money from schools. Our main anxiety is the extent to which the regulations enable local education authorities to do so. Under the programme of school improvement and access to education, the Government have introduced education development plans, school organisation committees and school organisation plans. The extra costs of those can now be held back by the local education authority and not delegated to schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs 22 and 23 of schedule 1, which the Minister mentioned, refer to a local education authority's ability to hold back expenditure on music tuition and on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Expenditure which enables pupils to enhance their experience of the visual and performing arts other than music."</p></blockquote>
I am aware of a genuine debate about where it is best for money to be held in order to ensure music provision in schools. What does the Minister envisage that a local education authority will hold back from schools under paragraph 23, which I have just quoted? I fear that an LEA might say, "Here is the expenditure that we shall make on these services—take it or leave it", or that schools that want to spend money on enhancing pupils' experience of the visual and performing arts will have to apply to the LEA for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
expenditure in order to put a project into practice. That would take us back to the bad old days. Local management of schools was not intended only to set schools free to make their own decisions, but to set them free from the bureaucratic processes that usually apply in the allocation of funding by LEAs and in funding applications to LEAs. The regulations raise a question about what the categories are intended to cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made specific reference to library and museum services. Similarly, the regulations raise a genuine question about what expenditure on those services the local education authority will be able to take out of the local schools budget. What expenditure will be expected to be within the local schools budget that can subsequently be taken out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Valerie Davey

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Schools already find it incredibly difficult to determine individually expenditure on areas such as the creative arts. Local education authorities have in the past had a good reputation in providing for music and challenging schools to recognise that the visual and performing arts and library and museum services—none of which an individual school can sustain alone—are good areas for co-operation. The wording of the regulations encourages all schools to consider that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to accept that many LEAs have provided good music services for schools. Many schools have done a great deal in music and in enabling pupils to experience the visual and performing arts. They have been able, within their budgets, to provide experiences for their pupils, which were not being offered by the LEA. If the money is taken from them, that choice to determine, at school level, what is right for pupils is removed. That worries me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What part of library and museum services would come within the local schools budget and could thus be taken out of it to determine the individual school's budget? For many LEAs, museum services would come not within an education budget, but within a leisure or recreational services budget. There is a question of defining exactly what is being taken away. My main concern is to ensure that schools maintain the freedom to make decisions about what is right for their pupils. The more I see LEAs drawing up expenditure without delegating it, the more I am concerned about the ability of schools to make such decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have several other detailed points on schedule 1 to which I hope the Minister can respond. I apologise for going backwards and forwards in the regulations. Paragraph 32 says that the LEA can retain
	<br><blockquote><p>"Expenditure on establishing and maintaining electronic computer systems—in so far as they link, or facilitate the linkage of, the authority to schools which they maintain, such schools to each other or such schools to other persons or institutions."</p></blockquote>
A good argument will doubtless be advanced for saying that that is obviously a main area of expenditure. The centralisation of networks makes sense. But, it also makes sense for schools to have the freedom to set up their own networks with other schools or, potentially, local businesses. There are
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
good examples in my constituency of collaboration between IT companies and schools to provide services and facilities to mutual benefit. Again, I question the LEA's ability to take that expenditure up to the centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that, if the parental leave directive comes into place, paragraphs 34 and 35 will need to be adjusted accordingly. There is a question concerning paragraph 36 about the work of advanced skills teachers and the extent to which schools are required to provide people in front of classes when advanced skills teachers have been sent to operate in other schools in the authority or elsewhere. Paragraph 36 provides for expenditure to be held back for longer term coverage for someone who is seconded on a full-time basis. The standard three months is given as the cut-off point. Is that appropriate? What happens to a school in which an advanced skills teacher is required to go elsewhere in the authority? Is it required to fund his or her replacement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a question about the regulations, such as regulation 14, which concerns the concept of discrimination by reference to category. Although the question is most obvious in that regulation, it feeds through into other aspects too, such as the position of schools in education action zones. I assume that the regulation on the functioning governing bodies was put in to cover the differences in community, foundation and voluntary schools, but what about schools within an education zone where the governing body has delegated its authority and powers to the education action zone forum? How will expenditure on governing body facilities, services and so forth relate to those categorisations? Those are my questions to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also an issue about the schemes in schedule 5. One concern raised by school governors related to the way in which some LEAs have allowed schools their own bank acounts, all the money up front and their own cheque books. One Labour authority allocated a cheque book to a school, provided that the annual interest was paid on the amount that would have been earnt if the delegation has not taken place. That poses questions about the rate of interest that schools are required to pay to the LEA—once again finding ways of taking money away from schools. That is an important problem, yet the regulations say nothing about the Government's view or about whether they will provide guidance on that matter to LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to address briefly the percentage of pupil-led funding. I heard the Minister's comments about the Government's reason for retaining the 80 per cent, rate, but I have an inquiry about the drafting of regulation 22. I apologise if I have misunderstood it—I spent some time going through the regulations—but regulation 22 does not set out clearly enough which aspects of pupil-led funding should be categorised within the 80 per cent, figure. It states that the 80 per cent, funding will be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"allocated in one or more of the following manners",</p></blockquote>
but the subsequent paragraphs are of different orders of magnitude. The first two relate to overall pupil numbers, but the others relate to more specific
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
requirements, such as when places are reserved in a reception class for children from a nursery class or when particular categories of special educational needs are involved. Will the Government provide further guidance to LEAs about how the 80 per cent, should be calculated? Have they stepped aside from the requirements of weighting base pupil numbers rather than other categories in regulation 22? I would be grateful if the Minister responded to those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have more specific comments on the regulations. As I have said, 89 classes of expenditure can be held back by the LEA. Yet Ministers' statements are all about the need to delegate and to channel money to schools. Schools should have as much money as possible in their budgets; it should not be held back at LEA level for purposes on which schools can make better decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister justified the regulations in terms of stopping the dual financing system of extra funding being allocated on the basis of a school's category. Grant-maintained schools were provided with funds because they took on extra responsibilities which had previously been discharged by LEAs. They proved successful in managing those extra responsibilities and their budgets, and in providing improved education for children in their schools as a result of having the freedom to take their own decisions. We want schools to be set free to make such decisions, but I fear that the regulations will not allow that. They amount to a bureaucrat's charter for LEAs to find a myriad of ways of holding money back from schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Brien, and congratulate the hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) on the diligence with which she has read the regulations. It is a pity that, despite her vigilance, she was unable to answer a basic question: which of the regulations would she change? It is also a pity that she managed to rewrite history, although I fear not very effectively. Her comments about grant-maintained schools were somewhat ill judged, and took little or no account of the views of the Select Committee—which had a Conservative majority—that investigated these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may, indeed, have been before the hon. Lady's time, but given the diligence with which she has studied the regulations, one might assume that she had studied with equal diligence other matters relating to grant-maintained schools. Perhaps she now wishes to look at the Select Committee's report, which showed clearly that GM schools were not merely receiving additional money for additional functions, but, in many respects, were being double-funded for those additional responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I am delighted that the regulations move us on to a level playing field financially for all schools. That change is long overdue. However, that does not mean that I am entirely happy with everything in the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Day 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cheadle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain what on earth he is doing on the Opposition Benches? He seems to me to be making a most efficient speech in favour of the Government line. This is the Opposition side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was so busy talking to the hon. Member for Maidenhead that he missed the sentence that answers his point. I said, as the record will demonstrate, that my remarks did not mean that I was entirely happy with everything in the regulations. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will care to listen as I elucidate on the bits of the regulations with which I am unhappy—unlike the hon. Member for Maidenhead, who covered the matter in general terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first matter about which I am not entirely happy stems from a fundamental premise in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998: the creation of three different types of school. One reason that the regulations are necessary is that the Government have chosen to establish foundation schools as well as community schools. We argued during the passage of the School Standards and Framwork Bill that there ought to be a single school, and that the establishment of foundation schools would provide a sop to grant-maintained schools. We are obviously unhappy that the regulations continue that division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have individual worries about the application of some aspects, especially in relation to schedules. I will touch on those in a while. I am delighted that the Government were prepared to listen carefully to representations on "Fair Funding". We were particularly pleased about two of the representations. First, we are glad that, after reconsideration, outdoor activity centres are to remain within the remit of LEAs if they wish to provide such facilities. Secondly, we on the Liberal Democrat Benches are delighted with the decision about music, which the hon. Member for Maidenhead mentioned. It is vital that LEAs, in consultation with their local schools, are able to determine the best way forward to ensure that that vital aspect of the education service is continued. The decision is greatly to be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a third area—provision of school meals—about which the Government have not taken sufficient notice. The Minister has made a number of exceptions in the regulations to take account—relative to secondary schools—of on-going contracts that must be honoured, which we welcome. The hon. Member for Bristol, West (Valerie Davey) rightly referred to the importance of several services that can best be provided only by the economies of scale that an LEA can make on behalf of its schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson (Lord Commissioner to the Treasury)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Whip no doubt refers to outdoor activity centres and music. I would argue that the same case can be made for the school meals service. The Minister will be well aware that it is perfectly possible for a relatively large secondary school to run its own school meals service, as we acknowledge. Indeed, it may be possible for some secondary schools to run their school meals service at a profit, and to use those profits to enhance the education that they provide. However, as I hope the Minister will recognise, that case cannot be made for smaller secondary schools and, in particular, cannot be made for small primary schools. Schools run by the LEA are genuinely worried that they will not benefit from the economies of scale that it can make and that serious damage to the school meals service in smaller schools could result. I welcome LEAs' continuing responsibility for free school meals, but the complication of secondary schools taking responsibility for their school meals services and primary schools not doing so may lead to confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confess to some difficulty in understanding the agreement that seems to be taking place between the Conservative party and the Labour party. There seems to be complete unanimity. The hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) is right: there needs to be some opposition from time to time to this unhealthy coalition, especially the proposal that 80 per cent, of funding must be allocated to pupil-led purposes. The hon. Member for Maidenhead said that she was perfectly happy that, after consideration, the Government have decided to stick with 80 per cent. The Minister said that the debate had been over whether the proportion should be 79 or 81 per cent., and that she had decided on 80 per cent. That is not too surprising, if that is as far as her imagination allows her to go. However, if hon. Members truly believe, as Liberal Democrat Members do, that decisions are best made locally, no percentage should be specified in the regulations, so that local education authorities may decide how best to determine the local management of schools formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be well aware that, in the inspection of schools, which will involve not only the Office for Standards in Education but the Audit Commission, the new regulations will ensure that the nature of the formula is examined in considerable detail. She could, therefore, have been confident in leaving decisions on such matters to LEAs. No doubt in her defence against the scurrilous attacks of the hon. Member for Maidenhead about administration, she will make that point. As has been clearly stated, inspection of LEAs will include careful examination of LEAs' administrative costs. The anxieties expressed by the hon. Member for Maidenhead should not worry us today. Her comments might have been more interesting had she taken them a stage further and asked why, if there is such anxiety about administrative costs, the Government are placing constraints on the administrative costs of LEAs but not on those of education action zones. Why do the regulations contain nothing on that issue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
I should like briefly to make two other points. The first relates to something that is not in the regulations but needs to be covered.The Minister rightly referred to the £1 billion that may additionally be made available to schools. I am surprised that she said £1 billion; the Government usually boast by saying that the amount is in fact £1.1 billion. That £1 billion is not additional Government money; it is the increase in the standard spending assessment. Whether it will be available to schools is a different matter. The Minister will be aware that a vast amount of that money, which may be made available to schools, will have to come through a bidding process. Since the Government took office 18 months ago, 16,000 bids have been made by schools and local education authorities. Ten thousand bids have been unsuccessful, but they have still required a great deal of administrative time and effort. Which of the 89 categories mentioned by the hon. Member for Maidenhead refers to the money needed by local education authorities in preparing for future bids? The Minister may tell me that the answer is to be found in schedule 1(41), which is a catch-all provision that allows for expenditure on anything else, provided that the total amounts to
	<br><blockquote><p>"no more than 0.1 per cent, of the authority's local schools budget".</p></blockquote>
Is that amount sufficient?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, we welcome the regulations, despite our concerns about the school meals service. We believe that they will create a level playing field for funding all our state schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maidenhead expressed anxiety about percentages. I hope that schools and education authorities will each receive 100 per cent, funding for the roles and responsibilities that we identify for them. That will help to avoid the ludicrous annual situation of schools and LEAs blaming one another for their problems, and both blaming central Government. We need greater clarity about responsibilities and sources of funding. Knowing where responsibility lies will create a truly accountable education service. The regulations help to do that, so we welcome them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.17am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the contributions that hon. Members have made to the debate. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) accepted that "Fair Funding" should move towards transparency and accountability of funding. The key is ensuring that money from the Treasury is spent on education, and that myth and fear among education partners are dispelled. Energy and expertise that are wasted trying to find out who is spending what and why could be used for the benefit of people in schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will address some specific points before turing to generalities. I sensed a wide welcome for the increase in delegated funds brought about by "Fair Funding", even though there were some peripheral concerns. The hon. Member for Maidenhead is right about music, library and museum services. In Birmingham, those services are funded through the leisure budget, not the education budget. Clearly, local authorities can fund
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
such services through the education budget, provided they are of direct benefit to schools. Libraries, for example, can receive funding for the book-loan system, which is more likely to be taken up by primary schools than by secondary schools. Museums might receive funding for exhibitions relating to part of the national curriculum. Local authorities must be clear about how that narrowly defined aspect of the education budget is divided and spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could debate whether music services should be protected by central holding. Music services that have been delegated to schools have sometimes suffered. "Fair Funding" received so many strong and passionate responses, not only from those who were concerned about money but from those who wished to protect the music service, that we had to do something centrally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Clark 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Kent music school, many of whose concerts and sessions I have attended, is extremely worried about delegation to individual schools. It has been able to provide not only the facilities required by schools and pupils, but the cheap hire or loan of instruments to children who are deciding whether to learn those instruments. Children have thus been spared great expense before they are certain of their choice. One of the school's big worries is that complete delegation would result in the loss of that facility for many children in Kent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, but the hon. Member fror Maidenhead was also right to say that some schools had chosen to spend the money on a music service. I pay tribute to them and to the work that they do. Those opportunities for music were not provided across the range of schools. A child's access to that important part of the curriculum should not depend on the school he attends: it should be accessible wherever he is. I am grateful for my hon. Friend's comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maidenhead mentioned the creative and the performing arts. We made an adjustment after we had consulted on "Fair Funding". Local authorities told us that they found it difficult to differentiate between the two in the provision of services. The provision of music is often matched by that for theatre in education and drama—it is part of the same thing. A child who is taking part in performances and creative art will do music, art and so on. Central expenditure could be retained for theatre in education. We feared that if we did not make that clear, we would have arguments about the precise definitions of visual arts, music and performing arts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have mechanisms to ensure that the system is not abused, and while we have those mechanisms we should not make life more difficult for schools and local authorities. There has been a demise in the performing arts in recent years. I hope that the new way of funding them with extra resources will lead to the rebirth in all schools of the quality work currently done in some schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
The hon. Lady expressed concern about bank accounts, which I share. The scheme will have to be approved by the Secretary of State, so we will be able to keep a check on it. My understanding is that, if the local authority pays money into the school bank account each term, it will be able to claw back what it has lost in interest and it will be able to keep the interest. The scheme cannot allow a local authority to take out every bit of interest that accrues to that account, but it should be recompensed for what it loses if it pays a term in advance. That will be laid out in the scheme that the Secretary of State will approve. The initiative is new and there are fears about it, but I am happy to give the assurance that we will keep an eye on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for her comments. An even more technical issue is the rate of interest that some local authorities might take from schools' bank accounts. In putting the overall budget on deposit or on the money markets, local authorities can get a better rate of interest than the schools could. A number of schools are worried that they will be disadvantaged and that the local authority will treat them as though the money were being used on a wholesale basis rather than as an individual small amount of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will need to look at that as the schemes come forward. What is important is what underpins them. Schools should have the opportunity to have their own bank account without putting local authorities at a financial loss. Although the rates will differ on the local authority's account and the school's account, our guiding principle will be that the amount that it can claw back, as a top slice from the money before it pays it a term in advance, is that which would have accrued had it kept its money in its own account. There has been much to-ing and fro-ing on that. The position that we have now reached is generally accepted by representatives of school groups and by the Local Government Association. We look forward to moving forward on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provision is made in the regulations for local authority finance schemes to apply to EAZ forums. The hon. Member for Maidenhead and others should realise that this is a new initiative and that we intend to keep a careful eye on it. To secure extra money from central Government, forums and EAZs are obliged to provide details of where the money is going. Under the first half of the first phase, that is already taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Money currently comes from specific grants under the standards fund for advanced skills teachers. As numbers grow to 5,000 and eventually 10,000 the system will be kept under review. The hon. Member for Maidenhead asked about the time that advanced skills teachers will have to spend outside school hours. We want to ensure that the scheme is properly funded. If ASTs are to work—I desparately want them to, as they are a good innovation and should raise standards—there must not be any financial disincentive for schools to employ them. They are currently funded through specific grants but, as I said, we will want to keep the system under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
I take the hon. Member for Bath's point about school meals. It is a different issue and I would not pretend otherwise. I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman welcomed the adjustment that we made after consultation. We will issue guidance on school meals to local authorities in the new year. We want a menu of healthy and cost-effective options and we will work with local authorities on the best way to take up their new powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am mindful of the danger of defending a meals service whose dissatisfaction rates are growing relative to previous years. Not everyone is thrilled with the meals service; there is no huge uptake and not everybody believes that the quality is good. Over the past few years, far fewer children have chosen school meals: there has been a steady decline. Adults tend to believe that school meals are a good thing for their kids; but pupils vote with their feet—or their money tokens—and often go elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A twin-track approach—introducing nutritional standards and encouraging schools to be more innovative—is intended to increase the uptake of school meals. That is part of what we view as a healthy school agenda. I recently visited a GM school in Birmingham with a delegated budget, which showed that some such schools have made good decisions about how best to use the budget to find alternative meal provision. We want to promote that sort of innovation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remember that primary schools do not have to take up the delegated budget. Responses showed that they did not want school meal responsibility. The disparity between what secondary schools wanted and what primary schools felt able to cope with was more obvious in respect of school meals than in any other issue on which we consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is of course right that it would be foolish to suggest that the current school meal service is universally welcomed. She is also right that we need more innovative ideas to address the problem. However, she fails to acknowledge that the best way to encourage more pupils to eat school meals is to start when they are young—in the primary school sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that the regulations may leave LEAs providing a school meals service only in the primary sector because secondary schools will have to take up the delegation. That poses the question whether it is possible—without the economies of scale provided by the secondary sector's participation—for individual LEAs to provide the exciting, lively and value-for-money meals service for primary schools that we want. If not, there will be a decline in the school meals service and everything that the Minister says she wants will crumble away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman describes a worst-case scenario that was put to us by others during consultation. Secondary schools may buy back from local authorities as well: nothing in regulations prohibits secondary schools from buying the local authority meals service. The bottom line—I genuinely believe that it is that—is that if local authorities offer
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
a good quality meals service, people will buy it; if not, they will go elsewhere. If we are to revitalise healthy eating with new nutritional standards, we cannot depend on services that no one wishes to buy because they do not think that they are of sufficient quality. I estimate—it is a guesstimate because I have no evidence—that a good few secondary schools will buy back from their local authority because they are, and have been, content to do so. Also, competition may make local authorities provide a more exciting meals service than some did in the past. Many local authorities do an excellent job providing an excellent meals service to schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless the Minister riles me, I will not seek to intervene again. The hon. Lady may be right in saying that individual secondary schools will negotiate to buy back from local authorities, but the point that I think she is missing is that because, under the new climate introduced by the regulations, schools will have the power to go it alone, negotiations will be on a different footing; schools will have the power to opt out and run services themselves if they so wish. They will therefore be well aware that, LEAs will, in a sense, be making a profit on school meals in secondary schools, which at present they use to subsidise the primary sector. If they seek to get back that share of the profit for themselves, the money will not be available to the primary sector. My concern is that if we take out one sector of schools—those schools in which it is possible easily to run an efficient and profit-making service—we shall lose the other schools, which will decline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand exactly what the hon. Gentleman describes; it is the worst-case scenario. To some extent we shall have to wait and see. We begin from the premise that we wanted to delegate as much as possible to schools. Secondary schools welcome the option of having funding for meals devolved to them. Some schools in the GM sector have already exercised that option, and in a way that, in their view, has provided children with a better service. That must always be our guiding point: the bottom line must always be the correct system for ensuring that the service is of better quality and delivered more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A general point that is of primary importance—and one that underpinned the initial comments of the hon. Member for Maidenhead, although she protested too much—is that we must keep an eye on ensuring that money is not frittered away by local authorities on administrative work. We are now able in many ways not only to know about but to monitor and hold to account local authorities over the sums that they spend on administration. We can do so through the approval of the education development plan—which will show a local authority's planned expenditure and allow us, while we are approving EDPs, to go back to them and question their spending—and the powers taken in the Act to ensure that they cannot spend on administration money that should be sent to schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
I take exception to the remarks of the hon. Member for Maidenhead. Within 20 months of taking office, we have devised a financial system that delegates more money to schools, is transparent, does not treat schools differently according to category, and will ensure that more money goes into classrooms. The hon. Lady's Government never did that. It is all very well for her to talk about greater levels of delegated funding—her Government had the chance to act, but turned it down. It has fallen to the present Government to ensure that more money is delegated to schools. We have taken the best of LMS—local management of schools—and the lessons that have been learnt from the GM sector, while at the same time acknowledging that good local authorities have a worthwhile role to play in school improvement. We have before us a new funding system that will match the new framework and deliver the transparency and accountability—with money for schools—that will underpin the standards agenda that the Government hold dear. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
