	<p>4.38 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Sir Paul Beresford)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Central Manchester Development Corporation (Area and Constitution) Order 1996.</p></blockquote>
The order is required to wind up the Central Manchester development corporation. It revokes the 1988 order, which designated the urban development area and established the development corporation. The order will take effect in two stages: the part of the order that designated the urban development area is to be revoked on 1 April 1996, and the part that established the corporation is to be revoked on 1 July 1996. That will allow hon. Members who wish to visit the area to do so. Under this two-stage process, the corporation will cease to exercise operational functions after 31 March 1996; it is therefore appropriate for the urban development area status to be removed on that date. The corporation will have three months in which to produce its final accounts and report, and to wind up its affairs. It will finally be dissolved on 1 July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two other orders have been laid before the House. One transfers the CMDC's planning functions to the appropriate local authorities on 25 March 1996; the other transfers to the Secretary of State for the Environment those of the corporation's property rights and liabilities that have not been disposed of by 26 March. The orders are subject to the negative resolution procedure. A dissolution order is also required, but it is not subject to parliamentary procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to list the corporation's considerable achievements during the past eight years. It is precisely because the corporation has achieved so much, and set the stage for continuing regeneration, that we are able to wind it up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corporation was set up in June 1988 with a remit to revitalise, and to bring back private investment to, an area that was once the powerhouse of Manchester but which had become run-down and neglected. It is an area of 187 hectares south of the city centre, running from the canal basins behind Piccadilly station in the east to Castlefield and the River Irwell in the west. In 1988, that area had many underused and obsolescent buildings, derelict sites and neglected streets and waterways. It was not attracting market interest commensurate with its location or its potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Attempts to regenerate the central part of the city, such as the Phoenix study undertaken by a group of local business men, had failed to turn things around. However, the advent of the development corporation brought together public and private sector interests to
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
boost the fortunes of this great city. Two of the local business men involved in the Phoenix initiative, Raymond Gerrard and the late Ken Alford, were invited on to the board of the corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, from the beginning, the corporation established a close working relationship with the city council—a partnership which has grown stronger in the years since. Three council members have been on the board since 1988. They are Graham Stringer, Labour leader of the city council, who last year said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"this development corporation is in danger of giving quangos a good name",</p></blockquote>
Jack Flanagan, who is also chairman of Manchester airport, and Joyce Hill, the then leader of the Conservative group. The effectiveness of the corporation has been all the greater for the chairmanship of James Grigor, who spent much of his career as an industrial chemist in Trafford Park, and the deputy chairmanship of Derek Boothman, who has brought financial expertise to the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corporation produced an initial strategy document, called "Opportunities", which set out its vision for the area and attracted early interest and early investment. After extensive public consultation, a development strategy was published in 1990, identifying the need to tackle environmental decay, to boost tourism and jobs and to bring housing back to the city centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corporation has succeeded on all those fronts. Anyone who has seen the area recently, as I have, cannot fail to be impressed by the transformation. New housing has been built where there was none before. There are large new commercial and leisure developments, as well as many successful conversions of previously neglected buildings. Canals have been restored and high-quality landscaping introduced, and that has inspired confidence in investors. Tourism has been boosted by the development of new facilities and by the general uplift in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the end of March, 35 hectares of previously derelict or unused land will have been reclaimed, more than 144,000 sq m of new floor space will have been developed, and nearly 2,600 homes will have been built. Furthermore, more than 5,000 new jobs will have been created, and private sector investment of £376 million will have been levered in. For every £1 of public money invested by the corporation, the private sector will have invested nearly £4. That is an impressive achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A splendid example of the effective partnerships that the corporation has formed with local authorities and with the private sector is the new international concert hall, the Bridgewater hall, which is due to open this autumn. It was conceived and financed in partnership with the city council, together with substantial backing from the European regional development fund. It is the centrepiece for the regeneration of an entire sector of the city wtih new offices, hotels and homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important part of the corporation's work has been to bring people and vitality back to the city centre, by encouraging developers to create new housing schemes; many of them are in old, restored buildings. In 1988, the population of the urban development area was just 250. Now, nearly 4,000 people live in the area. Some 1,000 new homes are in the Whitworth "village", which was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
once a run-down area, but is now a vibrant community with support services and popular bars, pubs and restaurants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work that the corporation has done to restore the city's canals and to improve the urban environment has proved an important catalyst and has been important in all senses, but especially for housing developments. Two outstanding developments are at Castle quay, which was created from a former cotton warehouse, and, close to it, the new Slate wharf development of around 100 waterside flats. The corporation has also helped to meet the growing demand for accommodation for students. It has contributed £4 million in city grant to create the Dunlop "village", which houses more than 1,000 students. The housing market in central Manchester has proved to be one of the most buoyant in Britain, with nearly 98 per cent. of completed homes already occupied. Demand for new housing sites in the city centre continues apace, and developers are now confident of success without further need for grant support. That is a measure of the corporation's success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corporation has succeeded in capitalising on the rich legacy of old buildings and historic canals in its area. It recognised from the outset the importance of improving the environment in order to unlock the regeneration opportunities and leisure potential, and to stimulate private sector investment. To that end, the corporation has spent some £17 million on environmental improvements, such as clearing canals, restoring towpaths and putting in new landscaping. Much of that work has been in the Castlefield area, which has been transformed into a major leisure and tourist attraction based around the historic canal network. Attractions include the Granada studios tour—for which my daughter, a fan of some of their productions, has booked—the museum of science and industry; a new youth hostel which has already attracted 8,500 visitors, over half of whom are from abroad; an outdoor events arena and a visitors' centre. The environmental improvement works undertaken by the corporation have helped to restore confidence among private sector investors and have greatly improved the overall image of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corporation has also succeeded in stimulating new jobs and businesses. Many underused buildings have been converted into quality offices and hotels, of varying sizes, and large new prestigious offices have been built. The corporation has attracted expanding companies from within and outside Manchester. Since it started its work, more than 98,000 sq m of offices have opened or are under way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community programmes have been another important part of the corporation's business. It has, for example, contributed to schemes to upgrade job skills, to help to make people more litter conscious, and to provide facilities for disabled youngsters. It has been concerned to work with people of all ages and from all walks of life, and to help strengthen the management of voluntary bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the CMDC has been a success. It has restored the confidence of private sector investors, stimulated new jobs and homes and provided a cleaner, safer environment. The influence and successes of the corporation have been instrumental in the formulation
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
of wider strategies for the continued urban renaissance of the city, and in the development of initiatives such as city pride. Under that initiative, the Government invited the local authorities in Manchester, Birmingham and London to bring together public and private sector interests to develop a strategy for their cities over the next 10 years. The corporation has played a key role in producing Manchester's prospectus, which will have wide-ranging benefits for the whole community. The corporation has also helped the city's successful bid to host the Commonwealth games.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Manchester can be especially proud of the corporation's achievements. Many parts of central Manchester that in 1988 were neglected and decaying are today making a vital contribution to a city that has found a new confidence and a new vision for its future. That done, it is right to wind up the corporation, and that is why the order is necessary. I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Vaz 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leicester, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by welcoming you to the Chair, Sir John. I do not intend to speak for long, because the Minister covered in detail the history of the Central Manchester development corporation. We do not oppose the order. We support the winding up of the corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that my hon. Friends the Members for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Eastham) and for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) are in Committee. I know that they will have contributions to make because, unlike other members of the Committee, they have direct knowledge of the corporation's activities and will be able to describe what has been achieved. I see the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Sumberg) nodding, which suggests that he, too, has direct knowledge. I am not sure what that is; perhaps he will catch your eye, Sir John.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Sumberg 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bury, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I shall take him on a tour of the Manchester area. My constituency is in the north of the region, not far from the city centre. Many of my constituents use the facilities there and benefit greatly from them. Perhaps we shall be able to welcome the hon. Gentleman to the north-west and explain to him why areas of Greater Manchester are so interconnected and well serviced, and why it is important to the people whom I represent for me to be in Committee this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that hon. Members are grateful to the hon. Gentleman for telling us those important facts. I was supposed to attend a dinner party in Manchester at 7.30 this evening. However, I felt that I could not make both the dinner party and the three-line Whip at 7 o'clock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, I received an excellent brochure that the development corporation had produced, and a covering letter from the chairman, who is observing our proceedings. I replied and said that I wanted to visit the corporation, only to discover two weeks later that the Government had decided to wind it up. I hope, however, that I shall be able to see the corporation's achievements in the next few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Most of the development corporations that were set up 10 years ago are nearing the end of their lifetimes. The Labour party has an advanced regeneration policy, which differs markedly from that of the Government. In the 1980s, regeneration policies were based on piecemeal reforms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and I were present when the Leeds and Bristol development corporations were wound up. We shall be left with a vacuum. A great deal of public money has been spent on the corporations—£86 million has been invested in the DMDC; more than £2 billion in docklands. Expectations have been raised in the 14 development corporations. The Government's cut in funding for regeneration means that those expectations, and the excellent work of the development corporations cannot be fulfilled by the local authorities that will take on the corporations' responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, there will be a cut in funding to Manchester. As the hon. Member for Bury, South said, his constituents have benefited from the funding that the Government granted the development corporation. The local authority is under pressure because of cuts in Government expenditure. The development corporation's work has raised expectations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We favour a regeneration scheme that will bring together three partners—the local authority, the private sector and the voluntary sector—in a new body, which we have called the civic forum. The scheme will enable the work of development corporations and local councils to continue. Regeneration is not simply a function of the local authority; it must encompass the great interests that exists in the private sector. One of Manchester's significant recent achievements is its attraction of private sector support for its work. The development corporation's achievements are mirrored by the work of Manchester city council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manchester is again a world-class city. That status has been achieved in the teeth of the Government's policies, which tried to restrict the way in which the council wanted to develop locally. More could have been achieved had the Government been willing to assist councils such as Manchester.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give one example—the civic pride initiative. Manchester was selected as one of the councils for the initiative. A detailed vision statement was produced with the help of my hon. Friends. But there was no funding to realise the vision. Everything comes down to money in the end. Will the Minister make a commitment to grant to the successor body the money that was previously available to the development corporation? Will the local authority benefit from the same funding that was given to the development corporation in the past 10 years? If so, I guarantee that the development corporation's achievements will be mirrored in future by a council that works with the private and voluntary sectors and is prepared to spend money for the benefit of local people. I look forward to receiving a commitment from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A tremendous amount of expertise has been developed in urban development corporations throughout Britain. Talented people have served not only on the boards of these corporations but as their
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
officers. Exit strategies have been devised to ensure that those who have development expertise are not lost to the regeneration industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can spend some time—I am happy to do this in the spirit of co-operation with the Government—in discussions with the Minister so that we might take regeneration policies out of party politics. We could ensure that the achievements of the past few years at a local level are developed and that the expertise that has accrued will not be lost. The next orders will be about Sheffield and then we shall go on to Tyne and Wear, and finally to docklands. When we get rid of those organisations—perhaps a better term is when they come to the end of their natural life—we should not lose the benefits that they have achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Donald Thompson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Calder Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the kind, generous and true words of the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) about the Central Manchester development corporation. He seems to forget, however, that it was development corporations that brought into sharper focus what local government should have been doing and was failing to achieve in the early 1980s. All that he and my hon. Friend the Minister have said has emphasised that the development corporations have done a good job in that sharp focus. At the same time, they have broadened their net and the range of people who are willing to contribute to sensible schemes that will take us into the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to hear that the hon. Member for Leicester, East was going to a dinner party in the north of England. I thought that new Labour went only to dinner parties in the north of London. I was glad to hear his new Labour appreciation of development corporations. That was not always the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To show how new Labour has developed, I should explain that the dinner party is in the constituency of the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton), although I would have had to go to Manchester first to get there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My constituency is on the borders of Yorkshire and Lancashire, and the first real joining of those counties was the canal. In 1990, the chairman of the Central Manchester development corporation and I got together to discuss the possibilities of reopening the Rochdale canal. As a result, a high-level working party was set up to prove the importance of the reopening of the canal in the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The development corporation was quicker and more adroit than the local councils, but the working party was set up. It consisted of councillors, senior officers from Calderdale, Rochdale, Oldham, Manchester city council and representation from the Rochdale canal trust, the Rochdale canal company and Leeds development corporation, where the canal also has an important face.

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
All the parties contributed to a study of the costs and benefits of the reopening of the Rochdale canal prepared by Ecotech Research and Consulting Ltd. The study was published in 1991 and a summary of the leaflet was prepared. The complete study has been of assistance to Calderdale and to the Government in reestablishing the Rochdale canal and curing a major blockage that occurred on the edge of my constituency at Tuel lane in Sowerby Bridge. That was funded not by European grant but by derelict land grant. The study set the Government's mind working on other more imaginative ways to use and interpret derelict land grant. The whole of my part of the canal, as it were, from the Yorkshire border has been regenerated with funds directly from the Government, except, occasionally, old mills on the riverside which have received European funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I place on record my thanks to the chairman, Dr. Grigor, who talked to me about the matter in the bar—where else would he talk to me? He acted promptly, quickly and successfully and I extend grateful thanks to him and to the development corporation on behalf of my constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Eastham 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Blackley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I extend my thanks to the chairman and the board for their work on behalf of the city. I shall not be so churlish as to say that they did not achieve anything; they did, because the Government were kind enough to give them the money to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unreasonable to imply that the local authority was not doing things and that that is why the Government set in place the machinery in 1988. The local authorities have been cash-starved year after year. They have lost about £1 million a week in rate support grant and I can understand the financial difficulties suffered by the city as a result. We are grateful for the Government's handout of £86 million, and we will apply ourselves to the task in hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman was very kind and invited local Members of Parliament on visits, during which we discussed the projects and admired the efforts made on the city's behalf. We are grateful for the new housing as there is a serious shortage of modern housing. The city wanted to build houses, but the Government did not permit the local authority to do so, which is why there is such a terrible shortage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, the £17 million for improvements in the environment is desperately needed. An old city suffers because of obsolescence. A shrinking population living in the suburbs has the benefits of the city but invariably pays nothing towards its upkeep. The hon. Member for Bury, South said that he and his constituents know the city very well and visit it frequently, but their rate contributions to it are zero. The burden falls on the city's residents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the same in respect of industry. I was a Manchester city councillor before I became a Member of Parliament; Manchester was successful before this initiative, as it always has been. A classic example is that it has probably the finest airport in the country. It was a local authority enterprise—independent of the development corporation—and is second to none;
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
nowhere, including London, can compare in terms of the quality, efficiency and standard of that airport. The Government have their eyes on it and may want to sell off that ratepayers' asset, which would be strongly denounced. Other industrial developments show the local authority's determination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the area was neglected, but the professional officers in Manchester town hall are able people who are ready, willing and competent to carry out the schemes; they simply did not have the money to do so. The Government should have been fair in the past and allocated moneys to the city. I know that from my experience many years ago as chairman of planning in Manchester for three or four years, when we tried to initiate various projects for the environment, the university campus and roads. We were often frustrated because we never had enough money. We knew that the right type of investment would engender other developments from industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manchester serves a region rather than just the citizens of Manchester. We are entitled to receive from the Government some additional funding to face up to the obsolescence that a city is bound to suffer over the years. The local authorities will continue to need support. The corporation has done its job well in one area, because the money was there. The officers and the board have received full co-operation from city councillors and the general public. I now make a plea through you, Sir John, that Ministers should not say that the job is finished and all Manchester's problems have been solved. The local authorities are entitled to consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should support the local authorities with moneys of the order of those given to the corporation. Having said that, I congratulate the corporation once again and I offer sincere thanks for all the work that it has done. Now let us look to the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. David Sumberg 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bury, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said when I intervened on the hon. Member for Leicester, East, my constituents have an interest, because they live close to the area covered by the corporation. I take issue with the hon. Member for Blackley, because my constituents make a considerable contribution to the city of Manchester. Many of them work or have their businesses there, and they make an effective contribution to the life of the city. They are not freeloaders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, congratulate the corporation on the excellent work that it has done during its eight years. One has only to visit the places described by the Minister to see what it has achieved. The amenities are used, valued and enjoyed by all who come to Manchester. I pay tribute to the executive team and the board members, some of whom I have known for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention particularly the deputy chairman, Derek Boothman, because I knew him from my life as a solicitor in Manchester. I also mention Joyce Hill because we served together on Manchester city council. I suppose that I should also include Graham Stringer, who was quoted as saying that the corporation was in danger of giving quangos a good name—I would say
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
that the corporation was in danger of giving Manchester city council a good name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make one slightly more controversial point. The hon. Member for Blackley was fair enough to congratulate the Government on providing the money for the corporation, but he should recognise why it was necessary in 1988 for that funding to go through a development corporation. In those days, Manchester city council was a byword for extremism. It was regarded as incompetent, unsatisfactory and performing a grave disservice to the people who lived in the city or used its services. It was undoubtedly in the control of the loony left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that had the Government at that time chosen to provide the council with the sort of funding that went to the corporation, most of the people in Manchester would have found that entirely unsatisfactory, because they would have known that the money would not be used to provide such valuable benefits for the whole community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eastham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman makes reference to the competence of the city council, he should recognise the existence of democracy and the ballot box. Year after year, there is an overwhelming vote in support of the city council, which is not for the hon. Gentleman's party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sumberg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the existence of the ballot, but it does not remove my entitlement to criticise the council. There was a ballot in 1992 in which a Conservative Government were elected by the biggest ever popular vote. That has not inhibited the hon. Gentleman or any other Opposition Member for criticising the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I say in relation to the brickbats that have rained on the Government over the corporation is that one must remember why the money was channelled in the way that it was in 1988. The history is important. The future is equally important. We have a record of success. The Opposition have paid tribute to that. I hope that the Government will find a way to work with all sectors—the council, the private sector and the people of Manchester—to ensure that the work that has been done will continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.11 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise with some amusement after hearing the hon. Member for Bury, South. He paid tribute to the development corporation, but offered rather an unusual history of its genesis. I join the unanimity of the Committee in paying tribute to the corporation's work; the city of Manchester is a better-looking, better-serviced city because of the actions of the parties that came together under the development corporation. This is no churlish tribute: central Government played its part as did the local authority, the private sector and other parts of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The development corporation's significance was in its ability to mobilise the talents and abilities of people across a broad spectrum of city life. Like the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Member for Bury, South, I was in this place when the corporation was set up and I should remind him that another was set up in Trafford Park, next to the one in central Manchester. If his comments about a loony left council in Manchester are justified, members of the then Conservative council in Trafford would be surprised at the hon. Gentleman's indictment of them. Now that the Conservative group of Manchester city council has decreased in number to two out of 99 councillors—a creditable performance given how little the Conservatives have to offer the city—the Conservative majority at Trafford has also been whittled away so that it is now hung, with the Labour party taking on principal responsibility. There is something in that for everyone except the hon. Member for Bury, South.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the corporation was set up, it was recognised that central and local government were not focusing attention on the problems of urban dereliction and that resulted in great cost to communities such as that in Manchester. It is almost pointless to lay political blame for that and better to recognise that there are better ways to proceed. The degree of focus that the development corporation brought was required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not say that a development corporation is the ideal solution in all circumstances. It is necessary sometimes to recognise that that kind of focus has a limited life, as the Government have recognised. I agree with the vision of my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East who outlined a better way of bringing together the differing talents of different parts of the community. It is important to look to the future, particularly in a city such as Manchester, which has benefited in some areas, but which still has a huge amount of dereliction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both my hon. Friends who have spoken have pointed out the importance of future development. As we have had £86 million spent over the past eight years on one specific area, I ask the Minister to come to the city and on a tour of the areas that still need attention from central Government and still need the resources that only the Government can bring to bear. The Minister was right to mention the ability of central Government, local government and the development corporation to put in public resources that can attract private resources. We need to see that same combination of private sector and public sector investment in those huge areas of the city that still suffer from dereliction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Blackley, other Manchester Members and I still represent some of the most outrageous pockets of poverty in the country. Some of my constituents are desperately poor and are locked into that poverty by lack of opportunity in both their housing conditions and their physical environment, which should allow the investment in the jobs and the industry of the future. We need some guarantees about the future of investment. I hope that the Minister can begin to give us those answers today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister a specific question about the process of handing over any residual responsibilities of the development corporation. He referred to the fact that many of those functions revert to the existing local authorities. I do not know the exact financial position, but I hope that there is a mechanism by which moneys that have been allocated to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
development corporation, and schemes that are still transitional, will be handed on so that there is no arbitrary interruption of the actions that the development corporation might have wanted to complete had it continued beyond this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his little tour of our two famous counties, the hon. Member for Calder Valley (Sir D. Thompson) said that he thought that Lancashire and Yorkshire were first joined by the Rochdale canal. When Yorkshire stole huge amounts of land from John of Gaunt it laid the foundations for the enmity that lasted a few hundred years, long before the canal brought us into the uneasy but nevertheless warm truce that has prevailed ever since. I think that the hon. Member would freely admit that our relations go back considerably before the canal. They will continue long after the last canal ceases to have any commercial function, but still operates as a source of beauty and as a leisure facility for all our communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that Manchester today is a dynamic city. It is a city of which Mancunians are proud: I am extremely proud of my city and I tell people that it is a massively better city in the 1990s than it has been throughout my lifetime. That is a tribute to all those, including the development corporation, who have worked on that. But we must look to a future which can sustain the kind of activity and interest that the development corporation has brought to bear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Manchester look to both central Government and local government to maintain those actions. The Minister said that the number of people living in the area of the development corporation area had increased from 200 to some 4,000. As I will be knocking on those doors at the next general election to ask them to cast their vote in a rational way for the future of Manchester, I am glad to have the exact numbers from the Minister. As people in many cities are delighted to see, this has brought people back into the city. Our cities are no longer just seen as places that die at night. It is important to create a city as a whole entity and not simply as a sector that operates only for certain specific activities. That is part of bringing the city alive and bringing the future back into the heart of the city. That is certainly what has taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The development corporation goes, but the future is in front of us. The development corporation deserves the bouquets it has received today from us all. They are well meant. But I hope that the Minister will take away our message that we also want the same kind of vision for the future that he can properly say his Government have contributed to in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.20 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted. I think that everyone will understand why all hon. Members who have spoken and who all know the area accept that the development corporation has done a huge job under difficult circumstances. The hon. Member for Stretford pointed out that it was action by all parties that explains that success. To some degree that backs the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South, but not necessarily for this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference in approach between the hon. Member for Leicester, East and myself builds on the success of development corporations such as Central Manchester. Manchester council has been building on that as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked about the future. The future must involve partnership and bringing in the private sector, following on and utilising the expertise that has developed. Indeed, the expertise from these development corporations and similar organisations has moved into the private sector, into local government and into other projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give a few pointers about Manchester's future. There is the Hulme city challenge into which £37.5 million has gone; £75 million has gone towards the Olympics; another £18 million has gone to Moss Side and Hulme SRB. We have received some applications for SRB relating to city pride. This development corporation is a fine example of the approach which the Government made in the early days. It has been extremely successful and it is one that we have built on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today we have given some accolades. Considerable work has been undertaken by the members and the staff of the Central Manchester development corporation over the last eight years. It has been an enormous effort which has been enormously successful. It has brought in partners who have been a key part of it. But the time has now come to wind up the corporation after an extremely successful period, and I therefore commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
