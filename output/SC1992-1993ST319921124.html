	<p>10.31 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Dorrell)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) has taken the words out of my mouth. So anxious is he to preserve his position in this morning's debate that he wanted to be the first to record the Committee's congratulations to you, Dr. Blackburn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Guyana) Order 1992.</p></blockquote>
The background to the double taxation arrangements between Britain and Guyana is as follows. Arrangements were concluded in 1947, but they lapsed in 1971 when Guyana became independent. Following independence, there was spasmodic interest in the re-establishment of the double taxation regime between the two countries, interest which was seriously taken up in 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the existing arrangements for negotiating double taxation, the Inland Revenue undertakes discussions directly with the other country and drafts a treaty to be submitted to Ministers for approval. Once approved, it is tabled in the House and comes into effect by delegated authority under the provisions of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 when the Privy Council makes an order that it should take effect. The Act also requires a prayer in the House before such an order is brought into effect. That is why we are here this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Inland Revenue has produced such a double taxation treaty. It was signed in Georgetown on 31 August 1992. It has been submitted for approval, which has been granted. It was tabled in the House on 6 November and we must now debate the prayer that the treaty be brought into effect. If it is given effect, it will join a body of more than 100 double taxation treaties between this and other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East will have studied the terms of the treaty and discovered that it defines the terms necessary to understand the double taxation arrangements. It itemises different types of income, including capital gains, and allocates the taxing rights for different types of income between the two contracting parties. It provides arrangements to avoid double taxation of classes of income to which taxation rights are shared between the two contracting parties. The treaty is based on model arrangements published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Development. It will greatly assist trade and investment between Britain and Guyana. One might even say that it is a very important measure for those who are involved in trade and investment with Guyana. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.35 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary was right to stress the importance of the treaty and, in doing so, he has set out the method by which double taxation treaties, of which there are more than 100, are dealt with by the House. The Committee must scrutinise the treaty and report back to the House, so this is the forum in which such matters are scrutinised in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Government wish to make greater use of Committees such as this to examine financial legislation: not only double taxation treaties, but other matters that have hitherto been dealt with in Committee on the Finance Bill. Opposition Members are somewhat anxious about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The treaty with Guyana replaces the previous treaty, which was negotiated in 1947 and terminated by Guyana in 1971. If I may borrow a phrase from the Financial Secretary, the agreement is an evolution of Guyana's policy on double taxation treaties with us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary said that the double taxation convention with Guyana is comprehensive. It covers a range of topics, including capital gains tax and corporation tax, but it is not as comprehensive as the Financial Secretary states. Of course the treaty covers capital gains tax and corporation tax—it would have a gaping hole if it did not—but it also covers a range of personal incomes, business profits, dividends and interest, directors' and other fees and so on, and it includes an article on the elimination of double taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot, however, find in the treaty any reference to article 22 of the OECD model convention, which covers capital. In a comprehensive treaty such as this, I would have expected to find something closely parallel to the model convention, but I cannot. The Committee is probably familiar with the OECD model convention on double taxation treaties, and I do not doubt that Conservative Members can recite all its articles by rote. For those who cannot, it may be helpful if I outline the contents of article 22 on the taxation of capital:
	<br><blockquote><p>"1. Capital represented by immovable property referred to in Article 6, owned by a resident of a Contracting State and situtated in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>2. Capital represented by movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State or by movable property pertaining to a fixed base available to a resident of a Contracting State in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing independent personal services, may be taxed in that other State."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 3 refers specifically to
	<br><blockquote><p>"ships and aircraft operated in international traffic and by boats engaged in inland waterways transport, and by movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships"</p></blockquote>
Shipping is covered by a separate article, although it might have been covered by incorporation of the OECD model article 22 on the taxation of capital. The fact that the treaty does not include the model article verbatim does not mean that at least some of the matters are not covered by it. Indeed, I suspect that some of them are. Other parts of the treaty appear to deal with some of those points although
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
they do so in a way different from that recommended by the OECD. Why have the Government agreed to a treaty phrased differently from the OECD model?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article in the treaty which deals specifically with shipping and air transport is not worded in precisely the same language as that recommended by the OECD. There are a number of possible reasons for that. The key difference is that article 9 of the order states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Profits derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State."</p></blockquote>
It goes on with a definition that seems more restrictive than the OECD's recommended one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Gold dredging is one of the pillars of the Guyanan economy. The ownership of the dredgers, which may be owned by international companies rather than those registered purely in Guyana, may have been a consideration in the drafting of some craft trade with Venezuela up the Pomeroon river; perhaps the ownership of those vessels is covered by the treaty and is a matter for special consideration. I am sure that the Financial Secretary will have something to say about that and about the sort of cargo which those craft carry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Treaties of this kind attempt to prevent fraud and the evasion of customs or other dues, and to deal with illicit trade. No doubt the Financial Secretary will assure us that the legitimate interests of the Guyana and British Exchequers will be fully protected by article 9 of the treaty even though it departs from the wording recommended in article 22 of the OECD model convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the Financial Secretary is looking perplexed. I should have expected him to have at his fingertips enough information about trading patterns on the Pomeroon river and about the main Venezuelan exports to Guyana to allow him to intervene spontaneously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 12 deals with the taxation of interest—no small matter. Article 12(7) is a non-standard clause. I am sure that there are special reasons why the Government decided to word article 12(7) to (11) as they have. Their objective is not exceptional and the Opposition do not object to it. We should however, like the Government to tell us why they have tried to achieve those objectives by the arrangements set out in the treaty. The arrangements are not standard. They might refer to something specific in relation to trading relationships between Britain and Guyana or, perhaps the Government of Guyana asked for some special requirement to be met. I would understand if that were the case, but some explanation should be offered to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I am sure the Financial Secretary will tell us in a moment, the purpose of article 12(7) to (11) is to avoid double taxation. Indeed, that theme runs through the treaty. As such, it is not objectionable. It deals with the treatment of distribution. Yet the issue is similar to that covered by clauses 51 and 52 of this year's Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Government's approach in the treaty is the opposite to that adopted in the Finance Bill. I would be the first to acknowledge that there is more than one approach to a problem, but I should like to hear the Government's justification for taking an approach, which, as I am sure the Financial Secretary will concede, is inconsistent with their approach to the same issue in the Finance Bill. Perhaps that approach will block a potential loophole, but it is the opposite to deciding that interest cannot be treated as a
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
distribution and the implication of article 12 is that it can. That may have something to do with the structure of businesses in Guyana. I look forward to hearing the Financial Secretary's explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 12(11) of the order may be specific to Guyana and act as a qualification of the other paragraphs. Alternatively, the Financial Secretary may argue that article 12(9) covers that point and is intended to act as a qualifying section. If that is the explanation, I understand it, although I again draw to the attention of the Committee—particularly to those members of the Committee who sat through the Finance Bill—the inconsistency of the Government's approach. The Opposition do not oppose the objective of article 12(7) to (11) but seek clarification of the Government's aims. Without some provision of this sort, the arrangements might create opportunities for what charitable Government members call tax planning and what the Opposition refer to as tax avoidance or tax evasion. It is not unreasonable for the Government to make arrangements to cover such matters. It is necessary that they justify those arrangements and I invite the Financial Secretary to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from gold dredging and trade with Venezuela, to which I referred earlier, agricultural trade is Guyana's mainstay. Sugar and rice, important export commodities, will be governed by the arrangements set out in the treaty. I am not aware of the structure of the businesses that deal in those main exports, but if they are international, rather than national, companies and if some of them are British-owned, they will benefit substantially from a treaty to deal with the taxation of whatever profits they make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that such companies have every bit as much to gain from the GATT round as they do from the double taxation treaty, and I can understand why the Guyanan Government seem to have adopted—I was going to say an evolution of their previous policy of not agreeing to the free market—a policy of agreeing to the free market. That evolution will be to the advantage of those who trade internationally with Guyana and those who own institutions which trade with Guyana.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that some of the points that I have made are matters of detail. I would not want it to be thought that we are carping or not being constructive about the treaty. We wish the treaty well and support the principles that underpin it, but because the Committee represents the only forum in the House for scrutinising such matters, I think it important that we be fully satisfied that the treaty does what it is supposed to before we return it to the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Financial Secretary's attention to article 9. Is he satisfied that the arrangements set out there to deal with air transport and shipping do not proved a potential loss to the British Exchequer in the area of flagging out? I refer to the possibility of the ownership of airline fleets or, perhaps more plausibly, shipping fleets, being onshore in Guyana with no fully reciprocal obligations to Great Britain? I presume that that happens with double taxation treaties that Guyana has made with other powers—most likely the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The OECD model convention is quite specific on those points, and I am worried that the treaty adopts a different approach more specific to the special needs of Guyana.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having explored these issues with the Committee, and having clearly excited much interest among Conservative Members. I shall let the Financial Secretary respond. I shall return to the issues later, if that proves necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>10.53 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raised three substantial issues arising from the treaty. The first concerns article 22 of the OECD model and the question of why there is no provision in the treaty to match that article, which governs double incidence of capital taxes. The answer is simple: there is no prospect of the double incidence of capital taxes in any country bilateral with the United Kingdom—for the not-very-difficult reason that the United Kingdom does not impose capital taxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But does Guyana?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not certain, but there is no prospect of double taxation arising bilaterally between the two countries, because this country does not impose capital taxes. The treaty is concerned not with the Guyanan tax regime, but with avoiding double taxation. Because we do not have a capital taxes system, there cannot be double taxation, whatever the regime is in Guyana. I have just been assured that Guyana does not tax capital either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman asked about the definition in the treaty of the taxing rights arising from shipping and aircraft. We have long preferred to base taxing rights for shipping and aircraft on the residence of a company, not on the OECD formation, which relies on effective management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question about the difference between this treaty and the OECD model was given by his own further question about flagging out. It is clearly more difficult to relocate the residence of a company than the effective management of a company. That is part of the reason why, for taxing rights, we prefer residence to effective management. The treaty, therefore, reflects our preferred formulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Mandelson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hartlepool)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that residence is more important and that the Government prefer residence to effective management. Will he explain to the Committee what he means by residence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may know that, in English law, the question of residence of a company is one that has detained lawyers for a much longer time than the Committee has at its disposal. I do not propose, therefore, to engage in a detailed definition, but if the hon. Gentleman would like to see the definition for the purposes of this treaty he should look at article 4 of the treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third issue raised by the hon. Gentleman concerned the article covering interest and the arrangement of circumstances in which an interest payment from one country to another is or is not treated as a distribution. The article covering interest provides, as a derogation from the domestic law of both countries, that interest paid by one company to another should not be regarded as a distribution, except when one company is a SO per cent subsidiary of another. The concerns—we discussed them in this year's Finance Bill—about the potential use of interest payments as a means of tax avoidance apply most when one company is a 50 per cent subsidiary of another. That is why domestic law is retained in such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We and the Guyanese have sufficient confidence in our respective tax regimes to say that, where there is not a 50 per cent subsidiary relationship, there should be a derogation from the usual terms of domestic law, which
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
provide that an interest payment outside this country can be taxed as a distribution. I hope that I have answered directly the three points that the hon. Gentleman properly raised concerning this important treaty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.58 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister was speaking about the question of residence, I was prompted to ask a question which in turn was prompted by the cuttings from various newspapers that his Department kindly sent Committee Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was me!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was it? I was wondering why the Government were being unnaturally helpful. I pay tribute to the thoughtfulness of my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to enter into double taxation relief agreements, which I think everyone agrees is desirable, we ought to be satisfied as to the nature of the countries with which we are entering into them. My hon. Friend has drawn my attention to several articles in the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> and 
	<i>The Economist</i> which suggest that Guyana has had some difficulties with its democratic process. On its election day there were one or two incidents which give cause for concern. I would argue that there are difficulties in any country whither it is necessary to send 100 foreign observers to scrutinise an election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we examine the provisions that the Finance Secretary has just mentioned, which relate in particular to residence—particularly article 4(2)(a)—we note that an individual "shall be deemed to be a resident of the Contracting State in which he has a permanent home available to him; if he has a permanent home available to him in both Contracting States, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the Contracting State with which his personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests)".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to presuppose that a Government structure exists in Guyana which can determine such issues. There is no way in which the Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom can have any idea of what conditions are like in parts of Guyana or can determine whether an individual who claims that his centre of vital interest is in Guyana and not here is telling the truth. I do not want people to use these treaties—and I am not sufficiently familiar with the Guyanan tax regime to say that this could happen—to avoid or evade tax and leave the Inland Revenue none the wiser.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that my hon. Friend has mentioned article 4 and the difficulties that can occur when the legal and casework structures which would enable determination of some of these questions do not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw my hon. Friend's attention to article 4(2)(d), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if he is a national of both Contracting States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement."</p></blockquote>
That implies some form of equality between the systems to allow for such a difficult determination to be made. Can my hon. Friend elaborate on that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is several years since I studied public international law and several years since I last had occasion to refresh my memory from the text books as to how such matters are decided. I am sure that other hon. Members might like to develop that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Financial Secretary tell us how, in practice, the Inland Revenue deals with such matters? It is all very well to say that there ought to be mutual agreement. Does that mean that, rather than waste time, the Revenue says, "Okay, we shall treat this individual as taxable in Guyana or the United Kingdom, for the sake of argument."? What sort of discussions occur?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to be sure in the case of Guyana and, indeed, any other country with which we enter into such an agreement, that structures exist in which we have absolute confidence. The articles to which my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East drew the Committee's attention tend to suggest that the formalities that one would expect from an established Government do not exist in Guyana.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that Guyana has had difficulties and has recently held elections. I have no very recent reports, but a new Government have been elected and may well be making substantial progress. All hon. Members are aware that developing countries experience certain difficulties. While we are keen to assist them with the practicalities of individual taxation, we must nevertheless be sure that we have absolute confidence in the tax regime and the taxation authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure how much money is at stake, although I suppose that the Inland Revenue will not have to deal with many people. Can the Financial Secretary tell us how many individuals he anticipates being affected by the treaty? Can he also say a word or two about the earlier parts of the treaty, particularly about income and corporation tax?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was examining the corporation tax regime and the definition of a commercial company: a company at least 75 per cent. of whose gross income is derived from trading in goods that it does not manufacture. Presumably a noncommercial company has a different definition. What type of tax authorities in Guyana can make those distinctions; and what allowances can be set against goods in determining whether a company is commercial or noncommercial? The tax rate, after all, is significantly different—75 per cent. as opposed to 25 per cent.—and the same applies to income tax and capital gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any country, tax regimes are quite elaborate. In this country, vast shoals of accountants make a fortune advising people how best to mitigate their tax position and to avoid tax, as they are entitled to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the situation in Guyana? Does Guyana have a developed system of accountancy? Do we see Price Waterhouse and Coopers and Lybrand swimming across the sea to make their livings in Guyana.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want the Minister to regard these considerations as idle. As my hon. Friend has said, there are many of these treaties and they should not be entered into lightly, simply as a formality, just because it may be convenient for the Revenue. I am surprised that the Minister did not tell us something about the regime in Guyana. He almost seemed to think that we should nod through this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
I think that if Parliament has decided that this kind of agreement should come into force only by means of the affirmative procedure, that implies room for doubt. On occasion, it is open to the Committee to say, "Not on this occasion."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those from Guyana who follow such proceedings, I stress that I am in no way trying to criticise that country. I openly confess that I know little about it, however, and I think I am entitled to ask what the situation there is. I intend no slight on the Government or the people of that country but, when it comes to the United Kingdom, we have to consider our own situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell us something of the current situation in Guyana? The information that I have about Guyana is about two months out of date and I am not able to follow developments in that part of the world in as much detail as I would like. I would also like some guidance on the question of residence. The Minister should know or, at least, he could be told by those who sit behind him, that even in the United Kingdom and in very developed economies, lawyers are similar to accountants in that they are good at arguing about such points at some length, to their own professional and financial advantage. It is important, therefore, to known about the legal system and the tax regime in Guyana.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could take any single article in the treaty and develop the same argument at some length. Mine is the same argument that my hon. Friend the Minister for Newcastle upon Tyne, East tried to apply to shipping and transport, and royalties and dividends. We need to know more than the Minister has told us before we ratify what I regard as a wholly desirable aim. I agree with double taxation treaties but I do not think that they should be agreed to on the nod.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mandelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) has said about the care that we should all take to avoid seeming to criticise the legal, financial and accounting systems in a country such as Guyana. Guyana, in common with similar countries, is not at the same stage of political, economic and financial development as our own. That is an observation, not a criticism. Having lived for a year in Tanzania, a country not unlike Guyana, I know at first hand something of the problems that such countries have in formulating arrangements and developing structures and system that can incorporate a set of arrangements dealing with an issue such as double taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to make this point, because people read our proceedings, and it is not my intention to cast aspersions on Guyana—certainly not on its democratic credentials, its stability or the state of its financial and accounting institutions. If anything, I would be more inclined to be sympathetic and generous to Guyana because I note that it is a co-operative republic. I assume, therefore, that it is a country whose institutions and outlook are ones to which I would be sympathetic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central made a reasonable point about the republic's stability and hence about what we might expect of the stability of its financial accounting arrangements. The order states that the competent authority in Guyana is the Minister of Finance. In the United Kingdom, the competent authority is the Inland Revenue—its commissioners or its authorised
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
representatives. The exchange of notes on page 14 of the order show that although the Minister of Finance in Guyana is the competent authority, he has not signed the exchange of notes. That demonstrates in a small way that questions should be asked about the continuity of the arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Winston Murray signed the Guyanan note in Georgetown on 31 August. We know that since 31 August there has been an election in Guyana, the Government have changed and there is a new president whose election I welcome. Not only did the Minister of Finance not sign the note but, since it was signed, a new Minister of Finance has, presumably, been appointed. I do not know who he is or who, therefore, is the competent authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That highlights the validity of the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary asked me to explore and understand the issue of residency by reading article 4 of the Order. I have done that and I am struck by the enormous difficulty in concluding who is a resident of what and where. My hon. Friend mentioned the elections and the political instability which has been a characteristic of Guyana. I do not know whether that political instability will continue or what the implications are following the change of presidency. As we in Britain experienced with the poll tax, residency is easily, quickly and reliably defined in the electoral register. It is easy for us to go to the town hall, or wherever, to look up a name and address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An article in 
	<i>The Economist</i> on 19 September 1992, in reference to the forthcoming general election in Guyana, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The National Assembly's five-year term finished in December 1990",—</p></blockquote>
an important point—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Since then, there have been two postponed elections, two special extensions to the life of parliament, two election commissions, and two dud voter lists (the second of which in November last year, was one-third inaccurate)."</p></blockquote>
That was stated by 
	<i>The Economist,</i> not by some rag or less than highball source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Financial Secretary refers me to the simple way of identifying residence, he should bear in mind that that is more simply done here, where there is an authoritative and reliable electoral register, than in Guyana, according to 
	<i>The Economist.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have also had the opportunity to study article 4(2)(b), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the Contracting State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he has no permanent home available to him in either Contracting State, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the Contracting State in which he has an habitual abode".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend has outlined the difficulties of defining abode in the United Kingdom, and that article may give him even greater cause for concern about the interpretation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mandelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point. I shall draw on my experience of living in a country similar to Guyana. What constitutes an habitual abode is very much in the eye of the beholder; it is a transient phenomenon. An habitual abode for a citizen of Guyana may be similar to the abodes of the citizens among whom I lived in the republic of Tanzania. An obode is the place where someone happens to be resting at a specific moment. It may be where someone is able to
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
throw together some sticks and stones and a loosely constructed roof under which to rest for a few days or months. That is someone's abode while he is resting there; it is his place of residence, albeit a short-term residence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is probably asking a little too much of the authorities in Guyana to expect them to provide us with a definition of residence or habitual abode when people tend to move around and follow economic circumstances, which are often dependent on the season of the year and the nature of the climate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary referred me to article 4, which is improtant to our understanding of the order and of how the arrangements will operate in practice. That is the crux of the matter, as can be seen from the explanatory note.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Convention provides for business profits not arising through a permanent establishment to be taxed only in the country of the taxpayer's residence."</p></blockquote>
That is the crux of the order; it is a key to understanding how the arrangements will work in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4 deals with who is a resident. It provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this Convention, the term "resident of a Contracting State" means any person"—</p></blockquote>
this is the important part—
	<br><blockquote><p>"who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence"—</p></blockquote>
whatever domicile may be.
I have already shown that it depends on the season or month of the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order does not make clear the difference between domicile and residence. I defy any member of the Committee to try, but perhaps the Financial Secretary can tell us the difference. Article 4 continues: "place of management"—another ambiguous phrase—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or any other criterion of a similar nature."</p></blockquote>
The sky is the limit. Wherever a person chooses to make his bed and lay his bones, under the widest interpretation of the order, might constitute a criterion of "a similar nature".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4 continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The terms 'resident of the United Kingdom' and 'resident of Guyana' shall be construed accordingly."</p></blockquote>
Article 4(2) states that where an individual is a resident of both contracting states, his status shall be determined in accordance with a whole set of rules. Not only is it difficult to draw watertight conclusions about where a person's residence, or domicile is in the co-operative republic of Guyana—that is complicated enough—but there is the additional complication of people who are residents of both contracting states. Where is such a person assessed for taxation for the purposes of the order?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rule upon which the order elaborates tries to help, but I am not sure that it does. Article 4(2)(a) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"he shall be deemed to be a resident of the Contracting State in which he has a permanent home available to him".</p></blockquote>
What is "a permanent home"? What does "permanent" mean? It means fixed, unmoving; something that a person owns; and, of course, one can own two fixed dwellings in two different places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not very helpful to define one's residence as the place where one has a permanent home. Many Members of Parliament have two permanent homes. I certainly have two such homes, and I think that other members of the Committee have, too. I have a permanent home, which I would regard as my principal home, where I keep my goods, chatels, books and prized possessions, in my constituency of Hartlepool, where I live. I also have a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
permanent home that I use during the week, when I attend to my parliamentary duties. I own both homes. I know that only too well as I pay huge mortgages on each of them. So I know the definition of permanence only too well. I pay through the nose for the permanence of my two homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I defy anyone, using that analogy, to tell me which of those two homes is the permanent one. I do not think anyone could, because both homes are permanent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has helped me make my point.

The poll tax was politically, economically and socially suicidal. I am not making a point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, you are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mandelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister cannot follow my argument, I shall repeat it, for clarification. I am talking not about what is happening in this country but about Guyana. I know only too well how simple it is to find out where somebody lives in Britain, because I can go along and look at the electoral register. Where anybody lives in Britain is as plain as a pikestaff. I could even go back and look up the poll tax registers in my civic centre, if they have not been burnt on the nearest altar in memory of the flaming tax which caused such misery to my constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point relates to the differences between here and there. The order aims to help us to solve the dilemma of where an individual has two permanent homes when it is not possible to determine the principal as opposed to the permanent home. Had the order used slightly different language and tried to define a principal as opposed to a permanent home, it would be easier for us to understand the order's proposals, and how they will work in practice. The order does not offer such a definition. It merely refers to two permanent homes. The order does, however, try to take us a step further, aiming to develop the definition of a resident. Article 4(2)(a) states that the person will:
	<br><blockquote><p>"be deemed to be a resident of the Contracting State with which his personae and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests)".</p></blockquote>
With the best will in the world, I think that anyone would find it difficult to draw up criteria to provide a clear and understandable framework that would enable someone who is deeply immersed in and entirely familiar with his economic and business circumstances to determine where personal and economic relations are closer—someone who is not familiar with the economic circumstances or business arrangements of the individual would have even more trouble. What happens if an individual's personal relations point one way and his economic relations another?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All hon. Members can envisage circumstances in which an individual has two permanent homes in two different countries. His family, his friends, his wife—or her husband, if she is female—his country of origin, where he enjoys spending his leisure time and where his or her personal relations point may not necessarily be in the same country as his economic activity, relations and business orientation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
I shall take the analogy which I have previously offered to the Committee a step further: my personal ties are where I spend the bulk of my personal time and have my friends and that is in my home in Hartlepool—my constituency. That will come as no surprise to members of the Committee. Arguably, my economic relations and ties are not in Hartlepool because that is not strictly where I earn my living. I earn my living where I am employed and I am not employed in Hartlepool in the strictest sense, although I am employed on behalf of Hartlepool as the people have elected me to represent that constituency. I am employed formally at my place of work in London as opposed to my place of domicile. Therefore, article 4(2)(a) does not further the understanding of how the order might work or provide the best possible and most infallible definition of residency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If members of the Committee were to ask me where my centre of vital interests is, I would be hard put to say. In a sense, the people who have elected me where I live are most vital to me. On the other hand, the role that I am able to perform in my economic place, is vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4(2)(b) helps further:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the Contracting State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined"—</p></blockquote>
and I think that I showed quite persuasively how difficult it would be, although not impossible, to determine where a person's centre of vital interests is—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or if he has no permanent home available to him in either Contracting State, he shall be deemed"—</p></blockquote>
and this is crucial—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to be a resident to the Contracting State in which he has an habitual abode".</p></blockquote>
We have already referred to the difficulty of defining or drawing up strictly understandable criteria for describing an habitual abode. I have also said how people are frequently forced to make their habitual abode in different places at different times of the year as economic opportunity arises. Of all the definitions of residence contained in article 4, this is the most loose and flabby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the term "an habitual abode" is susceptible to accurate or consistent definition. It is open to ambiguity. People could discuss its meaning for hours and construct different versions of what it might mean to different people in different countries in different circumstances. Far from helping us to conclude what a residence is, the term is positively unhelpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it were possible—and I assume that it is not—to redraft the order, I would suggest that that term should be the first priority for reconsideration because it would create more fuss and bother than help and elucidation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order, having plunged us into this muddle, tries to lift us out of the mess of ambiguity and put us back on terra firma by stating in article 4(2)(c) that
	<br><blockquote><p>"if he has an habitual abode in both Contracting States …"—</p></blockquote>
if the person has two or more habitual abodes, whatever they are, in each of the Contracting States—
	<br><blockquote><p>"he shall be deemed to be a resident of the Contracting State of which he is a national".</p></blockquote>
With one passport per person, it should be unambiguous and straightforward to conclude of which state that person is a national.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the place of residence is not clear from where a person's home is, from where a person's economic relations take place, or from where a person's habitual abode may be, it could be determined by describing or eliciting a person's nationality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
A problem would arise if the person were a national of two contracting states, that is, a person with dual nationality. A friend of mine is a national of three countries—Britain, France and the United States of America. He has a profliferation of passports and I would be hard to state his nationality. Similar circumstances could occur when interpreting the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more I consider the order, the more it makes me wonder who drafted it. Article 4(2)(d) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"if he is a national of both Contracting States or of neither of them,"—</p></blockquote>
heaven knows where he or she may be a national—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement."</p></blockquote>
That provision prompts two questions: who reaches the mutual agreement, and what happens if that mutual agreement is not reached?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know who would agree in this country; we have a fairly clear set of arrangements by which a fairly clear group of people determine such matters. They are the commissioners of Inland Revenue and their staff, and they are a competent, well-resourced, experienced bunch of people. Some people may use other words to describe them, especially if they are on the harsh receiving end of their decisions. I am strictly neutral. Who reaches the conclusion? Where does mutuality begin and end? It ends not in this country where the Inland Revenue is but in the Co-operative Republic of Guyana.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling). If mutual agreement is to be reached on such matters, reliable people must be in post who have proper experience and knowledge to make judgments with some continuity and consistency. They must have a certain dependency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not part of my argument, to which the Financial Secretary will be eager to respond, to cast aspersions on the arrangements in Guyana. After all, the republic has other problems, including reaching a stage when it can hold a general election on the basis of a mutually agreed electoral register, let alone anything else. We can only begin to imagine its difficulties in putting people in place with the criteria, judgment and consistency to deal with individual cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Financial Secretary say who, where and in what post is the person in Guyana who has the necessary experience and professional judgment to reach the mutual agreement referred to in article 4(2)(d)? If all else fails, and the worst occurs when it is not possible through the terms of order to identify such a person, let alone equip that person with the necessary criteria with which to determine such matters, the terms of residence can be discarded. The definition of a place of effective management and where that might be situated, as described in article 4(3) would then come into play. A person wending his way through the different definitions—almost as though he was taking part in a obstacle course—of the rules for residence and different qualifications would reach the point of complete despair. Due to his inability to define properly the place of residence, he would fall back on a place of effective management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Financial Secretary offer his qualification of those terms in relation to residence and place of effective management, which is the term referred to in paragraph (3)? I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be able to do that because he has cosiderable knowledge of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
background of those matters. He was helpful to me during the proceedings on the Finance Bill earlier this year. None the less, it is incumbent on him to offer the Committee that guidance, because the matter rests on that definition. If it fails, the order will collapse. The matter is as crucial as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Milburn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Darlington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson) for covering points that I had intended to raise. Time is pressing and my hon. Friend has dealt lucidly and succintly with some of the issues that confront us in our detailed examination of the treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My remarks should not be interpreted as derogatory towards Guyana because I fully understand that its political and legal framework may not be as advanced as our own. I have read the treaty and the explanantory notes that were kindly provided by the Financial Secretary, in conjunction with background material provided by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East, and several issues require clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have dealt with some of the legal, political and institutional problems that arise from detailed reading of the treaty. I wish to comment on one or two of the economic and financial difficulties that I believe arise from the context in which the treaty takes effect. I seek assurances from the Financial Secretary that our country's business interests will not be prejudiced by the passing of the treaty and the difficult circumstances of the Guyanese economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to article 25, which deals with non-discrimination. It provides that neither country shall levy discriminatory taxes on the nationals or business enterprise of the other. Its thrust is contained in article 25(1), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected."</p></blockquote>
That is the essence of article 25, and it may seem reasonable and to accord with the philosophy of double taxation not only of this treaty but of the 100 or so other treaties that the United Kingdom has concluded with our international partners, until one reads about Guyana's economic background and some of the treaties that it is trying to conclude with its partners, not in Europe but in Latin America.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have grave doubts whether the United Kingdom and its business interests will receive non-discriminatory treatment as a result of some of the treaty provisions that Guyana is about to enter into. An example involves the plans of the Caribbean community Governments—the Caricom Governments—to impose new tariff restrictions as a result of the creation of a common market in that part of the world in approximately two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will know that a full debate is taking place in the Caribbean about the need for Governments in that part of the world to unite and work together, perhaps on the model of the European Community. According to an article in the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> of 30 April this year, Caricom has been arguing that the common external tariff is needed to protect its members' economies while it creates that common market which would give it the strength to compete in the global marketplace. Many of us will sympathise with the problems faced by developing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
economies such as Guyana's, and perhaps even with their need to engage in protectionist measures to ensure that they get a fair deal in the international marketplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a rub, however, and a problem in relation to the United Kingdom. The proposed common external tariff imposes low rates of duty on imports that do not compete with goods produced within the community, but sets high rates on imports that are likely to injure domestic industry. It is proposed that the rates to be charged will be as high as 45 per cent. Hon. Members will be extremely concerned about the potential implications of that level of tariff imposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a question for the Financial Secretary arising from that background. How does the Caricom proposal—as I understand it from press reports, which may be inaccurate—fit with the thrust of article 25, which gives a clear undertaking that there will be no discrimination against UK business interests? That is a matter of considerable concern. Other hon. Members have stressed that the Committee should not give a nod and a wink to a Government proposal to enter into a double taxation agreement simply because 100 other such agreeements exist. Specific circumstances in Guyana raise questions about whether the United Kingdom will get a fair deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cast no aspersions on the Guyanese economy, Government or business interests, or on those of the other Caricom member states. I fully understand why such tariff agreements are being considered in a part of the world that suffers greatly in the international marketplace, yet there are questions that the Financial Secretary must answer, but not just because I have raised them. I allude to another report in the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> of 10 December 1991. Hon. Members on both sides are worried not only about political stability and the problems faced by Guyana during the past 20 years or so, but also about the economic and financial instability that almost inevitably comes with developing—country status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No less an authority than the present Secretary of State for Social Security disclosed in a Commons written answer, when he was a Minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, that there were several high-risk markets. One of those was Guyana, the context being the sale of NCM Credit Insurance, the newly-privatised short-term credit insurance arm of the Export Credits-Guarantee Department. There was some concern about providing insurance cover in certain markets. Guyana was one of those markets. I hope that the Financial Secretary will have time to reply to our questions about instability and the lack of certainty about the Guyanese economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious that in the short time that we have to debate the order, many of our questions will not be answered. Would my hon. Friend comment on the fact that the state-owned bauxite company had debts of about $47 million, which it paid not in cash but in 12-year bonds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

another indication of instability in the Guyanese economy, through no fault of its own. Earlier this year, the state-owned bauxite company ran into considerable difficulties, owing about $47 million to suppliers and contractors, but rather than repay those debts in cash, it issued Government bonds. That is an extraordinary set of circumstances, giving rise to profound questions about the validity of nodding through this treaty without detailed scrutiny.

As a relatively new Member, I must say that I am astonished that we have been given only one and a half hours to explore in detail some of the issues that arise from the treaty. We need much more time to examine further some of the considerable difficulties. I am sure that the Financial Secretary would like to reply to the debate, so I shall cut my remarks short. I am sorry to disappoint my hon. Friends, but I should like the Financial Secretary to answer the specific points that I have raised about the financial and economic circumstances in which the treaty takes effect. I hope that he can give us guarantees that United Kingdom business interests will be properly safeguarded by the treaty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not detain the Committee for long. Article 4 has been extremely well covered by my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool, but perhaps we can ask the Financial Secretary for clarification. My hon. Friend was right to allude to the fact that there is a great deal of case law on the subject, but each treaty is subject to local variation and the Committee is entitled to further information on the matter.
