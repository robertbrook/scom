	<div class='legislation'>Draft Contracting Out (Functions of the Registrar General in relation to Authorising Re-Registration of Births) Order 1997</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Angela Knight)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Contracting Out (Functions of the Registrar General in relation to Authorising Re-Registration of Births) Order 1997.</p></blockquote>
The order concerns the re-registration of births, which may take place in two circumstances—first, where the parents of a child were not married to each other at the time of the birth and no one was entered in the register as the father, and secondly, where the parents of a child subsequently marry each other after the registration of the birth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, an application for re-registration has to be made either direct to the Registrar General or through a local registration officer, who forwards it to the Registrar General. If an application is successful, the Registrar General sends his authority for the re-registration of the birth to the registrar concerned, who then arranges for the parents to attend his or her office to complete the formalities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be aware of the significant increase in the number of children who are born outside marriage. They now account for about 34 per cent. of all births. There has also been an increase in the number of applications for re-registration made to the Registrar General—in the past 10 years, they have risen by more than a third, from 16,000 to 21,000. It is time that a
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
more effective way is found to deal with those applications, and the order is a suitable mechanism for achieving that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 69 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 enables a Minister to make an order contracting out the functions of an office holder—in this case, the Registrar General—subject to the assent of Parliament. That is the purpose of the order. It would enable the Registrar General to delegate to local registrars the responsibility for authorising the re-registration of some births. Clearly, some applications will involve complex correspondence, court orders, disputes about paternity and questions of foreign domicile. They will continue to be dealt with by the Registrar General. But if the order is approved, it is intended that local registrars will be able to process straightforward applications for re-registration without reference to the Registrar General. That will reduce public expenditure and be more convenient for those who need the service. Local registrars will be able to process most applications much more quickly and the public will thus benefit from a faster, more efficient service. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one brief question for the Minister. She said that both parents would see the registrar on application for re-registration. Would that happen in all cases, so that the parents would not be able to agree in writing but would both have to see the registrar in person?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Sir Robert.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>

	<i>Resolved,</i>
