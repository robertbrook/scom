	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Yet again, we find ourselves in this very unsatisfactory room, and now for the important Committee stage of this Bill. You may remember, Mr. Gourlay, that some of us constantly raised a point of order on the matter on the last Bill that we considered in this room. I ask you to look at this Back Bench, for instance. Last time, my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Cook) and I had to keep dragging a table in to give ourselves enough space.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very complicated Bill. The amount of paper work involved will increase throughout the proceedings. We shall find that on a Bench such as this there is not enough room for us to work satisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest also, Mr. Gourlay, that the amount of room for the public on a Bill of such importance is not satisfactory, either. Therefore, I would ask you whether it would be possible to get a larger room for our deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there is considerable difficulty regarding accommodation for Committees. Representations have already been made, before the Committee sat, and I understand that there is a possiblity that within 10 days we shall be moved into a larger room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland 
	<div class='member'>(Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill [
	<i>Lords</i>] the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote>
As the Committee will be aware, this is a sittings motion in the most straightforward and simple form. It may be of interest to the Committee to know that when the last Government, on the previous Bill, moved an identical sittings
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
motion it was approved without debate by the Committee, thereby showing the very constructive approach of the then Opposition, and, indeed, of all members of the Committee, to getting on with debate on the Criminal Justice Bill. I hope that that will be possible also this morning and that we can proceed immediately to discuss the important contents of clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. You will note that on the Notice Paper there is in my name and the names of certain of my hon. Friends a motion—or perhaps one may call it an amendment—on the sitings of the Committee. May we know whether you intend to call it, Mr. Gourlay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not selected for discussion I would point out to the Committee that what is contained therein can be discussed on the motion now before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's remarks in moving the sittings motion have provoked me into speaking on it although I had absolutely no intention of so doing. I hope that at this early stage the Minister will learn not to make provocative remarks such as he has just made and then expect Opposition Members not to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I well remember the sittings motion to which the Minister has referred, and I remember introducing it myself. Like the present Minister, I, too, had a fairly heavy work load in the Scottish Office, and I was very upset when no one from the Opposition, including the Minister, got up to suggest an alternative proposal for the Committee's sittings which would have helped me to discharge the responsibilities that I had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows, I am probably the most considerate and compassionate Member of the House of Commons, and it is really out of that consideration and compassion that I rise this morning to suggest to the Minister that his sittings motion is ill conceived. I have great concern for the Minister and the work load that he carries in the Scottish Office. Despite all the unkind and untrue things that he said about me at the weekend, I am nevertheless prepared to turn the other cheek, extend the hand of friendship, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
suggest to the Minister that his proposal is premature and that we should as a Committee reconsider the sittings motion that he has put before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw in evidence one or two points which are fairly obvious. For instance, this important Criminal Justice Bill is starting its progress this morning in the absence of the Solicitor-General. Plainly, therefore, it is not very convenient for the Solicitor-General to agree to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I do not know where the Solicitor-General is, but I have no doubt that he is carrying out some important duty somewhere. I shall not be as unkind as my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), who would suggest that he is still in his bed. He is obviously in some important place carrying out some important duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfair of the Scottish Office not to contact Fielden House, the Crown Office, to ask whether Tuesday and Thursday suits the Solicitor-General, since it is obvious that Tuesday does not suit him. I would not want to be responsible for imposing on the Solicitor-General the obligation to attend our Committee on a Tuesday morning if he does not want to appear. I have never been in favour of making anyone do something that he did not want to do. Therefore, we are due for an explanation as to whether Tuesday will suit the Solicitor-General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also interested in the make-up of the Committee, particularly on the Government side. As we count the number of advocates on the Government Benches, we see that there are five.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Six.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then someone is hiding somewhere—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That shows how easy it is to forget the Solicitor-General is here. I shall compromise and say five and half advocates. We all know how long it takes an advocate to answer a letter if a member of the public asks for an opinion. If he asks for it in July and receives it in December, his luck is really in. Advocates require longer to consider these matters
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
than do laymen such as myself. We are usually pretty speedy at dealing with these matters, but that is not the case with advocates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is most unkind of the Government to impose on their hon. and learned Friends the necessity to study documents on a Tuesday and to attend the Committee on a Thursday to give a decision on them. That is totally out of character with the advocate's training. Their training is one of leisure. We used to say that the first job of an advocate is to look for his next job, and that has not changed much. It is a leisurely approach, and it is unfair of the Government to impose this on their hon. and learned Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to single out the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay), but I am becoming rather worried about him. We all know that he has a past to live down, but that does not mean that he should volunteer to sit on every Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who said he volunteered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we to believe that the hon Member is the alternative to the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie)? Was that the choice that the Government had—the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East or the hon Member for Argyll, and they chose the hon Member for Argyll?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Education (No. 2) Bill, the hon Member for Argyll was there doing his stint for the Government. On the Tenants' Rights Bill, he was there doing his stint for the Government. Here, in the third piece of legislation in which the Scottish Office has been involved, the Criminal Justice Bill, the hon Member for Argyll is here doing his stint for the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to help in this catalogue, I think that I was also on the Bail Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way now to the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For some reason, the hon Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) has omitted the fact that I had been on the Civil Aviation Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should realise that I have not come to him yet. We had the hon. Member for Argyll on the Bail Bill, on the Education Bill, on the housing Bill—the Tenants' Rights Bill—and he is now on the Criminal Justice Bill. There is a great danger that in this Committee he will make a speech about school meals, milk or transport when we are in fact discussing judicial examination, or about the need to increase rents in his constituency when the accommodation that we are talking about is secure accommodation for youngsters under 21. It is unfair to confuse the hon. Member for Argyll in this way and not give him time to adjust his thinking between all these Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read with great interest of the talents that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) is developing. I understand that he is getting himself a reputation as a guitar player, and that during the Committee proceedings on the Tenants' Rights Bill he spent his time composing a song about hon. Members on this side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Be careful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He certainly has some good material to work on. It is for that reason that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South should be given much more time to consider his rhyming lines and the music to which he sets them before he goes to the next party that is thrown at the taxpayers' expense by the Secretary of State for Scotland and performs his song and dance act, for which he is becoming so well known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are one or two serious issues. These are all serious in themselves, but there are more serious issues which the Government ought to consider before we decide whether we should meet not on Tuesdays and Thursdays but on Tuesdays and Thursdays at this particular time. We are in favour of meeting on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but we do not think that Tuesdays and Thursdays for the next six months are the proper Tuesdays and Thursdays on which we should meet. If, at the end of this debate, we decide to vote against the Government's sittings motion, we shall do so on the basis not
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
that we are not in favour of meeting on Tuesdays and Thursdays but that we are meeting far too early in the year. We should give second thoughts to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the other issues which prompt me to suggest to the Government that they ought to think again. A number of bodies have made submissions—the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, the Faculty of Advocates, the lawyers' closed shop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Their trade union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That trade union has made a submission to us about the Bill. I do not know whether those hon. Members who are advocates had a say in that decision. I do not know whether they pressed for a compulsory ballot, using State funds. I notice that the decision was by a majority vote, and I do not know on which side of the majority or minority the advocates who are members of this Committee were in that debate. They need time to consider the position that has been put to us by the Faculty of Advocates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of my hon. Friends are anxious to take part in our debates. There is the important issue of the Royal Commission, which is sitting now, and whether we ought to consider this Bill in anticipation of that commission's report. It is fair to say that, while much of this Bill was contained in the Labour Government's Bill—I say again that I shall on this Bill stand by what I was responsible for in the last Bill—there have been some changes that clearly require more serious consideration before the Committee starts work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have noticed the confusion into which the Minister gets himself. Whenever a newspaper asks him to answer a question, we get some gems of answers. "When should detention start?" says 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> to the Minister. "I think", he says, "that detention should start from the minute that someone wants to go home."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Whips will be interested in that philosophy, I am sure. It is that kind of confusion into which the Minister gets himself that convinces me that the Committee ought to take some time off between now and, say, the date mentioned in my hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Friend's amendment, which you have unfortunately decided not to select, Mr. Gourlay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a reasonable proposition that the Government ought to take this sittings motion away, agreeing that we should sit on a Tuesday and Thursday, and that 17 June seems a very appropriate date for the Committee to start its work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of bodies which will want to make submissions to the Committee. We have all seen what has happened on Bills in the past when bodies have wanted to make submissions and those submissions have been overtaken by the speed at which the Committee was working. That is a danger in this case. The Committee will make such rapid progress that most of the bodies that want to make submissions to us could easily see their submissions overtaken by the speed at which the Committee works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Government will accept that it is not the Opposition's intention to filibuster the Bill or to try to frustrate the will of the Government. We want to examine the Bill, and we know also that hon. Members on the Government will not take the strictures of the Whip and remain silent. I hope that the Whip has not been twisting his hon. Friends' arms and making them remain silent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this important matter of criminal justice in Scotland there must be a very good reason for having six advocates on the Committee, and we can only assume that that reason is that they want to speak on the Bill. Obviously, one of the problems of Government Back Benchers is that they usually have to get briefs from the Department. I saw it yesterday on the Floor of the House when the junior Minister at the Department of Industry was giving out departmental briefs to get his Back-Bench colleagues to speak in a debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those briefs take time to prepare. With the Government paying off civil servants right, left and centre, it is unkind to expect the staff remaining in the Scottish Office to prepare such briefs in order to allow the Government Back Benchers to take part in the debate. Therefore, the staff at
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the Scottish Office need considerable time. I have the greatest respect, the highest regard and the greatest sympathy for them in the present difficulties under which they are working, and I certainly do not want to see some of our young and attractive civil servants placed under great strain during the progress of the Committee. I hope that time will be given to those young civil servants to prepare the briefs necessary to allow Government Back Benchers to take part in debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may well make some comment about an apparent change of mind on the part of various Members. I know that he will have to take some time to persuade his hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) to hold on to the change of mind that he has had, because changes of mind operate across the political barriers and they often affect politicians of all parties. I am anxiously looking forward to hearing in October or November this year why the hon. Member for South Angus changed his mind from his Scottish Council for Civil Liberties days to his present view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we can wait until October or November for that confession. We are not anxious to humiliate the hon. Gentleman in the months of May, June or July. That would allow him to have his holidays in peace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go back to where I began and place on record that the Committee has started this morning in the absence of the Law Officer. The junior Minister has the ability but the senior Minister has the authority, as is often the case, may I say. The Committee is starting in the absence of the senior Minister, who has the authority to railroad the bill through. He is not even here this morning. It is a grave imposition on the Solicitor-General to suggest that the Committee should meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays when it is perfectly obvious that Tuesday certainly does not suit him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have shown great consideration to hon. Members on the Government Benches, much greater consideration than was shown to me when I had responsibility for the Labour Government's Bill. There was no attempt on the part of hon. Gentlemen then to protect me from all the tasks that I had to perform. No consideration was given to me. When I moved the sittings motion that we meet on Tuesdays and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Thursdays, not one hon. Gentleman had the decency to get up and say that the Minister was working far too hard and that we ought not to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but here am I, at my first opportunity, trying to protect the Minister from his own colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one final point about the Minister's other responsibilities. We find this morning that the Solicitor-General cannot be present, and I believe that in the not too distant future the Minister will have responsibility on the Floor of the House for taking through its Report stage the Tenants' Rights, etc. (Scotland) Bill, which is a very complex piece of legislation. I understand that two or three days will be given to Report. The Minister will need time to study all the briefs concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had a look at the 
	<i>Official Report</i> of the Committee stage of the Tenants' Rights, Bill and I am very impressed by the number of concessions made by the Minister. I hope that it is a precedent for this Committee. I was impressed by the number of times that the Minister said he would look at a certain matter and would inform the House on Report or would write to an hon. Member about points which had been raised. I can imagine hundreds of letters coming out of the Scottish Office to meet the commitments given by the Minister. He needs time to put all those letters together, to sign the letters and to study the briefs on the Tenants' Rights Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His hon. Friends should have some consideration for the Minister, and they ought not to accept the sittings motion. Out of sheer consideration and compassion for the Minister, we ought to say that we shall not meet on Tuesday and Thursday at this time, and if the Minister wants to get the Tenants' Rights Bill behind him we can certainly give further consideration to when the Committee should meet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, I have not finally made up my mind on how I should advise my hon. Friends to vote on the sittings motion. We shall wait to hear how the debate develops. At present I am minded to advise them to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call any other hon. Members, I should say that I have been a little lax in interpreting and applying our Standing Orders to the speech of the hon.

The rule of the House is such that in debating the motion to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays it is not competent to suggest the postponement of a Standing Committee where that does not fall within the rule. Therefore, while there is a right for an hon. Member to make some reference to when the Committee might start, perhaps at some time in the future, we cannot have a protracted debate on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I presume that the same applies as the reason for not selecting our motion to adjourn for two months.

Is that not in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to try not to raise the wrath of the Chair. I certainly want to try to keep within order, but some important matters arise in this little argument and they deserve an airing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little alarmed at what seems to me the almost indecent haste with which we are asked to move to a heavy sittings motion. It is unseemly and, more importantly, it is unnecessary. This is not in accord with Conservative virtues. I think that the Conservative Party has always believed in being seemly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has not always succeeded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has not always succeeded, as my hon. Friend reminds me, but it has always tried. I am sorry that no pretence has been maintained to put a veneer of respectability on the naked power of the Patronage Secretary on this occasion.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
I stress the word "unnecessary". We have taken the Bill, not in any fundamental sense but in terms of common custom, in reverse order. It has been through the House of Lords, and therefore Ministers who, quite understandably, are anxious to get their progeny safely born, do not have to worry about a protracted Lords stage at the end of the Commons proceedings, we have only to get it through this place and through Report. I should have thought, taking the Government's point of view—it is not mine, of course—there was clearly sufficient time to do that on the normal basis of meeting on Tuesday and Thursday mornings only.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member may not have heard the sittings motion, but that is exactly what it proposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that. There is no need to go on at great length about this. On the basis of Tuesday and Thursday mornings, on my calculations we have, until the likely date of the Summer Recess, 14 weeks to go. Fourteen weeks on this basis is a very long time. On the Committee stage of the last Bill, we had only 12 sittings. So on that precedent, assuming that the Committee stage would be roughly the same length, we could have one sitting a week rather than two and still have weeks to spare. For reasons which I shall advance, it seems to me that that would be a particularly useful change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will agree that we can usually look at the precedent of the last Bill. I hastily concede that we have what might be described as a Dunpark section and a McElhone section inserted which might take a little longer, but, on the other hand, we have already disposed—with the Opposition's co-operation—of the Bail Bill, which has removed a fairly fundamental section from the previous Criminal Justice Bill. So there is every reason to believe, if there is no filibustering—and why should there be if there is good will on the Government side—that on the basis of one sitting per week we could comfortably conclude this Bill long before the end of July or the likely date of the Summer Recess. Of course, the Minister will no doubt have a follow-up period when we return in the autumn, when further debates could take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
The Minister has one great advantage over his predecessor on the previous Criminal Justice Bill. I hope that my hon. Friend will forgive me if I mention that there is unlikely to be the kind of anxiety there was on that occasion. The Minister will remember that there was quite a number of amendments and a fair number of speeches by Members on the Labour side. I hope that I am wrong, but I do not think that we are likely this time to see quite that level of activity from the present Government Benches. It is true that we have a great plethora of members of the Faculty of Advocates, but they may well wish to be back home trying to convince their colleagues in the Faculty that there is some merit in the Bill, since they are showing a great deal of scepticism. I suspect that we shall not have very many speeches from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), who has already deserted the Committee, has just been appointed a kind of Butlin's cheer-leader for the Conservative Party in Scotland. This is an onerous responsibility, because cheering up the Conservative Party in Scotland must be a full-time job. That will leave the hon. Gentleman very little time to prepare the kind of speeches that he might otherwise have felt moved to prepare in line with the policy of the Faculty of Advocates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been reference to the fact that the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Mackay) has a Liberal past to live down. I use the word "Liberal" with a capital letter, and I hasten to assure him that I would not accuse him of any other sort of liberalism. The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) also has a liberal past—with a small "I"—but he has probably already recanted in private, and I fear, although I may be wrong, that we shall not have a very lengthy recantation in public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unlikely that the Committee will be held up by undue or uncharacteristic activity on the Conservative Back Benches. I had some hopes for the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) because a plethora of amendments appeared on the Notice Paper in his name, and I was particularly interested to see a new clause which advocated the reintroduction of birching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
I thought that that might be an example of rebellion on the Conservative side of the Committee. Then, of course, I remembered that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), the Minister, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) and the absent Solicitor-General all enthusiastically voted for the reintroduction of birching on the last occasion. [Hon. Members: "Voted for it?"]. I fear that it is true. Therefore, they have presumably inspired the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire's amendment, and I have no doubt they will support it enthusiastically when the time comes. So that should be, from their point of view, quite a short debate. However, I must warn the hon. Gentleman—I hope that he will not be upset—that we shall probably insist on a fairly full debate on that new clause, because some of us have some doubts about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a good reason for thinking that there will be measured and proper examination of the Bill on this side of the Committee; we can promise that. There will be no filibustering. Also, there will be calm, peace and quiet, no doubt, behind the Minister. In these circumstances, given that an exhaustive Committee stage in the last Parliament took only 12 sittings, it seems to me that we could with great advantage ask the Minister to look again at the sittings motion and take it back to one sitting a week so that we should not meet both on Tuesdays and Thursdays as presently proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's proposal is not only unnecessary but it is undesirable in terms of the progress of the Bill. This is important. My hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) mentioned the problems of consultation, and this is something that we ought to consider. We have never made any secret that somewhere in here there is a good Bill struggling to get out. There are 80 clauses, and if the Minister would allow us to cut out 10 and make a few amendments here and there, we should probably be prepared to give him the other 70, and I should be prepared to throw in the eight schedules for good measure. So we are really not facing an enormous task here in the time that has been allotted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
But it is important, in the limited areas of controversy, that we should not attempt to gallop through the matter but we should should allow proper time for consultation with the myriad organisations and the large section of public opinion engaged in the argument on these clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will be the first to accept that it is more than just a case of anxiety, and it is not just, in the Solicitor-General's immortal new collective noun yesterday in the House, a spectrum of Left-wing opinion. It is not even—to use a more abusive term in his vocabulary—a matter of merely Left-wing intellectuals who are attacking this measure. I notice that the Minister in another place referred to the opposition to it as the misguided assertions of various vociferous groups. He may be right, but I do not need to remind the Committee that the vociferous groups include large sections of the Law Society, including its criminal procedure committee, and I do not think that that is a dangerous nest of Left-wing disaffection, although I am always prepared to listen to argument on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not know how many of the advocates here turned up to vote, but in any event they will be aware that on two of the three main areas of controversy the Faculty of Advocates has important representations to make and is extremely unhappy about the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the so-called Left-wing disaffection—which was, if I may say so, fearlessly denounced and exposed by the Solicitor-General in the very temple of disaffection, Milnathort, the day before yesterday—can hardly be taken to cover the areas of advice which I have outlined. Indeed, only the other day, taking it from the top of the legal scale to the bottom on the judicial side, I noticed that the Glasgow Association of Justices of the Peace had some very critical things to say from their point of view about the impact of some of these provisions on their work on a day-to-day basis in the district courts. On top of that, there is all the academic opinion that has been ranged against
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
proposals in the Bill. There should be adequate time for consultation, and the proposed timetable does not give it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not gone on at length, and I have not yet mentioned the valid point about the work load on members of the Committee. May I say in passing—I hope that no one will accuse me of taking too narrow an interest—that I am a member of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, as are, I think, four or five hon. Members if we include both sides. We were in Inverness all day yesterday, and we shall meet on Wednesday. Next Monday we shall be all day in Edinburgh. To add to that two meetings a week of this Committee, and the additional burden which is a particular problem for the Government side of having only a smallish group of Back Benchers, is a real consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also have some fears for the Minister. He is looking distinctly peaky and peely-wharly these days. I recognise that he went through a considerable trauma on the Tenants' Rights Bill. We now have the Criminal Justice Bill. I do not suggest that his appearance in any way fits him for the job of gravedigging, but at some point he will presumably disinter and revivify the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, which had its Second Reading many months ago and has now gone into a state of suspended animation or limbo.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of that burden, there is a case for saying that the Minister is perhaps too keen in pursuing the interests of his Administration and that he should consider whether once a week on the Criminal Justice Bill, with time to think, prepare and consult, would be an investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should try to limit ourselves to 10 minutes, Mr. Gourlay, and I think that I am just about on that. To sum up, there is no pressing need for two sittings a week in terms of the precedents, measuring the likely work load and the fact that there are about 14 weeks before we have to consider the looming summer break. If we fall behind, we shall be perfectly prepared to consider, assuming that there is a good response on important amendments from the Government side, speeding up progress by meeting more often, if necessary. But on any reasonable argument it is unlikely to become necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know the Minister and I appreciate that he would like co-operation. It would
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
be no bad thing for him to listen to the genuine pleas from the Opposition. If he forces through an unacceptable sittings motion, it may be counter-productive in terms of co-operation between the two sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a tyro at these things. I have never been a Whip and I have never been a Minister. Like most of us, I do not really understand the usual channels. But I understand that they talk to each other and at some point the Minister may—I do not know—look for an agreement about a final date or on the timetable. I have no idea whether there will be a response, but I put it to him that if it starts the Committee off on a note of controversy and a basis of non-agreement about the sittings motion, I suspect that those conversations and contacts—it will have nothing to do with me, because I shall not be involved—may be a bit more difficult, and that would be sad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just because he wants to push on in this fashion, pushing his luck against the views of the Opposition, the Minister may find himself doing something thoroughly counter-productive and making the progress of the Bill—perhaps a slightly different Bill: we should like an amended Bill—that much more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I hope that the Minister will consult his hon. Friends and take a more reasonable view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was thunderstruck when I heard the sittings motion. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that we should be forced into a two-sittings week at this stage of the Session. There were reasons for thinking that quite apart from the admittedly rare precedent. I had heard rumours that there might be a severe and tyrannical sittings motion, involving us in two days a week, but I did not believe that it would happen for the simple reason that the amended motion tabled by my hon. Friends and myself, which you, Mr. Gourlay, have said cannot properly be put, outlines a view held not only by my three hon. Friends and myself but by a large number of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill was brought in in a hasty fashion. It was shown in the first week of discussion to have been done in a hasty fashion and to be inadequate. It was brought in in the House of Lords. The curious thing about the discussions in the House
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
of Lords was not so much that their Lordships succeeded in bringing about some improvement—we expect them to be able to improve most Conservative Bills—but the speed with which the changes were accepted by the Government spokesman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, one would have thought that a Bill brought before their Lordships would have had at least a background of considerable thought and argument to let it stand up, but in fact there was capitulation on point after point. As soon as criticisms were made on different points in the Bill, the truth rushed through like a shining light in the mind of the Minister of State and he accepted it on the spot, because truth cannot always be prevailed against. If this be true over small sections of a Bill put under scrutiny, it must manifestly be true of a Bill of 81 clauses and 8 schedules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that were not sufficient evidence for suggesting that we are right in saying that the Bill should be postponed, there is the evidence which has been brought to bear by innumerable bodies of experts throughout Scotland. The Faculty of Advocates has been referred to, and the Law Society, the Bar Association and the various groupings of academic lawyers in departments of criminal law and criminology throughout the universities in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a Bill that has no friends. It is a pity that it has no friends because, struggling to get out of the Bill, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said, are a number of very useful propositions which we should have liked to be able to discuss at leisure, to clarify and to improve. That has been prevented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of what happened in the Lords and what has happened over the past few weeks and months, with the strong protests expressed, it is manifest that a Bill of this kind, that should secure the backing of the people of Scotland and of the practitioners of the law of Scotland, should now be subject to a proper process of consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to take it away, wait till 17 June and go through the process of consultation, we could come back with a Bill which would have a rapid passage through the House. Certainly, that would entail dropping certain clauses, but it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
this which has given rise to much of the discussion and analysis by the various bodies in Scotland. There is no doubt that if the Minister said he would withdraw even the first part of the Bill, the rest of the Bill could make reasonably rapid progress with, say, one sitting a week from then on; it would go through in harmony and with agreement, and the Minister would go down on record as a Daniel come to judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Talking of judgment, one remembers—as we all do now; it is our daily conversation—the famous judgment of Lord Cooper in 1954 in the case of Chalmers v. Lord Advocate. This had slipped my memory over the past few months, but I was reminded of it by the letter in 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> yesterday. This is important to the point I am making about postponing the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Cooper was talking about the question of taking suspects to police stations; not merely detention, not merely the whole question of search, but the precise point of taking suspects to police stations to interview. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However convenient the modern practice may be it must normally create a siuation very unfavourable to the suspect."</p></blockquote>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there is often a kind of shorthand way of thinking on the Government Benches and when hon. Gentlemen see the word "suspect" they equate it with "guilty". They must not do that. We must not always call a suspect "the accused". There is a tendency in some of the arguments on the Bill to make that kind of assumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Cooper said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the eyes of every ordinary citizen the venue is a sinister one. When he stands alone in such a place confronted by several police officers, usually some of high rank, the dice are loaded against him, especially as he knows there is no one to corroborate him as to exactly what occurred during the interrogation, how it was conducted and how long it lasted."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must point out that we cannot deal with the substance of the Bill while discussing the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Mr. Gourlay. I merely wanted to underline the argument that there should either be an easy tranquil one-day sitting on the Bill each
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
week or else a postponement so that such points may be properly investigated. I accept what you say. I do not think that I even said that Lord Cooper was right in his judgment. I merely said that he had made it, and that we daily recall it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the first point, that there is need for delay while discussion takes place. This morning, three other things have happened which prompt us to say that there are even stronger arguments than I had suspected when we first put down our amended motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the absence of the Solicitor-General. This is serious. It means that, if the Minister had his way, we would now be discussing the first amendments without the presence of the Law Officer—indeed, the only Law Officer for Scotland in the House of Commons, because the other one is in another place. It would be quite intolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are doing the Committee and Parliament a service in demanding that we continue the discussion on this motion until such time as the Solicitor-General arrives. Many other Committees of which he was not even a member have been held up while the Solicitor-General has been sent for. I hope that we take the decision today to send for him in the remaining time, because he should be here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious matter. We shall be discussing a Bill dealing with the criminal law of Scotland in the absence of the senior Law Officer in the House of Commons. He should be sent for. He should be here. If he is in his bed, he should be dragged out of it. He cannot be taking a case because he must have known that we had this Bill today. He was quite abusive to me in the House last week, so he knows that we have this legislation today. He should be here. He should be here for legal reasons, and he should be here for linguistic reasons, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden about the speech made, as he said, in that hotbed of dissidence, Milnathort, by the Solicitor-General at the weekend. He used phrases about
	<br><blockquote><p>"the orchestrated assault on their integrity"</p></blockquote>
—that is, the integrity of the police—
	<br><blockquote><p>"by a spectrum of Left-wing groups".</p></blockquote>
He must clarify his language. It is a public statement made by the senior Law Officer.
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
What does he mean? In my simplicity, I thought that a spectrum was a variety of colours, presumably, in this case, on the political front from red to indigo blue. But now "spectrum" is apparently a grouping of colours. It is now used as a collective noun. That assault upon our language should be defended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A collective noun is always useful. I have been trying to think of a collective noun for the six advocates opposite. It is difficult. A collective noun for them would have been a "faculty", but the Faculty of Advocates disagrees with them, so they cannot be called a faculty of advocates. We could call them a "pride" of advocates but that has already been preempted. A "bail" of advocates, perhaps or a "diet" of advocates—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A bar-room of advocates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I would not go that far. We might call them a brief of advocates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hog</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: An avalanche.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I prefer a brief of advocates, to an avalanche of advocates. But we remember the hon. Member for Angus, South (Mr. Fraser), who is now having to switch views. Perhaps we should call them a confession of advocates, or, if he is forgiven for his views, an absolution of advocates. There is a problem here, and it has relevance to the debate. The obvious nouns are a "fee" of advocates or even a "purse" of advocates. They have other work to do. They have to earn their corn, and it is imposing a great deal on the six practising advocates on the Government side that they should not be away to do what they see as their lawful business by being absent on, let us say, Thursday each week to earn an honest buck for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the second interesting thing—the presence of the six advocates on the Committee. I was astonished to discover how many there were. One is absent, the most senior of them all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third curious thing is the lack of support by the entire Government side, with the exception of the Minister. The Minister produces his sittings motion. He speaks to it in a perfunctory way for two minutes, insults my hon. Friend in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
process by his reference to past example, and sits down. When a Minister makes a two-minute speech, he does so because he is confident of the full backing of be Benches behind him and if necessary, of the Pavlovian reaction of the advocates—the "Pavlovia" of advocates—but not one has stood up to defend or advance the proposition. Clearly, they are aggrieved, and they have a problem. The problem is that they have an interest. They know that if they were to say the obvious thing—that the Minister is wrong and that we should meet once a week—they might be accused by ill-minded people of being thought to want the day off so that they can go to earn an honest buck up at Parliament House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: An honest buck?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, lawful. "Honest" is perhaps a value judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there are the reasons—the lack of support of hon. Members on the Government Benches, who are clearly on our side, the absence of the Solicitor-General, and, above all, the strong argument that there must be time to consult on the crucial questions in the Bill so that we many then proceed on the even tenor of our way once that process has taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it does not stop there. We were confronted at 11 o'clock last night with the missing aspect of the Bill—the money resolution. We did not get any last night, but we must have some answers this morning before we proceed, and the Government may wish to withdraw that money resolution and come up with another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The money resolution refers to a cost of £650,000. Some of us do not believe that to be possible if the Bill is implemented in its present form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may briefly comment on one or two parts of the Bill, without discussing the merits, there is, first, the question of detention or search. All of us know that either it is intended to carry it out—there is no sense in withdrawing it at the moment—or it is not. If this is carried out, and if the views of most of the people of Scotland who have considered the Bill are right—that there will have to be a big increase in police activity as a result—and if it is believed that this is an easy way
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
of finding people who are transgressing the 1953 Act and carrying offensive weapons, charges must follow. They say that there will be a big number—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. While the debate has a fairly wide scope, it does not allow one to discuss the financial resolution which was approved by the House last night; nor can we discuss the terms of the Bill itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly not discuss the financial resolution in detail—my only comment about it was that it is for £650,000—but I hope that it is in order to say that we have to consider the implications for the community in Scotland, one of them being the cost. It is as important for a man to know that he is hit in his pocket as that he is to be arrested or detained or searched without—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is a matter for later debate at an appropriate stage in the Bill, not on the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Gourlay, but it shows why it is necessary for us to have time to consider these questions, because the Government may wish to reconsider that aspect of it. It is in defence of the need for time that I am arguing this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to detain the Committee, because it is important that we get on, but there are other points to be made. A heavy work load always faces Scottish Members of Parliament. Despite what is said by the 
	<i>Daily Mail</i> and other newspapers, we are a fairly busy group of people, and within the busy group of Members of Parliament generally Scottish Members are particularly busy. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) sits down night after night to see how he can improve the law of Scotland—coming up with the answer, obvious to him, of birching. It takes a lot thought and burning of the midnight oil to come up with such recommendations as "Bring back the birch".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are others. I have already referred to lawyers. But the truth is that the Scottish Member of Parliament carries a double burden. He has to be involved with every aspect of United Kingdom legislation, busy in the House, busy in Committees, and, above all, busy in Select Committees. In addition to that is the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
burden imposed on Scottish Members by the fact that we have our own separate legislation, as we have our own separate Select Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a triple burden for Tory Scottish Members, because there are not very many of them. They were rejected, by and large, by the people of Scotland—I make no debating point about that—and there are not many of them here to bear the enormous burden of doing probably more daily work than any other Members and having to man Committees. I was astonished and I felt sorry for hon. Members opposite when I heard the roll call read by my hon. Friend on the Front Bench, the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth, showing the number of Committees on which they have had to sit. One Committee per Session of that length is enough for any man, let alone a Scottish Tory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everything points to a deferment of the discussion of this Bill. I am sorry that our amended motion was not in order and that the Minister himself did not solve the problem. I suggest a decent and honourable compromise, which I think would have the backing of the practising advocates behind the Minister. It clearly has the backing of the Solicitor-General or he would have been here to defend his colleague on the Front Bench. It reminds one of the Sherlock Holmes story of the curious incident of the dog that did not bark in the night. The Solicitor-General has not even been here to bark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, it has that backing and the compromise is obvious. Let us deal with the initial clauses of the Bill in a leisurely way to allow consultation and, we hope, compromise to take place in the Committee. Let us decide to meet once a week. If the Minister comes forward with the obvious compromise of postponing the Bill for, say, a month—which would be in order, coming from him—we shall accept that. We are straightforward people here. We want to make progress. We want to discuss the Bill properly, and we want its provisions to be understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should compromise on that if the Minister suggested a month's postponement. But if he feels that he cannot do that because he has not yet spoken to the Solicitor-General—I understand his problem, because the Solicitor-General is not here to speak to—surely he can change
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
his motion to provide for meeting, say, on Tuesdays. We should then be able to discuss the Bill at some leisure and, when we had passed some of the more controversial matters, we could move to calmer waters. But if he takes his present troglodyte and intransigent attitude it will make things difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden, I know nothing of the ways of the usual channels. I have never been a Whip. I shall make a confession. I have never even been a Teller in the House. So I know little of the manoeuvres that go on. I am an honest, straightforward Back-Bench Member who sees things publicly as they are and as I understand them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I am pretty sure that the usual channels could discuss well and that the Committee could discuss well, and those advocates who have to earn their honest penny in Edinburgh would come down, not in a sense of aggrievement, as they must have at present, but with a sense of co-operation, eager to add their wisdom, knowledge and understanding to our debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end on this note because I want to make this neither an auld nor a lang syne. My hon. Friend referred to the proclivities of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) and to the fact that he spent some time writing songs. Would I had so honest a trade. It would be an honourable role for any man or any advocate. I feel a little aggrieved that he has not sent me copies. Any man who writes a song in Scotland should send me a copy, and it would go into the voluminous file that I shall produce once I retire. If we ever get to the end of the Criminal Justice Bill so that I can retire, I hope that he will send me a copy of what he produces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But let us sing together on this. Let us compromise. Let us go forward in the solid way that the people of Scotland, expect, allowing consultation and discussion, and let us come up with a Bill which will do credit not only to its advocates opposite but to the good sense of the Committee as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason why I have risen to speak this morning is my concern that the Government appear to be rushing the Bill. There has not been a proper explanation of its multitudinous
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
clauses and there has not been a proper public debate about all that is involved. That is not merely my observation; it is the observation of learned societies within our legal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a letter that I received the other day from the Glasgow Bar Association the observation was made that Members of Parliament should press the Government to issue a Green Paper on the proposals contained in the Bill. There is apparently no proposal to issue a Green Paper. That concerns me, because the Government have not really obtained the views of the people and have not been able to get across in Scotland all that they intend to do. I believe that it is important that there should be such a debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society of Scotland, in a lengthy memorandum which it has provided us with—indeed, it is a very helpful memorandum on the Bill—makes the observation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While acknowledging that the earlier Bill and all these Reports of Departmental Committees were already available"—</p></blockquote>
that was a reference to what had gone before in this matter—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and that many of them had already been studied and reported on by the Council"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the Council of the Law Society of Scotland—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Council has had difficulty in commenting, within a short space of time, on such a lengthy, varied and complicated Bill, drawn from a variety of sources and containing also new material which has not been the subject of previous consultation."</p></blockquote>
If it were merely I who was saying that, hon. Gentlemen could object, but the Law Society of Scotland is an extremely well respected institution. When it makes such on observation, we have some responsibility to take careful account of what the Law Society of Scotland says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill [
	<i>Lords</i>] raises fundamental issues about how we conduct our affairs. There is no doubt about that, because the institutions that have written to us so far, with the exception of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, are societies and associations that have in their ranks practising lawyers. The SCCL has that as well, of course, but these are learned societies. I think that is how they describe themselves, but, being a humble trade union man, I have never understood how the legal profession is organised. However, I
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
am quite sure that, as we make our way through the Committee over the next few months—if that is when we are to meet—I shall learn a great deal about the legal profession and how it is organised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Addressing myself to the question—because you have drawn our attention, Mr. Gourlay, to the need to stay with the question—it is: why have it? There is not a satisfactory answer to that. The Minister made the mistake of not making a case for his proposal for the sittings motion. I should have thought that a lawyer of his talent would undoubtedly have felt that he should make a case for his proposition. The Committee is the poorer for not having heard such a case. It is unfortunate that we have heard no substantial argument why we should meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Why, in the absence of substantial argument, should we be persuaded to do anything? The whole point of having a Committee is surely to go in depth into each and every provision, and some of us will do it line by line. I should have thought that the Minister would have opened the proceedings this morning by making a substantial case which we would then have had the responsibility of answering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not persuaded that there is any argument for proceeding in a hurry. After all, these proposals have a profound impact on the police. Therefore, I want to consider them carefully and I want to hear from the police. I have received no papers from the police force, nor from the chief constables in Scotland. I have received no papers from the Police Federation. Since the Bill makes so many provisions with regard to the police, I shall want to ask them to get in touch with us so that we may know their views. Clearly, that will take time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That argument applies with equal force to the courts. In view of the serious provisions regarding court procedure, I wish to consult those of my colleagues who are practising lawyers and to learn from them how they view the Bill. That will also take time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, I shall want to hear from people in society. I want time to reread the multitude of letters which have appeared in the newspapers and the letters which we are now beginning to receive. I want carefully to consider what people are saying before I start making decisions in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
The legion of advocates on the Government Benches will no doubt correct me if I am wrong, but I understood that the law of this country had been developed over centuries. Now we appear to be in a fearful hurry to get it all tidied up on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I know that the Minister and his colleagues have tidy minds, but to railroad us in this way is far from satisfactory. We are being asked to consent to major changes—changes which have not been explained or fully debated in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have plenty of time to consider the Bill. Indeed, there is a time for everything under the sun. I think that my case is supported by the Scriptures. I could argue that there is a time for doing everything. It is Proverbs, if you care to look it up some time, Mr. Gourlay, and I shall be glad to discuss it with you. There is a time for everything, and a season for doing things. I think that is how it is put. This is not the season for pursuing this measure, because the preliminary work, which is so necessary in these things, has not been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) spoke about consultation. I heartily agree with everything that he had to say in that respect. Consultation is the prerequisite of conciliation. As my hon. Friend said, there cannot be conciliation between divided parties unless there is consultation.

I am talking not only about institutional consultation. That will certainly be possible, and the institutions with responsibilities in our legal system will seek to consult us. We must have wider consultation on a Bill which will have such an impact on society. Therefore, I shall want to consult many groups of people who would not hitherto have considered that they had a particular view on the legal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need time to consult the education authorities, because some of us believe that this Bill contains clauses which will be used in a way not in the interests of young people. I shall not discuss the particular clauses to which I refer, because, as I understand your earlier ruling, Mr. Gourlay, members should direct their attention strictly to the motion before us.
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
I am trying to say that we need time to consult youth leaders, and people who have an interest in the well-being of young people to see whether they believe, as we do, that certain clauses will direct unfortunate attention towards young people. We shall want to examine and discuss that matter with that kind of community group. I hope that the legal people have that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Undoubtedly consultation will require the Government to withdraw some of the more contentious clauses. One cannot consult people and then say "We are going ahead anyway". That is the mistake that we sometimes see in industry. Consultation requires a certain responsibility on the part of those who are taking the initiative to give way to the expression of opinion when that opinion is well supported by fact and argument. Therefore, I believe that consultation would have to be meaningful. It would take time, and time is what I am trying to discuss.

We have the provisions that are proposed to be added to the Bill by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker). His new clause 1 would reintroduce birching into this country. If we require birching to be reintroduced, as suggested by the hon. Gentleman the abiding impression with which I am left is that Blairgowrie must be one hell of a place. I am sure that there are not hordes rampaging through Rosemount every Saturday night. The hon. Gentleman is not here to tell us whether they are not. He has not risen to his feet this morning, despite the fact that he clearly has a deep and all-consuming interest in this matter and is most anxious to reintroduce fifteenth century morality into practice of criminal justice in Scotland. I shall want time to consider that proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, it would not only be in Scotland. The hon. Gentleman's view was that these powers would be needed not in Rosemount, but in the Wellmeadow section of Blairgowrie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that was his view. I am not sure where that was reported, but, from conversations reported to me, that was the view of the hon. Members for Perth and East Perthshire.

I understand that birching is popular at the moment in certain regimes in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
world. I shall not mention them, because I do not want to offend those regimes. There are wider interests, and others in the House have responsibility for the conduct of matters relating to those Governments. But it would seem that they have found a convert in the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire. If they have converted him, I should wish to listen most carefully to all that he has to say in future about the Bill. I should also want to consider the clauses that he seeks to amend and new clause 1 which he seeks to introduce. But we shall hear all about that by and by.

May I comment now on the absence of the Solicitor-General. I find it extraordinary that the Solicitor-General can travel to Milnathort in the far reaches of the realm, make a speech about the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill and comment on members of the Opposition such as myself but not face me and my colleagues in Committee at its very first sitting. After making a widely reported speech at the weekend, he fails to appear here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that part of the process of democracy was the accountability of those who have responsibility and who take themselves about the country making wild, extravagant speeches attacking hon. Members. The best thing that they can do is to come and say these things before you, Mr. Gourlay, and give us the opportunity to reply and to defend ourselves against that kind of attack. The Solicitor-General's prestige is a little dented this morning as a consequence of his absence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to be brief. I have a reputation for brevity. The 
	<i>Sunday Post</i> once said that I was man of few words. The 
	<i>Sunday Post</i> is a reputable paper and I should like to maintain that image. Therefore, I shall not proceed for much longer. I know that one of my hon. Friends is anxious to speak. But I am not satisfied that we have had a proper explanation of the Bill. I am not satisfied that we have had a proper public debate. I am not satisfied that there has been proper consultation, and I am not satisfied that a case has been made by the Minister for meeting on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Until I am satisfied on those points, I cannot accept the motion before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel a certain sense of 
	<i>déjà vu</i> at being back in this room discussing yet another Bill. What delights me is that I am the only person on this side who was not on the last Committee. I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) that hon. Members of the Government Benches must be feeling rather overworked. I find, like by hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), that one major Committee a year is quite enough, and I am sure that by the end of June or July I shall be agreeing with him even more wholeheartedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found my hon. Friend's regard for the Minister's health very touching. I do not wish ill to any person, but it is a little hypocritical to say that we are concerned that the Minister should be kept in good health in order that he may continue to introduce legislation of this nature. I certainly do not want that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gather from my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg), who has already cited the 
	<i>Sunday Post,</i> a paper for which I do not have the highest regard, that it suggested—I think last month—that the Minister was due for promotion once he had managed to steer this Bill through Committee. Perhaps that is why he is pressing so hard to get the Bill through as quickly as possible. The more quickly he can get the Bill through the House and out of the way, the sooner he will take a step up the ladder, which may take him away from the Scottish Office altogether. Most of us on this side of the Committee would take that quite well, if that be the reason why he is pushing so hard for this measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have commented on the fact that the Solicitor-General, the only Law Officer in the House of Commons, and the important Minister on this Bill—I say that with no disrespect to the Under-Secretary of State, who is present—is not here for the very first sitting of the Committee. I am now the fifth Member to raise this matter, and on no occasion has the Minister who is present taken the opportunity to explain what important business the Solicitor-General is engaged in—so important that he cannot be present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With all due respect, I think that that means that the Solicitor-General is not on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
important business, that there is some quite unnecessary reason why he is not present, and it is sheer disrespect to the Committee that he has not managed to get here this morning to take part in our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that were not the case, I am sure that the Minister would have been quick to his feet to intervene in the very first speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemeouth to explain where he was and why he could not be present. Even now, I am giving the Minister every opportunity, by perhaps over-labouring this point, to get to his feet to explain where the hon. and learned Gentleman is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. That is exactly the point I was about to make.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made some important points on the sittings motion showing why we should sit only one day a week. Our basic case is that there has not been a proper consultation procedure. This is the second Scottish Bill on which the Secretary of State for Scotland has not deigned to serve on a vital Committee. Despite two very important pieces of Scottish legislation, he has not himself managed to get on to the Government Benches to take the Bills through the Committee, though he is quite happy to introduce Bills on Second Reading. On Second Reading he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill proposes wide-ranging and fundamental reforms of the Scottish criminal justice system. Its 81 clauses and eight schedules represent the most substantial reform of Scottish criminal procedure, evidence and treatment of offenders since 1963."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 14 April 1980; Vol. 982, c. 811.]</p></blockquote>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State at the Scottish Office, the Earl of Mansfield, when he introduced the same Bill in another place, went even further than the Secretary of State. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…the present Bill bids fair to be the most important Scottish measure ever passed on the subject."—[
	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 15 January 1980; c.13.]</p></blockquote>
Those are important statements by Ministers, and although we may disagree with what is actually in the Bill nobody on the Opposition side would disagree with the point made by the Secretary of State. We may have some reservations about what was said by the Minister of State in another place, but we, too, would agree that this is an important measure. Therefore, it should have had the fullest possible consultation with all interested parties before it ever came to the House. Even now, at least if we only sat on Tuesday morning and not on Thursday as well, that would give people who are gravely concerned about it time to come to us and give their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no great experience, having entered the House only last May, but I believe that this has been one of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
busiest Sessions in terms of legislation that any Parliament has every seen—and that from a Government who promised us less legislation, not more. Here we have a Bill which they say is gravely important. But we are not facing some enormous crisis of crime in Scotland. There is no sudden upsurge of crime in Scotland. There is no great pressing necessity to introduce this legislation now to solve an immediate problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crime figures in Scotland for last year actually dropped, very much as a result of the good work of my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth, when he was Under-Secretary of State at the Scottish Office. The police numbers have gone up. So what is the pressing need at this time to introduce a piece of legislation which is said to be so important by the Secretary of State and the Minister of State? Why push it in at the tail end of a Session in order to rush it through? Why did the Government not leave this until later in their spell in office?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately—it is a great misfortune—the Government will, I think, be defeated in the next couple of years within these walls and thus be forced into a general election, unless at long last we really get a revolt by Conservative Members. Therefore, they have time to consider, to think and to give due consideration to the views of other people outside this place so that they may bring forward a Bill which truly represents the wishes and needs of the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that there has not been consultation, and if we met only one day a week at least organisations such as the Law Society would be in a position to present their views to the Minister and to other members of the Committee so that we could deal with such matters in detail. My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West has already said that the pressures on Scottish Members are enormous, for the reasons he gave. If we meet two days a week, our ability to meet and consult with these organisations is lessened considerably, and we shall find it very difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us have a look at some of the organisations. My hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East has already referred to the Law Society. Con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
servative Members are quick to say that the Law Society supports the Bill, but the Law Society says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Having regard to the complexity and importance of this Bill, the Council also regrets the failure of the Government to issue a Green Paper on its proposals which would have allowed fuller discussion of the many fundamental issues involved. It is an additional matter for regret that although the Bill was published on 19 December 1979, supplies were not available in Scotland in any quantity until 28 December 1979. This did not assist the Council's task, particularly in view of the very tight time-schedule for observations."</p></blockquote>
Again, we see that the Law Society, which, I am sure, the Government will in later debates call in aid in support of their views, agrees with what we are saying in terms of the timetable—that there has not been proper consultation. My point is that if we were to meet only one day a week, that would really be insufficient and we should put consideration of the Bill off for a short period. The motion I put down with my hon. Friends proposes that we should do precisely that, to allow proper time for consultation and consideration. But even if we meet only one morning a week, at least we should have time for greater consultation with bodies such as the Law Society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Faculty of Advocates takes the same view. The document which I received over the weekend says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The majority of the Faculty recommends that a provision for detention should certainly not be implemented until proper consultation with all interested bodies has taken place."</p></blockquote>
As we have already heard, six out of nine hon. Members opposite are advocates. It is perhaps a lesson, particularly in the week in which the STUC is meeting, to see such loyalty, brotherhood and unity among the trade union movement of members opposite. Six of them are members of the Faculty of Advocates, and I assume that that is their trade union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And a closed shop at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And a closed shop at that. We on this side believe in trade union solidarity, in sticking together and following, not blindly of course, but trying to work with our trade union and certainly always consulting with our trade union so that we have the fullest view of what our trade union is saying. Not so hon. Members opposite, who have a total disregard for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0088">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
what their trade union is saying though I accept that members of the Faculty of Advocates may consider my description of them as a trade union slightly suspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East also raised the question of the Glasgow Bar Association which also has raised the important question of lack of consultation. My hon. Friend mentioned some important points that the Glasgow Bar Association has raised, and I quote one such point now:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While the Government would be prepared to consider further discussion on the Blenner Hassett proposals relating to the law—as it now stands—affecting drinking and driving, and has issued a consultative document thereupon, it has not to date issued any similar document in respect of the matters contained within the current Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill"—</p></blockquote>
a much more important measure than the laws affecting drinking and driving, however important they may be. Yet here we have the Glasgow Bar Association saying that there ought to be consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Council for Civil Liberties has said the same:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government appears determined to push through changes in the law which have not been properly explained, publicly debated or thought out. This leaflet highlights the worst provisions of a badly drafted and ill considered piece of legislation."</p></blockquote>
That is an important point. We shall waste a lot of our time sitting on Thursdays not just discussing the important principles contained in the Bill but actually trying to change the very bad drafting because the Bill was pushed through in a great hurry in order to get it on to the statute book. We shall have to waste our time on Thursday morning, after spending Tuesday discussing the principles, in getting the drafting right. That should not be necessary. We should be here to discuss the principles. The drafting should be done properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The principle of the Bill has already been discussed and approved by the House. We are to discuss the principle of the clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>. I am sorry. I meant discussing the principle of each individual clause, which we shall be entitled to do I hope, on many of the clauses when we come to the clause stand part debate. But we shall also have to consider the bad drafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
I accept that hon. Members opposite may not necessarily have a high regard for the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties. Perhaps they consider it as part of the inner spectrum of the Left wing. I know that the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) does not feel that way, because he helped to present the evidence of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties to the Thomson committee when it was discussing the exact proposals now in the Bill, when he made very different points from those which I assume he will be making in our debates during the next few weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Derek Ogg, who is a Conservative solicitor, has mentioned the lack of consultation. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do not believe this to be the case. We believe that there has to be informed reasonable discussion of this matter."</p></blockquote>
I accept that hon. Members opposite may not have high regard for Mr. Ogg as a Conservative, but he is the chairman—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reaction opposite is highly reprehensible. It is not only because he is a fellow Conservative. They are sneering at him because he is only a solicitor and not an advocate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I often find it difficult when I am speaking to hear the remarks of hon. Members opposite, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for explaining them to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that learned and other important bodies—I know that hon. Members opposite may not agree on their importance—the STUC, the Scottish Liberal Party, the Scottish National Party, the Labour Party, and the many learned bodies, the Faculty of Advocates, the Law Society, the Glasgow Bar Association, the criminology department and the law department of Edinburgh university and the law department of Glasgow university—have all said, even if they do not condemn the measure, that there has not been sufficient consultation. And even now the Government are treating the members of this Committee with total disrespect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a highly complex Bill. I accept that there are hon. Members opposite who are qualified and trained lawyers. My
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0089">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden is a qualified and trained lawyer, and a very good one, too. [An hon. Member: "A distinguished one"] Yes, a distinguished one. But there are seven of us on this side and three on the other—I might even include yourself, Mr. Gourlay—who are not members of the legal profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that it was the custom to have notes from the Government. During the proceedings on the last Bill on which I was a member of the Committee, and certainly in the more complex stages, we had notes on clauses. There are no notes yet from the Government for this Bill. Yet, if the Minister had had his way, we should now have been debating clause 1 and the amendments to it without any notes of explanation as to why it was necessary and what evidence there was from outside bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<i>The Spectator</i> made a good point in an article, that co-operation between police—if I may just give a small example—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is going very wide of the motion before the Committee. Whether we require notice or explanations of clauses is not, in my opinion, a matter that arises on this motion. I may remind the hon. Gentleman also that the rule about tedious repetition does not necessarily apply to his speech, but it becomes tedious repetition when he produces arguments that have already been repeated several times in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept your ruling, Mr. Gourlay, and I hope that I have not been tediously repetitious. I accept that there has been some repetition, but I hope that it has not been tedious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I was trying to make on the notes on clauses—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the absence of the Solicitor-General is due to the fact that he is away preparing the notes that are wanted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may be right. I am sure that the Minister will tell us whether that is the case. My point about notes on clauses is this. Without them, we find it difficult to carry on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
work of the Committee. That is why the sittings motion is so important. If we had the notes, we might be able to move more expeditiously through the Committee stage, even, possibly, meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays. But, without the notes, we have to go through, as members of the Committee, particularly the non-lawyers, a lot of detailed work that has been done, through all the reports, through the debates in the other place, through the evidence given by other bodies, in order to adduce the arguments we wish to make on the various clauses. If we had the notes from the Governments explaining their reason—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already drawn the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that I do not regard his arguments as being within the rules of order regarding this motion. I hope that he will come to a conclusion on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Gourlay. I have finished the point I was making on the notes, and I have really finished the bulk of what I intended to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I wish to emphasise again is that there has not been proper consultation on the Bill. There is a need for the Committee to meet only, at the most, once a week so that members of the Committee can have proper time to consider the Bill carefully, clause by clause, and as my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden said, it should not take a long time. The first part of the Bill is contentious, but we can get through that reasonably expeditiously if the Government are prepared to work with the Opposition on it. But by pushing through this sort of timetable motion, we shall be in considerable difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Honourable Gentlemen have expressed some curiosity about the absence of my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General from this the first sitting of the Committee. I am able to inform the Committee that the reason why my hon. and learned Friend is not able to be with the Committee this morning is that he is undertaking a long-standing engagement to address a session of the Sheriffs Association in Scotland. I am sure the Committee will agree that it is important that that engagement be kept. I suspect, indeed, in some respects my hon. and learned Friend was perhaps
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
more realistic than I was about the likely business that would be conducted this morning on the merits of the Bill. He may indeed have felt that it was safe to leave to my humble hands the handling of the sittings motion, realising that there would be relatively modest opportunity to consider the merits of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Is the Minister telling us that the Government chose this date and this sitting in the conscious knowledge that the Solicitor-General would not be present? Is this not an insult to the Committee, if, indeed, not out of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And it is also incorrect, if that would assist the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point that was raised by hon. Gentlemen was to pay some attention to the fact that I am assisted on the Committee not only by three lay members of the Committee but by five of my hon. Friends who are members of the Faculty of Advocates, and, indeed, we have the distinguished presence of the hon. Member for Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). The Committee will be able to be assured, as will the people of Scotland, that in consideration of the Bill there is no question of the matter being rushed through without the presence and advice of those who are knowledgeable on the details of the criminal law in particular, and that clearly is an asset and one which the Committee as a whole will welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden of the remarks that have been made this morning has been to suggest that the Committee should either be delayed or there should be only a small number of sittings of the Committee in order that there should be further discussion, particularly on the contentious parts of the Bill. It has been suggested that there has been inadequate discussion; that there should be a Green Paper, White Papers and various other papers published and that discussions should take place before the Committee comes to consider these proposals. I was surprised that there was no reference to the fact that the vast majority of the contentious proposals were first published many years ago. We have the three very voluminous reports of the Thomson committee, including the
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
second report which was published as far back as 1975. I have given therefore, at the very least, five years of discussion to all those bodies and groups that wish to make their views known on the matters concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to that, we have had the advantage of the previous Government's own Bill which completed its whole Committee stage before a general election intervened, and I do not remember the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) or any of his hon. Friends suggesting at that time that there should have been a Green Paper or a White Paper or any other form of paper published in advance of Parliament's discussions of that Bill. It is curious to understand how, if a Green Paper or discussions were unnecessary at that stage, they should be more necessary now, 12 months later, after a full parliamentary discussion of the previous Bill and after a further year of considering the merits or otherwise of the Government's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept two things: first of all, that what he has said in the present Bill is different from what the Thomson committee said in a very important respect; and, secondly, that this Bill is different from the Bill introduced by my right hon. Friends in the previous Government? That is the reason why we wish to have a Green Paper on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To the extent that this Bill may be different from the Thomson committee's recommendations, it is certainly no more different than the previous Government's Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>rose</i>—</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way to the hon. Gentleman. I am answering his hon. Friend at the moment. He should at least let me answer that point before he seeks to intervene with a further one. The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth will be aware also that the basic principle of detention, which is a controversial matter, was in his own Government's Bill. There was no Green Paper; there was no White Paper. The previous Government quite rightly pointed out that there had been five years
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
of opportunity for discussion since the Thomson committee produced its recommendations, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, who was the Minister in charge of that Bill, will be the first to admit and to emphasise that he and his right hon. Friend saw no need for such a discussion document. If, therefore, we had reached a stage where the debate in Parliament could begin a year ago, it is stretching credibility to suggest that we have not reached that stage today. I think that the Opposition know that perfectly well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden pointed out quite correctly that the previous Committee stage took 12 sittings to complete its business. That started on the basis of a sittings motion identical to the present one which went through on the nod. The then Opposition took the view that it was more sensible to use the time available to discuss the merits of the Bill rather than to waste a whole morning without any opportunity to consider that matter. I pay tribute to the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Donald Stewart), who is clearly anxious to start the real deliberations on the Bill as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by making reference to a remark of the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg). He quoted from the scriptures in his support. He pointed out that there was a season for every purpose and suggested that that justified delay. He will remember that that particular extract from the scriptures goes on to say that there is a time to work and a time to weep. We shall have plenty of opportunities for both, and on that basis I commend to the Committee the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Gourlay, you will remember that at the beginning of the debate I said that I had not decided how I should advise my hon. Friends to act on the sittings motion. I am bound to say that the statement made by the Under-Secretary in relation to the whereabouts of the Solicitor-General is very disturbing indeed. If, as I suspect, the Solicitor-General is speaking this morning to the sheriffs, attacking those who have some doubts about the validity of this piece of legislation, I say to the Government that that would be the final insult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'> Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General is addressing a training session of sheriffs on sentencing policy. He is not making a public speech on any other matter of the kind to which the hon. Gentleman refers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall wait with keen anticipation to see whether there are any press reports about comments made by the Solicitor-General, whether it is a training session about sentencing policy or not. I warn the Government that if the Solicitor-General has absented himself from the Committee today in order to speak to a training session of sheriffs or any other body and has taken the liberty or displayed the impertinence of staying absent from the Committee and attacking those who have reservations about the Bill outside the Committee, that will be the wrong foot on which to start the Committee stage of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is one thing to go to speak to the sheep in Milnathort on a Saturday or Sunday when the Committee is not sitting, It is a totally different thing when the Committee begins its work for the Solicitor-General to display such impertinence. I am not all that sure of the Solicitor-General's expert knowledge of sentencing policy. I always thought that his role in law until he became the Solicitor-General was to stop people being sentenced. There is a whole host of people who go round Scotland boasting that the Solicitor-General is the very advocate who helped them to avoid fairly long sentences, and no doubt we shall come to that at a later stage of the Bill. But I want to put on record the fact that we in the Opposition are deeply disturbed that the Solicitor-General considers that a training session of sheriffs is more important than the first sitting of the Committee stage of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend care to comment on the fact that the Government chose this day to start the Committee in the knowledge that the Solicitor-General would not be present? In addition to what the hon. and learned Gentleman says today, that of itself was an insult to the whole operation of the House of Commons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that point. As my hon. Friend said, that is a very important point. When the Bill was first discussed, it was understood on all sides of the House that the Bill would begin its Committee stage not on Tuesday 22 but on Tuesday 29 April. I assume that it was against that background that the Solicitor-General undertook what he considered a very important engagement in the knowledge that the Committee would not be sitting today. Then, lo and behold, the Whips exercised their persuasive powers, charms and influences as they are wont to do from time to time and we find ourselves in Committee on a morning when the Solicitor-General is speaking to a training session of sheriffs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My only other point about the absence of the Solicitor-General is that I am delighted that the Under-Secretary has at least cleared up a nasty rumour that was going round the House. Before I came here this morning, I heard it whispered in the Tea Room and in all corners of the House that the Solicitor-General was in Streatham. I do not know why the Solicitor-General should be in Streatham, but I understood that, for some unknown reason, he was in Streatham. I am delighted that we have cleared up this nasty rumour that the Solicitor-General was not in Scotland but was in Streatham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his very brief reply to the detailed debate, the Under-Secretary mentioned that he was delighted that he had on his side of the Committee six advocates—five Back Bench advocates and the Solicitor-General making up six. No doubt we shall have a visit from the Solicitor-General now and again. The hon. Gentleman made the rather astonishing comment that the people of Scotland could sleep peacefully in the knowledge that the law would be made by five advocates. I should have thought that that was a reason for nightmares. I should not have thought that that was a good reason for anyone to sleep peacefully in his bed. Possibly that is one of the best reasons why this Committee stage of the Bill should last much longer than any other Committee stage, because the law is not made for lawyers nor should it be made by lawyers. It is made for the people. It has not been my experience that people rest easily or content in the knowledge that advocates are dealing with the problems that will affect their everyday lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
So I must say to the Minister that the fact that the Government have decided to load this Committee with so many of his learned friends has also given us cause for concern and has made us determined to examine the points that they put with particular interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I say that we have a natural suspicion or apprehension, I am sure that that will not be misunderstood but will be taken in the spirit in which it is said, that people have some concern when so many advocates are involved in the making of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point that the Under-Secretary made in relation to the length of time that most of this material has been published is not relevant to the debate that we have had today, nor is it relevant to the request that we have made for time to be given for further consultations. What the Minister says is beyond dispute. Most of the material has been published. This is the first time it has appeared in legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the second time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not the second time. The stop and search powers did not appear in the previous Government's Bill. They were inserted in the previous Government's Bill by the casting vote of the Chairman of the Committee at that time. The judicial examination provisions did not appear in the last Government's Bill. The decision to reduce the number of peremptory challenges did not appear in the last Government's Bill. The decision to create a specific crime of vandalism did not appear in the last Government's Bill. I could go through a host of provisions in this Bill that did not appear in the last Government's Bill—all very important issues. The difference between the position then and now—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been a change of Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been a change of Government, and that gives us cause for concern as well. I agree with the Minister on that. But the difference between the position then and the position now is that, as we have said time and time again on this side of the Committee and on the Floor of the House, there are large parts of the Bill which will be agreed. There are many good things in the Bill. That is why I have never taken the view
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
that we should throw the baby out with the bath water and reject the whole Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am strongly in favour of the Government's proposals in relation to the treatment of drunken offenders and many other aspects of the Bill. I shall support that. But that does not mean to say that the other important and vital issues introduced into this new Bill ought not to be the subject of further discussion both inside and outside the House. It is simply not good enough for the Minister to come to a Committee and say that most of these proposals were published in 1975. The football crowd behaviour material was published only in 1979. There are one or two other things that were published rather late. Indeed, the retrial and identification procedures were all published much later than 1975 and they appear in proposed legislation for the first time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows perfectly well, without my having to tell him, that if a Committee makes some kind of suggestion and people get the impression that there is no possibility of that proposal appearing in legislation, the desire to discuss it and to give an opinion on it is rather less than if that proposal is seen as forming part of prospective legislation. So it is not a very good argument for the Minister to say that most of this was published in 1975. In the first place, it is not accurate and, in the second place, it is not a soundly based argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the possibility voiced by some of my hon. Friends of the publication of a Green Paper. On some of these subjects—I do not say the whole Bill: as I have said, there are aspects of the Bill with which I agree—further discussion is required. Whether that discussion would be facilitated by the publication of a Green Paper, I do not know. My experience of Green Papers is that there is usually a small, interested group which discusses the content of a Green Paper, and the vast majority of the public who are interested in these matters either cannot get the Green Paper, do not know how to go about getting the Green Paper, or encounter all sorts of difficulties when it comes to discussing such publications. So I am not not thurled to the idea of publishing Green Papers on this or any other aspect of policy. I sometimes think that they are used for purposes that are not desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
Having listened to the Minister's reply, I come to the recommendation that I make to my hon. Friends. I wish that I could have said to my hon. Friends that we should accept the Government's timetable motion. But I must say to the Minister that I cannot now say to my hon. Friends that we should accept the proposition before the Committee. One of the main reasons why I recommend my hon. Friends and the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart)—if he feels inclined to join us—to vote against the Government's sittings motion is that in many ways this is the only vehicle available to us to indicate our anger about the absence of the Solicitor-General and his view that addressing a training session of sheriffs in Scotland is much more important that his appearance at the first sitting of the Committee considering the Criminal Justice Bill. If the Law Officers relegate the Bill to a position of importance less than a meeting with sheriffs on sentencing policy, clearly it does not have a very high priority in the Law Officers' thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that logic is correct—and I do not see how the Minister can disprove it—and the Bill does not occupy a high degree of priority in the Law Officers' thinking, there is no earthly reason why his hon. Friends who are burdened with all these other tasks and duties should be locked here in the Committee room Tuesday and Thursday for week after week, when we on the Opposition side are seeking with might and main to try to save them from themselves. If I advise my hon Friends to vote against the motion, it is on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is one which the Minister failed to address himself to when replying to the debate. Running through the speeches made by my hon. Friends was the thread of concern that we have all displayed for Government Back Benchers, members of the Government and particularly for the Minister. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) put it rather aptly when he said the Minister was looking rather poorly these days and that we were anxious for the Minister's health. Here we are trying in our usual compassionate way to show some concern and some consideration for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
the Minister, and he does not even get up to thank us. He disregards it altogether, as if we had never mentioned it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we come to discuss the various aspects and clauses of the Bill, I hope that the Minister will not then get up and accuse us of being unkind, inconsiderate and all the rest of it in relation to the problems that he, as a Government Minister, has, when in actual fact on the first sitting of the Committee we held out the hand of friendship only to have it smacked fairly firmly by the Minister and rejected completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to write into the record of the debate that we have had today the fact that here we on the Opposition Benches this morning were offering such helpful gestures as not meeting Tuesday and Thursday, giving the Minister every consideration, giving him time to prepare for the Report stage of the Tenants' Rights, etc. (Scotland) Bill, even removing the embarrassment of the Solicitor-General not being able to attend from time to time, giving the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) time to acclimatise from the Education Bill to the Tenants' Rights Bill and to the Criminal Justice Bill, and giving the advocates all the time that they always need to read briefs—that is history in relation to the legal profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have offered all these facilities to hon. Members. We are also very concerned that the Minister, his hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General and the Government Whip will need time to reconsider their position in relation to the new clause that has been tabled by their hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker), because, having voted for birching on the previous Criminal Justice Bill, they will come to the Committee and try to persuade the Committee why birching should not be reintroduced. I honestly believe that we have done the Minister a service this morning in trying to create a few weeks' time in which they can take their misguided hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire aside and give him—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A birching.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says "a birching". I was about to say "a lecture"
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
and explain to him the embarrassing position that he will place his hon. and learned Friend and his hon. Friend the Minister in when moving that new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time that we were offering to the Minister and to the Committee could have been well spent and could have removed this extreme embarrassment that Government Ministers will feel when it comes to the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire moving the new clause to facilitate birching in Wellmeadow at Blairgowrie. I take it that it is part of the hon. Member's proposal that there will be public birching in Wellmeadow, though not in Rosemount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman did not hear the programme properly. I said regarding detention, referring to the radio programme in which I took part, that I expected that there would be very few individuals taken for detention from Rosemount but that I should not be at all surprised if a number were taken from Wellmeadow. It was not a matter of discussing birching.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member will not pursue this point much further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. Gourlay, that we should not pursue much further the point that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire makes, that he does not expect that many people from Rosemount will be taken for detention but that he does expect that in another part of his own constituency, the Wellmeadow at Blairgowrie, a whole host of people will be taken for detention. If I were to pursue that point, which I shall not, I would say that the people in Wellmeadow at Blairgowrie must be very disturbed at the way in which their own Member of Parliament seeks to cast such serious aspersions on the character of those people who frequent the Wellmeadow, which is a favourite spot for my wife and my family on a Sunday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without pursuing the point further, the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire has just put off four tourists that normally come to the Wellmeadow at Blairgowrie. I park my car behind the gas tanks there, probably the finest tourist attraction in Blairgowrie, and we usually have a nice walk round the shops, a cup
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
of tea or meal in a café, and we meet a great many people. But, without pursuing the point further, if the hon. Member is to threaten me with being stopped, searched and detained in the Wellmeadow at Blairgowrie, I can tell him that I will take my wife and family elsewhere into respectable constituencies such as Castlemilk and Drumchapel. If I can rouse the right hon. Member for the Western Isles, I might even some Sunday bring them to Stornoway if the right hon. Member promises me a drink when we get there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I have said sufficient to convince my hon. Friends that we ought not to accept the Government motion. If hon. Members on the Government Back Benches would care to join us in the vote, they would endear themselves to their right hon. Friend the Prime Minister because we should be doing the Government a favour. I am very interested by the way in which the Prime Minister has sought to consult various Scottish Back Benchers on how they think that the policies in Scotland are working. She chooses wisely and well. I cannot think of anyone more suited than the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire to stand in the queue in the Members' Cafeteria when a voice says, "Hello, Bill."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order, I must confess that it is all very interesting about the dreams of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire and perhaps also the Prime Minister. But I should like to deal with the matter before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, Mr. Gourlay. I am anxious for the Committee to proceed and again I will accept your ruling and will not pursue the point of "Hello, Bill. Would you care to get off your chest your feelings about what is happening in Scotland?" Of course Bill explains to the Prime Minister that this Criminal Justice Bill—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman and the Committee will obey the ruling of the Chair. I have already ruled that it is not relevant to discuss that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wished to point out that the Prime Minister was getting the best advice possible from Tory Back Benchers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Prime Minister is not a member of this Committee. I have already ruled that it is not relevant to discuss that matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:—about the need to have this Criminal Justice Bill and the Committee meeting on Tuesdays and Thursdays. That is one of the matters that my hon. Friends and I have been arguing against this morning. We think that the Government are ill advised to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays. For that reason, we think that the Prime Minister might have chosen her source of advice much more wisely. She could easily have turned to the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie), who would have kept her right on all these matters and would have advised her that he was not in favour of the Committee meeting on Tuesdays and Thursdays. He spoke on Second Reading, but, lo and behold, he is not even on the Committee. A number of hon. Members who did not speak are on the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Again, I must call the hon. Gentleman to order. We are not discussing the membership of the Committee, which has been decided by the Committee of Selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the decision of the Committee of Selection. As you know, Mr. Gourlay, I have never questioned the authority of the Chair, the Committee of Selection or any other person who has authority in the House. I am the first to accept the rulings on the selection, but I thought that these comments would be interesting from the point of view of hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have held out the hand of help and friendship and have had our knuckles firmly rapped. I suspect that we shall be defeated and birched in the vote. Nevertheless, we are establishing the position on the first day's sitting of the Committee that the Opposition were helpful, kind and considerate in the consideration of the Bill. Therefore in debates which have yet to take place, I hope that the Minister and the Solicitor-General—I know that he will read this debate—will not accuse the Opposition of frustrating the progress of the Bill or doing anything that could remotely be described as unkind, when we have been pillars of virtue this morning, as we always are.

	<i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill [
	<i>Lords</i>] the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order, Clauses 1 to 12, Schedule 4, Clauses 13 to 26, Schedule 1, Clauses 27 to 32, Schedule 2, Clause 33, Schedule 3, Clauses 34 to 44, Schedule 5, Clauses 45 to 80, Schedule 6, 7 and 8, Clause 81; New Clauses; New Schedules.</p></blockquote>
It will assist the Committee if the schedules are considered with the clauses to which they relate, otherwise the Committee will be required to come to a decision on the clauses without having had the opportunity to debate the schedules which give much of the substance of the matter to which the individual clauses relate. That is in accordance with previous practice, and I accordingly commend this motion to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great interest to the Minister's description and defence of the motion. He has not made clear why we should take these provisions in this particular order or why we should relate certain schedules to particular groups of clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a crucial matter, and it is relevant on this occasion, Mr. Gourlay, especially in the absence of notes on clauses. One of the reasons why we</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put:</i>—</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 7.</p>

	<p>debated the sittings motion is that there are complex matters in the Bill which need understanding as well as consultation. One of the reasons for suggesting a single day was that it would give us time, in the absence of notes, to be able to formulate amendments or to understand, in particular, some of the complex schedules.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>

	<p>I do not think that we can pass this motion in the absence of an assurance that we shall be given notes on the clauses. I find some of the schedules extremely complex. Unlike the Government side, we are not backed up by half a dozen advocates. We have had a tyrannical sittings motion thrust upon us. We have been given one day between sittings in which we are expected to deal with analysing, understanding and, if necessary, amending clauses of the Bill, and this is made worse now the schedules have been brought into line with particular clauses being discussed and put through at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>

	<p>As my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) will know, this can be a complex matter for the Minister, let alone Back Benchers, but at least a Minister has the benefit occasionally of the advice of the Solicitor-General, and he has the advice of a battery of staff. For that reason, we have argued the case, and continue to argue the case, that we want notes on the clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>

	<p>On a lot of the Bill a common attitude can be adopted. When that common attitude is adopted, the notes on the clauses

can assist us in making sure that we get the right clarification, the right wording, the right drafting. It is therefore, in order to co-operate with the Government that I hope we shall not proceed immediately without further explanation of the reason for each of these schedules being attached to these clauses before we accept the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>

	<p>All this underlines again the absence of the senior Law Officer who could be guiding us here. We could put these questions directly to him, schedule by schedule, clause by clause. Indeed, I may do so to the Minister, but I want to make progress. In the first schedule that is mentioned, schedule 4, the Minister will see some of the complexity with which we have to deal.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>

	<p>For example, there is the relationship to the 1975 Act:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In section 68(3) (notice of previous convictions)—

	<ol>

	<li>the words 'where the accused pleads not guilty at the first diet' shall cease to have effect;</li>

	<li>for the words 'second diet' in each of the three places where they occur, there shall be substituted the word 'trial diet'."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
These are complex matters for laymen such as myself. Even the nomenclature we use can be of extreme complexity to some of us who are innocent in these affairs. Yet I am asked to take this and debate this along with clauses 1 to 12, which contain some of the parts of the Bill which have led to most controversy. I do not go into the merits at this time, but it will be accepted that they are the parts of the Bill which have led to most controversy—the very matters in Scotland on which people have been arguing the need for a Green Paper for consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>

	<p>Everything here underlines the Tightness of our case earlier this morning, and more importantly, underlines the importance of looking at the order of consideration. Clauses 1 to 12 and schedule 4 should not be taken first. They are precisely the provisions on which people in Scotland have been asking, one, for a Green Paper, two, for consultation, and three, that we should have notes on the clauses. So, whatever else happens, we should not proceed this morning, especially in the absence of the Solicitor-General, with clauses 1 to 12.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>

	<p>The first part of this group of clauses deals with the whole question of police powers, with the question of detention,
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
and with the question of search. The number of amendments tabled, particularly, by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), shows the anxiety and doubt that there is about even apparently innocent provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>

	<p>In the first amendment, on which I cannot comment now, I notice what appears to be a mistake on the Amendment Paper. Perhaps I may be guided on this, but the first amendment seems to contain an error which has been perpetuated from issue to issue of the Amendment Paper and which should be clarified. I should have thought that some attention might have been given to that. We are asked to proceed even this morning to discussion in the absence of such clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>

	<p>I hope that the Minister will change his mind on the proposed order of associating schedules with clauses throughout, and above all, I urge that clauses 1 to 12 should not be taken first. It is no defence to say that the proposed new power is imitative or partly based upon a Bill introduced by the previous Administration. It is a completely new clause in relation to powers of search. It is new, and it is on this that controversy has taken place. So we cannot take lightly the apparent formality of this motion that the Bill be considered in the order proposed.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a motion dealing with the order of consideration, but if the hon. Gentleman wishes me to deal with the notes on clauses this is a separate issue which does not arise from the motion. The practice we are pursuing is that adopted by the hon. Gentleman himself on his own Bill, where it was not considered appropriate to make notes on clauses available. Of course, if any of the Committee wishes assistance as to the meaning or significance of any particular clause or part of the Bill, I shall be happy to provide it. This is in total accordance with the views of the hon. Gentleman when he was the Minister in charge of the previous Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot remember any request being made for notes on clauses from the Opposition, because I suspect that, being lawyers and advocates, they think that they know it all. They did not ask for notes on clauses when our Bill was going through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a substantial difference between this Bill and the previous Labour Government's Bill inasmuch as that Bill went through its Committee stage and we had a major debate which was recorded in the proceedings of the House. So we have on record a great many aspects of the debate which took place during the period of the last Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) is always right to press, and I join him in pressing for notes on clauses, particularly on the first part of the Bill, clauses 1 to 12. This is the most important part of the Bill, without doubt. It is the part of the Bill that includes the stop and search powers. It is the part that includes in clause 6 judicial examination. This is the part of the Bill that includes the provision for interviews by the police to be recorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the Minister to say that he does not consider it important to give the Committee notes on clauses of such vital importance to the liberties of the people of Scotland is outrageous. It is not acceptable to the Committee to be treated in such a cavalier manner. The Minister would facilitate the work of the Committee if only he would agree to make the notes on these clauses available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understood that this Government, of all Governments, were supposed to be in favour of more open government. Apparently, in the case of judicial examination, identification parades, the tape recording of evidence and all these other new aspects of the Bill contained in clauses 1 to 12, the Government intend to keep to themselves the information—and the notes which they have prepared—which led them to put this matter into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister does not want to help the Opposition, I can understand that. I do not object to that, if that is the attitude that he wishes to take. I have no objection to that small-minded approach. It does not worry me in the least. But, surely, to give the general public in Scotland the reassurance that the Bill had been debated against the background of the knowledge which the Government had in their possession before they drafted the Bill, that would have been one good reason, if not the best reason, for the notes on clauses being made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a possibility, of course, that there are no notes on clauses and that, because of the cuts in the Civil Service in the Scottish Office, there has not been time to type them. That is not the responsibility of the people in Scotland. They voted against that kind of policy at the last election. So they really ought not to be made to suffer because the Government have decided to do away with 1,400

	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
jobs in the Scottish Office and the Committee is therefore to be deprived of the notes on clauses in what is probably the most important piece of legislation that Scotland has seen since the turn of the century. This is a vital Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that he will keep to himself the background information that the Government have when it comes to considering why they put this matter into legislation at all. We have never been given any reason by the Minister why he is withholding from the Committee the notes on clauses. He says that he is following the practice adopted by the last Government. As I said earlier, there was not request at all for notes on clauses when the last Bill was going through, and I suspect that I got the reasons for that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On identification parades, the judicial examination and the stop and search powers, we have the reports of the various committees which recommended these proposals. But they are not sufficient for the Committee to do its work. We must have the thinking of the Government themselves why these proposals have found their way into legislation. It may well be that the notes on clauses whould be more helpful in persuading us to accept
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
some of these more unpalatable things than the Solicitor-General or the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I register my protest at the cavalier attitude whith which the Minister has treated us this morning. Unless he comes up with notes on clauses on Thursday, he must expect the Committee stage to take considerably longer than it otherwise would.
