	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>COAL INDUSTRY (BORROWING POWERS) ORDER 1974</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I appeal to hon. Members not to be inspired by the performance of the hon. Member for Essex, South-East (Sir B. Braine) in the House last night to keep their comments within reasonable limits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sir Myer, my hon. Friend the Member for Essex, South-East (Sir B. Braine) was acting nobly on behalf of his constituents who felt strongly about the matter under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a point of order, Sir Myer. I fear that I have to start the proceedings—and I regret this—on a sour note. The Committee and Parliament have been treated most shabbily in relation to this order. When I was consulted—and I do not know whether I am entitled to refer to these matters—on whether this order should be taken in a Standing Committee, I thought that this course was appropriate and would be for the convenience of the House as this was a matter on which there was unlikely to be any substantial difference among hon. Members. There are many questions that we shall want to ask, but it did not appear to me that there was a sufficient parliamentary divide to warrant taking the matter on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am bound to say that I had been under the impression that we were to be given some backing information on the order, which is customary practice for nationalised industries on borrowing power orders to provide to members, so that they have a basis on which to decide whether to vote the additional money to the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been making inquiries and I find that the annual report of the National Coal Board is due out at 10.30 tomorrow morning, yet, just 24 hours beforehand, we are expected to vote another £150
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
million, and the latest report came out a year ago for 1972–73. That is my first ground for complaint, and before I sit down I intend to ask whether the Committee might adjourn so that we could consider the matter after the annual report is out and when we have seen the basis of the Coal Board's figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, when an industry is coming forward with a new strategy for investment involving, as the interim report made clear, an additional £600 million, of which, presumably, this is the first 
	<i>tranche,</i> it is usual for the industry or the Department to present Parliament with a clear, argued case spelling out all the figures, indicating the financial consequences of the proposed spending, and giving all the usual figuring that surrounds a major investment programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I recall rightly, when we presented the 10-year investment programme for steel last year, Parliament had before it a mass of documentation, including a very substantial report prepared by the British Steel Corporation, when it considered the corporation's investment plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have discovered, at a very late hour, that the Coal Board has produced a small PR booklet, and not even the warmest defender of the board's management could conceivably describe it as more than that. It has virtually no figuring in it. It is a document which, perfectly properly—and I make no complaint about this—has been published primarily for the benefit of the Board's own employees. Not only do I make no complaint; I applaud that. It is an entirely proper use of management functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fortunately, I have been able to get a copy of the booklet from the National Union of Mineworkers. The National Coal Board has not sent me a copy. There is no copy in the Library of the House, nor in the Vote Office. If hon. Members have received copies, they have received them from the union, and my gratitude is due to the National Union of Mineworkers for making copies available to myself and to those of my colleagues concerned with energy matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the interim report, but not the final report, of the tripartite talks on the examination of the coal industry, which is a valuable and useful document and I should not want to cast doubts on it. But it does not go within a thousand miles
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
of presenting to the House and the Committee the kind of detailed financial information and statistics to which we are entitled and to which previous Governments always ensured Parliament had access before presenting Parliament with an order of this sort asking for a substantial additional 
	<i>tranche.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in the circumstances, and principally because the National Coal Board's report will be published tomorrow, the Committee should adjourn. We cannot sensibly consider these matters today. We cannot pass the order, although on the overall merits, subject to questions being answered, there is not likely to be a deep division between the two sides of the Committee. But Parliament is the financial watchdog for the country. Parliament decides whether the great State corporations should have access to additional public money from the national loans fund—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) suggests that the Conservative Government fell into the same error. I can assure him that we did not. Before we asked Parliament for additional borrowing powers—and the example that I gave was of the steel industry last year—there was a mass of documentation available for hon. Members which was used and relied upon by hon. Members on both sides of the House before Parliament supported the borrowing for the British Steel Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today we have practically nothing, and in the circumstances the only proper course is for the Committee to adjourn so that the order can be considered at a later stage, with the benefit of such information as the Government would be pleased to let us have in the interim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for the Chair to adjourn the Committee or to postpone further consideration of the order. I would presume that this meeting of the Committee was mutually arranged through the usual channels, and it is therefore a question of whether the members of the Committee wish to move the adjournment of the proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Farr</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. I support my hon. Friend in urging that the Committee should adjourn. I hope that I am in order in pointing out that if all the Opposition Members were to withdraw, there would not be
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
any quorum for the business to be continued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is asking for another £150 million, and Parliament must have some back-up information about the uses to which the money is to be put. It is not for me to tell the Minister the sort of facts and figures that both sides of the Committee—and I emphasise both sides—need. We want to know how much the coal strike cost, and what element of the long coal strike is involved in the £150 million. We also need information, which may be in the report coming out tomorrow, about whether this additional borrowing power is intended to hold the price of coal steady—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not discussing the various merits of the instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree, Sir Myer. I was trying to point out that there is a lack of information which the Committee will probably have tomorrow and which will show some of the reasons for which the money is required. For instance, is it all needed for—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I point out that presumably the Minister, in moving the motion, will give the reasons why there is a need for the borrowing powers. It is to be hoped that he will do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, Sir Myer, the sum involved is £150 million, and I put it to the Committee that it is not good enough to be told by the Minister now. We should have had papers in our hands days ago. We do not have them, and, in the circumstances, I urge the Committee to support my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. T. H. H. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. I am concerned, in fact distressed about this—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Swain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He just thought about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What distresses me even more is that the Minister should have—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has just thought about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) should not interrupt from a sedentary position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:—the Minister should have called us here to discuss an extremely important matter involving £150 million, when the Minister himself knows that tomorrow he is to publish, through the Secretary of State, a most important document which will set out the results of the National Coal Board last year. In my judgment it is nothing short of deception. We do not have the information—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this a point of order or an interruption?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have a point of order on a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) must be patient. It is most important that all the factual information is laid before the Committee. The Minister could help us this morning, and he could be most accommodating. He could say that we should await the publication of the report, so that hon. Members had an opportunity to study the additional detail and make their inquiries over the weekend. We could resume next week, and then the order could be fully investigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minister is saying to the English nation, and to all our constituents, is that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Energy (Mr. Alex Eadie)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The British nation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have, apparently, to discuss this order without knowing what the background detail is. We are deprived of all the information which we require. Is that the right way to run a constitutional democracy? I cannot think that it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another matter which concerns me. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has indicated that he is to borrow the sum of £500 million from the Shah of Persia. That is most important, and I do not know whether the Minister has had an opportunity to inquire from the Chancellor whether the money is to come from Persia to back the British mines. Without going into arguments about whether we should pump money into the mines, I should like to know whether it is to be Persian money, or
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
English cash. Where is it to be borrowed? The Minister will not have the foggiest idea this morning, because he probably has not had an opportunity to discuss the matter with his right hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also rather concerned about another issue, which has appeared in the 
	<i>Financial Times</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must confine himself to the lack of information on this specific statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Sir Myer. Of course, I am extremely concerned about the procedure here. Here we are, upstairs, on a Wednesday, considering the Coal Industry (Borrowing Powers) Order, when on Friday we are to consider the Electricity Order on the Floor of the House. Is that not the right place, so that other people have the opportunity, not merely of expressing their views, but also of using their voting capacity in the appropriate manner? Instead, here we are upstairs, and only a few of us are given the opportunity of spending—on behalf of the country—some £150 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the primary point. I do not wish to delay the matter any longer, but it is not right for the Minister to ask us to consider this most important matter this morning without the fullest information available to us, and without him taking us into his confidence by saying that he will give us the report first, so that we may see the last review of the National Coal Board, and then, on that basis, to ask us to support the investment of this sum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind hon. Members that the House will have the opportunity of voting upon the statutory instrument subsequent to its consideration by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entering into a discussion on the points of order that have been raised, but at this stage we ought to hear what the Minister has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to curb any hon. Gentleman who wants to intervene on a matter arising from a point of order, and I take the point made by the right hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Jenkin) in regretting that he had to introduce the matter on such a sour note. I am quite sure that he did not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
wish to do so. But some of the matters that have been raised have already been discussed in the House. I have heard the speeches by hon. Gentlemen welcoming the interim report, and some information is contained in that interim report. There have been various questions and exchanges across the Floor of the House, dealing with this, and some of the matters raised this morning have been known to the House for a considerable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the right hon. Gentleman, and to his hon. Friends, with all the sincerity that I can command, that I should like always to provide all the information that is available. The Opposition have rights. The parliamentary procedure has been questioned, as has the constitution, and it is not my intention, as one of Her Majesty's Ministers, to try to inflict any damage to the constitution. However, I have no knowledge whatever of any requirement to produce memoranda based on what we are to discuss here this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I understand what the Under-Secretary has just said. Is he suggesting that he should only produce memoranda in response to direct requests from hon. Members and that he has no duty to put information before the House without a request?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well what I said. I shall always try to provide all the information. But it was the right hon. Gentleman who, in the course of his introduction to his point of order, tried to imply that there was a certain requirement to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that I had covered the point. I am aware that the Report of the National Coal Board will be published tomorrow, but it has no relation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it has. This is ridiculous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not shout at the hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Skeet) when he was trying to make his point. I repeat that it has no bearing, and if the debate can proceed, we can begin to demonstrate how it has no bearing. The matters that were raised will be discussed, argued and debated later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members were talking about the cost of the coal strike. The coal strike
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
bears no relation to this borrowing order. It has been dealt with previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Opposition feel aggrieved at times, and it is not my intention to try to take away any of the rights of the Opposition. But of course we cannot adjourn, and, with the permission of the Committee I hope that we can proceed to discuss the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick McNair-Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. We cannot leave the matter quite like that. The duty of Parliament is to husband the taxpayer's money, and we are being asked to authorise a very substantial increase in borrowing powers of £150 million. The Minister, with whom I always associate fairness and reason, must realise that it is quite wrong for us to proceed without written facts and evidence upon which to base our judgment. It is simply not good enough to suggest that we have had vague debates about the subject, and that everybody knows what it is all about. We need chapter and verse to substantiate this extremely large amount of additional borrowing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that it is fashionable to describe Government money as being twopence a bucket, but that bucket is being filled by the taxpayer, and the taxpayer has the right to know for what that money is to be spent. It is irresponsible for any Minister to suggest that this order should go through on the nod when we all know the parlous financial state of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should accept the suggestion which has been put forward by my right hon. and hon. Friends that the matter be adjourned until we are in possession of at least the Coal Board's Annual Report, and we could look at it again perhaps next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One matter that should not be overlooked is that the £700 million in terms of purchasing value is no more than £500 million in 1965.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious that the Minister is not prepared to move the adjournment. May we now proceed with the business?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Sir Myer, but I am afraid that I must be difficult about this. This is not treating Parliament properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to say this to the Under-Secretary. I have had a high regard for his many qualities since he came to the House, but when he comes forward with an order of this sort, with no supporting facts and figures—although I have no doubt whatever that he will do his best to give us the answers to the Questions which we shall want to ask—it is not good enough. It would not be right for us to set a precedent by tamely acquiescing to a procedure which the Opposition regard as wholly unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence that we do not wish to challenge the general drift of the Government's policy on the coal industry is that we agreed that this order should be considered in Committee. But when I agreed this a week or more ago, I did not imagine that we would come into the Committee with no further information at all. I have inquired almost daily at the Library and at the Vote Office about when we would get the necessary supporting documentation, and all that I have is the booklet provided for me by the mineworkers' union. I have been in touch with the National Coal Board. I am delighted that the chairman is at the Palace today, at the investiture for his knighthood, and we offer him our warmest congratulations on that. But I spoke to a member of his staff, and I understand that there has been no request for additional information from the Department of Energy. The board is perhaps unwise in asking the Department to put forward the order without providing Parliament with the necessary documentation. The Department, and the Minister in particular, is being not only unwise, but contemptuous of Parliament in expecting us to pass it without giving us the necessary facts and figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it comes to the substance of the matter, I shall indicate the kinds of facts and figures which Parliament should have before voting a sum of this sort. I do not wish to stray beyond the point of order, but one of the frequent complaints made of our financial proceedings, of which I saw enough in three and a half years at the Treasury, is that Parliament does not have adequate control over the huge sums that are devoted to investment in and the support of the nationalised industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
But one control that we have is on the borrowing powers orders, and when legislation is going through. It is not good enough that we should be asked to pass this order for the final tranche of the £700 million of, not 1965, as I think I can tell the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. Roberts), but 1973, which was when the £700 million was voted in the Coal Industry Act—with no documentation of any sort beyond the interim report, which, although a useful document, does not begin to offer the kind of detail on numbers, returns on capital, cash flow, and all the other things that one needs to know about this which previous Governments have always thought it right to furnish to Parliament before bringing forward orders of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very sorry, Sir Myer. I have the greatest respect for the Chair, and for your occupancy of it, but I do not feel it right to accede to your request. I must ask the Under-Secretary to think about this again. I cannot believe that the Opposition will want to hold up the matter so as to put the National Coal Board into any sort of financial difficulty, but I can realise that it is reaching the limits of its borrowing power. We have no figures on this. We have not been told when the £550 million will run out. There are a number of other questions to which I shall want answers, many of which will have been provided in the documents which the Minister ought to have put before the House before bringing forward this order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must press the Minister again. It would be sensible for the Committee to adjourn until next week when we can consider the matter in the light of perhaps not only the latest annual report of the National Coal Board, to be published tomorrow, but also such further documentation which he thinks it is appropriate that Parliament should have before it considers a matter of this magnitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Coal Industry (Borrowing Powers) Order 1974.</p></blockquote>
Section 2(1) of the Coal Industry Act 1973 substituted a new Section 1(3) of the Coal industry Act 1965 to provide that the limit on the borrowings of the National Coal Board, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, can be raised from an initial £550 million to a total not exceeding £700 million by Statutory instrument. The time has now come to raise the borrowing limit to the full £700 million, and the order is designed to do this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to avoid any confusion, I should, perhaps, emphasise that the borrowing limit has nothing to do with any losses made by the board or with Government assistance to meet those losses. Like any other large private or public industry, the NCB has to engage in major investment projects which do not produce revenue for a number of years and has to borrow to cover the period between capital expenditure and the revenue resulting from the projects. Indeed, the time between beginning to invest in a new mine and full production is very long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background to this order is that one of the first steps taken by the Government was to establish the joint Government-union-Coal Board examination of the future role of the industry. The interim report which was published in June brought to an end more than 10 years of run-down by endorsing the NCB's proposal for a massive increase in its investment. The sum of £600 million
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
is to be spent over the next 10 years on 42 million tons of new capacity derived from new mines and the development of existing ones. This £600 million is on top of previous plans to spend about £80 million a year; in other words, investment will be almost doubled and will amount to about £1,400 million over the next 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the years of run-down and competition from oil, the National Coal Board was unable to build up any reserves. It would be unrealistic now to expect it to finance this expansion programme out of earnings in the next 10 years. No private company would try to bear such a burden. Even if market conditions permitted, financing this crash programme of long-life projects would be an unfair burden on present consumers. The NCB will therefore properly have to borrow much of the money and pay it back over a longer period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, all of us concerned with the industry welcome the fact that the NCB will in the next year or so be paying out compensation to pneumoconiosis sufferers. Negotiations between the Board and the unions are going well and the Government have made it clear that they will contribute towards relieving the board's finances of the burden of the past in respect of existing sufferers. At least the initial payments will be financed by borrowing, and I can assure the Committee there will be no unnecessary delays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The particular timing of the order is governed largely by the board's heavy borrowing needs in the near future. In addition to its rising investment programme and the pneumoconiosis scheme to which I have already referred, the board will need to borrow in order to raise its share of development expenditure on North Sea oil discoveries. Although the board's North Sea oil interests are to be taken over in due course by the proposed British National Oil Corporation, the board meanwhile needs to borrow to raise its share of the finance needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point that the board will have to borrow in order to pay for the expenditure while the assets are being kept, but surely it will sell these assets
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
and a lot of money will fall back into the kitty which can be utilised for the purpose of investment in the mines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All these matters will be the subject of negotiation and Parliament must have it spelt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the board has indicated that it hopes to meet at least a part of these requirements through a foreign currency loan later this year, and as the timing of such a loan cannot yet be determined precisely, it seems only prudent to introduce the present order so that we can ensure that there is no risk of total NCB borrowing even temporarily exceeding the statutory limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made it clear that this order is a routine matter of prudent financial management. It is intended to finance developments which have been welcomed from all sides of the House. I will, of course, pay careful attention to points made by members of the Committee and will seek, with your permission, Sir Myer, to answer them if I am able to catch your eye towards the end of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.3 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bound to say that the Committee is little wiser about any of the needs for which this order is brought forward. I am sorry to have to say to the Under-Secretary that he has made a most inadequate introduction to this debate. Perhaps during the course of my remarks, which I hope will not be too long, he will become aware of some of the questions to which we should have been given answers before the debate began, so that we could consider this matter in a proper context and with a knowledge of the financial background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All we have been told, which is a matter of simple common sense, is that a body such as the National Coal Board financing a great expansion of capital expenditure cannot be expected to do so out of revenue. Of course, I accept that. We are also told that it is a mere matter of common prudence to bring this order before the House now so as to avoid the risk of the Coal Board running over its borrowing limit before the necessary legislation is introduced in the new Session to support the Government's plan for the coal industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
That is all we have been told. However, I hope that by the time this debate finishes, whether today or on a later occasion, the Committee will know a great deal more about the facts and figures underlying the present order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one thing which I should take up with the hon. Gentleman—and here I am making a wholly non-party point. He referred to the 10-year rundown of the coal industry, although I suspect that it is rather longer. But I honestly do not think that Governments of either party need to don the white sheet and talk about running down the coal industry, castigating themselves for lack of foresight. On the contrary, Governments of both parties did an enormous amount and spent large sums of the taxpayers' money in slowing the rundown of the coal industry during the period of security and abundance of oil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We took massive action to prevent the industry from running down much faster than it did. One has only to indicate the measures that were taken: the fuel oil tax introduced in 1953; the ban on imports of foreign coal when we could have had much cheaper Russian or American coal; substantial revenue subsidies of various kinds, to which I shall come in a moment. All these were intended to slow down what was seen at the time by Governments of all parties to be a long-term trend in coal as against other forms of energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative Government did a great deal in the 1973 Act. Perhaps that Act was the high water mark of Government support for the coal industry, in order to make sure that its rundown was slower and accompanied by far less social deprivation than would otherwise have been the case. The 1973 Act followed extensive consultations between the miners' union and the Coal Board, and subsequently with the Government. It ushered in what was then seen as a new era of joint participation in the management of the industry. Wholly new procedures were set up. There was a joint review of collieries to examine the question of economic closures. There was the agreement that real increases in wages should come from increased productivity. A joint sales programme was set up. Every member of the industry was encouraged to become
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0586">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
a salesman for coal. There was the Joint Policy Advisory Committee whereby the union at all levels was given the opportunity to comment on policies that were being pursued and proposed by the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last Government weighed in with massive financial support. Capital was written off to the tune of £475 million. Over the five years from 1973 to 1978, Government support for social costs will amount to nearly a quarter of a billion pounds; £100 million was provided for additional coal-burn by the generating authorities; £110 million was to be provided for extra coal stocks; £45 million was to be provided for additional coking coal subsidy; and over £200 million for regional grants specifically to support the Coal Board's activities in the peripheral areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South (Mr. Boardman) the then Minister for Industry, said when speaking to a Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments, on 18th July 1973:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With the Coal Industry Act and now with the formulation of the new scheme the Government have fulfilled their undertaking to provide a new framework in which the industry can work towards the resolution of its problems. We may fairly claim to have given the industry the tools to enable it to establish itself on a secure, long-term basis and to make an appropriate contribution to the country's energy needs."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments,</i> 18th July 1973; c. 10.]</p></blockquote>
That was in July 1973, almost exactly a year ago. I have been re-reading the debates on the 1973 Act, and one is very struck by the unanimity which united both sides of the House and the Committee when the Act was introduced. The measure was supported by the present Secretary of State, who was then leading for the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How short-lived proved to be that euphoria of 1973. By the end of the year the industry, first as the result of the overtime ban and then of the complete stoppage, had brought the country perilously near its knees, had provoked a General Election, and had contributed to the fall of a democratically elected Government. I do not want to go over past history, as we must look to the future. Here we are again with another great plan for the coal industry, this time the Coal Board's ambitious "Plan for Coal", which has been endorsed, as the hon. Gentleman has
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
already mentioned, by the interim report of the Coal Industry Examination. Once again we are faced with a massive new injection of money, with capital investment rising by an additional £600 million over the 10 years 1974–84. There are in addition further important social advances with the proposals for pneumoconiosis, which all of us must welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very tempting to sing the song, "Tell us the old, old story", but I believe—and here I hope I shall carry the whole Committee with me—that it would be totally wrong, as we are now in an entirely new situation so far as the coal industry is concerned, to say that conditions today are the same as they were a year ago and that this is merely the industry coming back for yet further financial support. Following the massive rise in oil prices, the future of the coal industry has been entirely transformed, from having to be an industry subsidised by the taxpayer on a very substantial scale in order to stay in business at all and always taking a smaller and smaller share of the country's rising energy consumption, to one which can now look forward to an era in which it can compete fairly and freely without having to rely on subsidies to any substantial extent from the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coal is now, and can remain if sensible policies are pursued, fully competitive with oil. It cannot, of course, in the long run be competitive with nuclear power, as nuclear Dower is now 40 or 50 per cent. cheaper than power based on fossil fuels. We now know, however, that the Government are proposing only a small pilot programme of nucler generation—a mere 1,000 megawatts additional a year over the next four years; therefore, it will have a relatively minor impact upon the demand for fossil fuels. That is a matter which we shall be able to explore when we debate the Electricity Borrowing Powers Order on the Floor of the House on Friday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point of substance that I should like to make arising out of this brief incursion into the history of the matter is this—and I hope the Minister will be able to confirm this, as it is exactly the kind of detail that I had hoped we might have had before this debate: is this new injection of capital to a very substantial extent in substitution for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
the revenue subsidies that had to be provided under the 1973 Act? There really is no reason now for a subsidy for additional coal-burn. Indeed, as the Electricity Generating Board Chairman told the Select Committee the other day, he cannot even now get all the coal he would like to burn from the National Coal Board. Presumably, therefore, an additional subsidy for coal-burn is out and that money is not needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is then the question of extra stocks. Surely there is now no need for the taxpayer to finance extra stocks of coal. Apart from anything else, I shall say in a moment that stocks of coal are still at a rather parlous level. On the extra subsidy for coking coal, the Chairman of the British Steel Corporation has recently gone on record complaining that he cannot get enough coking coal from the National Coal Board. Here, too, there seems to be no reason to pay the subsidies for which the 1973 legislation provided. Then there were the £210 million regional grants. I should have thought that almost the whole of that is now no longer necessary, and that the coal from the great majority, even of the peripheral coal mines, should now be being mined economically and that the revenues flowing to the Coal Board should be sufficient to match the cost of getting it. I recognise that there may be at the fringe a few particular pits and areas where even now, despite the very substantial rise in the price of coal, both in the past and in the one coming in the autumn, the coal mined is uneconomic and some marginal measure of revenue support may be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the industry ought now to be able to bear more of its current social costs—and I draw a very clear distinction between the need to bear its current costs, which is recognised in the interim report, particularly on making provision for future sufferers of pneumoconiosis, and the need to deal with the problems of past sufferers, those who are suing or might sue the Coal Board, and also for redundancy and pension payments and other things of that sort for which totally inadequate provision was made in the past and for which it would be unrealistic to expect the Board to make the necessary provision out of current revenues. Current and future social costs
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
can presumably also be reckoned to be provided for out of the current revenues of the Coal Board in the new situation in which it finds itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making a very good point, but on the question of respiratory diseases he is aware that under Article 55 of the ECS Treaty a sum of £400,000 is being provided to deal with this specific matter. Obviously, it would not all have to come out of the current account of the National Coal Board, but any aid which comes from Europe is extremely salutory in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and indeed the House was impressed on Monday at Question Time with the amount and variety of support which is now flowing to the coal industry as a result of our membership of the European Communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to my central question. I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to give the Committee a very clear answer indeed. How much of the revenue subsidies provided for the coal industry under the 1973 Act are now no longer necessary? To what extent is the new capital provision, in this order and in the legislation which is to come in the next session, in substitution for the revenue subsidies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point which I should like to explore briefly is the question of productivity. I will begin with a statement with which nobody could possibly disagree, in the foreword to the Interim Report by the Secretary of State for Energy, at paragraph 8:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All of us want a thriving coal industry, offering proper rewards to those who work in it, and this is now a perfectly realisable prospect. But for mineworkers, as for … other workers … real rewards can advance to the extent that they reflect higher efficiency and higher ouput per man.'</p></blockquote>
Nobody would dispute that. That must be the right answer. Indeed, that was exactly what was agreed by the unions following the tripartite talks last year. After the 1972 stoppage, indeed, one of the really encouraging things was the extent to which productivity increased substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter was brought out very clearly in last year's Annual Report of the National Coal Board. I quote from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0588">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
the introduction to the Report, where it says that after the strike had ended:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What then happened was possibly one of the most remarkable examples of industrial cooperation in recent times. Both management and unions committed themselves to restoring the strength of the industry and confidence in it."</p></blockquote>
The introduction continued later:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Productivity was exceeding last year's by a healthy margin and frequently reached record levels. Outputs were good. Consumers' stocks had quickly been restored to safe levels and coal sales continued strong."</p></blockquote>
That was indeed very encouraging following the 1972 strike in the industry, but let us see what has been happening this year, in 1974, following the disastrous dispute of last winter. The exact opposite has been happening, and this, I should have thought, must be a matter for very grave concern in all parts of the community. The figures are published in arrear, so one may not be wholly up to date. Compared with the productivity figures of over 48 cwt. of output per man shift, taking the total manpower in the pits, the figure for April of this year was 41·9 cwt.; for May, it had risen to 44·6 cwt.; for June, as we were told by the Secretary of State at Question Time on Monday, it was back to 43·8 cwt. Therefore, output is now probably between 10 and 11 per cent. below what it was during the comparable period of 1973. Far from recovering, therefore, output now is running substantially below what it was last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State, when questioned about this matter in the House—and as I have not got HANSARD I am relying on 
	<i>The Times</i>—said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One reason why output has been disappointing is because of the delays in development work during last years industrial troubles."</p></blockquote>
Obviously this must be so; there were no safety and maintenance men working during this strike and, therefore, this will have set the matter back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am, however, bound to tell the Committee that from my inquiries this is not the whole answer. I hope that the Minister in his reply will be able to be a little more forthcoming, as this matter is giving rise to a great deal of concern in the industry. I suggest to him that possibly one answer—and it is a very human one which we would understand, even if we are not wholly sympathetic to it—is that the union and the Board are discussing
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
he need for the introduction of new productivity arrangements and incentive schemes. Does the Minister believe that there is any element of seeking to establish a relatively modest base line upon which productivity arrangements might be expected to operate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A bargaining posture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there some other reason apart from, I concede, the difficulties in getting machinery and equipment back into full production after the absence of any safety and maintenance work during the strike?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must ask, if this was the only cause, whether one would not see month by month a gradual catching up on the productivity figures of last year, whereas the figures I have quoted show that the June figure was lower than the May figure. Has the Minister any more up-to-date figures—those for the following four weeks? This is disquieting, and is causing concern in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the results of this, to move on to the next point, is the question of stocks. The passage that I quoted from last year's Report showed that one of the benefits of the tremendous boost in productivity which had followed the previous strike was that stocks built up very rapidly, whereas—and I only have the report of 26th June: perhaps the Minister can tell us when his Department's monthly statement is coming out giving the latest figures—compared with May 1973, when undistributed stocks of coal were 12·9 million tonnes, the figure for May 1974 was 7·6. The figure for power station stocks for May 1973 was 16·8 and for May 1974 9·9.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is not really dealing with borrowing powers at all. The facts that he is pouring out now concerning stocks are known to the public. We are dealing here with borrowing powers. The problems which the hon. Gentleman is trying to explain are known to us and the National Coal Board must get over them. What we are doing this morning is making sure that we can get over them by having the necessary borrowing powers to deal with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept what the hon. Gentleman says. He knows an enormous amount about this industry and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
he is making a perfectly fair point. I think, equally, that I am entitled to ask for the more up-to-date figures on productivity and on stocks. All these things are of immense importance. The main point I am making is that they contrast so markedly with the record of the industry when the previous Government had to pick up the bits after the 1972–73 strike, and established their policy with the Coal Industry Act for the massive financial support which I have already outlined to the Committee. The situation this year in disquietingly different, and I am asking the Under-Secretary to what he ascribes that and what he intends to do about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leading on from the stocks position, we hope and pray that we shall not have a confrontation with the miners' union this winter. I believe that great efforts are being made by both sides to try to avoid another disastrous confrontation. If such a thing did occur, the country, and the electricity generating industry in particular, would be singularly ill-equipped to go into the sort of dispute which could result in an interruption in the supplies of coal during the winter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of productivity, everybody agrees that there is a need for a scheme or schemes to relate financial reward much more closely to direct output.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dunfermline (Mr. Hunter) does not; I shall be interested to hear his views. Certainly those with whom I have spoken in the unions and in management, and those outside who are concerned with the industry, all agree that, although the rationalisation of the pay structure which was carried out under Lord Robens' chairmanship was necessary and overdue at the time it was made, the fact that this eliminated any form of incentive payment is now recognised as a mistake and it is time that something was done about it. This was recognised in the interim report and at the miners' conference in Llandudno.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that the talks are proceeding smoothly and satisfactorily and that there is every prospect that a satisfactory scheme will be introduced before the end of the year. I wish the talks every suc-
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
cess, because I agree wholeheartedly with the Secretary of State in the foreword to the report, that additional payment must be based upon improved productivity. Those to whom I speak in the miners' union are confident that there will be a substantial boost in output when payment—particularly for face workers and those underground—is more closely related to the levels of output. This is of the utmost importance to the industry, as every statement about it has made clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the National Coal Board's Plant for Coal. Here we are not told nearly enough about what is envisaged. This is the point of the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. Roberts), who will no doubt follow closely what I say about this. This is what we are asked to support by recommending that this order should be passed by the House.

I presume from what is stated in the interim report that the Government have broadly endorsed in principle the Coal Board's proposals which involve this neat, round sum of an additional £600 million of capital spending over the next 10 years. I presume, equally—and I ask the Under-Secretary to confirm this in clear, unequivocal language—that the Government have not yet approved the individual details of the National Coal Board's proposals and that they will not approve them until they are satisfied on a number of important financial criteria. They should be satisfied that the money will be well and wisely spent and that it will earn the revenues on which the board will increasingly depend for meeting, not only all its current outgoings, but its future investment needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a number of questions on this matter which I have no doubt the Under-Secretary will be able to answer because this must be part of the Government's appraisal of the National Coal Board's proposals. What are the financial criteria that are being applied to this investment? Are they the normal financial criteria applied to investments in the nationalised industries in the public sector generally, or is the board to be subjected to a different series of criteria?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, will this investment by the National Coal Board be subject to the standard test discount rate—the TDR —for public sector borrowing generally? Or will there be a different, and perhaps
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
less stringent, criterion applied to the board's investment? If it is to be less stringent, will the Minister explain to the Committee why this should be so? What are the characteristics of this industry which would justify less stringent financial criteria for investment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second question I should like to ask is: what is the internal procedure in the Government that is being adopted to scrutinise this major increase in the National Coal Board's investment plans? He will know something of the procedure of the previous Government when we had a comparable plan put forward by the steel industry, with a major review, leading to a final review by Cabinet Ministers at a meeting chaired by the Prime Minister at which the industry made a full presentation of its financial plans, which in the end were accepted by the Government and then put forward in Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, what information will be given to Parliament about the financial implications of the National Coal Board's proposals? In particular, is the board drawing up a corporate plan and, if so, will it be made available to Parliament? This brings me back to the point where I asked that we should consider this matter on a later occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the questions to which Parliament needs to have answers before we can safely recommend this order to the House. We must have the facts, the figures and the analyses to support them in order to justify our approving this order. I do not think it is right for the Government to ask Parliament to take figures of this sort on trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to one or two of the details which are known about the plan. I warmly endorse the proposal to develop the Selby coalfield. As the hon. Gentleman is such an assiduous reader of my speeches—and I am grateful for the credit he does me—he will know that every time I make a speech about coal I am concerned to tell the public what an enormously valuable asset the National Coal Board has in the Selby coalfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman. It is a fact that Selby coalfield is more valuable than all the finds of oil that have been made in the North Sea. It is coal of an unequalled purity, with a 1 per cent. sulphur and 1 per cent. ash content. It is so rich that it will have to be blended with ordinary coal to be burned in our power stations, unless the power stations are adapted to take it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only is the Selby coalfield immensely rich; it is very accessible, being 900 feet down. It can be mined by drift mining, although some shafts will be necessary for ventilation and for materials and manpower. The coal will be brought out on conveyor belts, perhaps four belts to each drift. Therefore, it should not be many years before we have 10 million tons a year being extracted from the Selby coalfield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this is perhaps the best talisman for the future of the coal industry. There is this enormous resource of coal, and it is not only in Selby. There are new discoveries in the South Staffordshire coalfield. There are new discoveries in the Nottinghamshire coalfield. There is supposed to be—though perhaps I should not probe too deeply about this—coal in North Oxfordshire. Britain is immensely rich in coal and therefore I am wholly behind anybody who argues that the coal industry has a leading role to play in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
the future energy requirements of the country. But it must at the same time stand by the country and the industry must assure the degree of security in coal supplies which the nation is entitled to expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask only one question about Selby. Is it the intention of the National Coal Board to leave pillars of coal under the villages in Yorkshire which stand over this coalfield? The amount of coal is so vast that the percentage losses by not allowing this subsidence to take place must be relatively small. This is a matter which is causing considerable anxiety to people who live in the area, and I hope the Minister will be able to give a reassuring answer to this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the matter of coal prices. I hope the Minister will be able to tell us something more about this. If it is the general policy towards the industry that it should now be able to compete fairly and freely with other forms of energy and stand on its own feet, then it will need to ensure adequate revenue from the coal that is being sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister in a position to tell us more about the autumn price rise for coal? We have not had any information about the structure of this price rise and people are beginning to ask how this will be apportioned as between the different users of coal. What will be the effect on the price of electricity? Are we to have another rise in the price of electricity as a result of the rise in the price of coal? This is something which must be determined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Government's attitude to a uniform national tariff for coal? Are the Government prepared to support the moves which the industry has been making to establish a national tariff across the board for coal? One of the sources of discontent, particularly in Scotland—and I know the hon. Member for Dunfermline will endorse this—is that coal in Scotland has been significantly more expensive than coal in many other parts of the United Kingdom. That has militated against the regional policy of successive Governments in trying to get industry to disperse to Scotland and other development areas. Will the Government support the coal industry when it tries to get a more national price structure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
The matter of coal products is equally important. One of the major debates in the Standing Committee on the 1973 Act was about how far the National Coal Board's borrowing resources would be used to support the coal products, their subsidiaries. How much of this money will be used for coal products? We recognise that the board has suffered a very severe setback, through the dreadful Flixborough disaster, and we extend our sympathy to those involved in it. But can the Minister tell us something about the impact of this upon the finances of the coal products side of the National Coal Board's activities, and can he say how much of the money that we are now being asked to vote to the board will go into coal products as opposed to how much will go into the direct production of coal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We note with approval and, indeed, delight the very satisfactory agreement that the Coal Board has made with the Americans on research and development for coal products. Can the Minister tell us anything more about it? Will it involve the Coal Board in further investment in downstream activities in the use of coal, and what are they likely to be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I come to the question of Europe. One thing which emerged last year was a general agreement about the position of the coal industry in the European Economic Community, but we learn from the papers this morning—my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Mr. Skeet) may wish to probe this more deeply—that the Government are not prepared to agree to the Commission's proposals for an energy policy in Europe. "Towards a new energy policy strategy for the European Community"—that is what the Commission's paper is about. Why do the Government not support these objectives? Or is it merely, as is suggested in one newspaper, that they want more time? What is the element to which the Government object? It clearly represents a considerable setback for the evolution of a common energy policy for Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chairman of the Coal Board is an ardent supporter of Britain's membership of the Community, and it would be most unfortunate if the British coal industry, which is by far the largest in Europe and will account for well over half the total European production of coal over
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
the next decade, does not play its full part in developing a proper European policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate has provided and will continue to provide an opportunity—and, no doubt, my hon. Friends will have other questions—for the Government to explain their policy much more fully than anything that we have had so far, whether from the interim statement or from the statement of the Secretary of State on the Floor of the House. I hope I have made it clear that there is much in the Government's policy which the Opposition are happy to endorse and agree with, but we must be given the answers to what I hope have been considered pertinent and relevant questions. I apologise for taking the Committee's time, but this is an immensely important matter, and, without wishing to trample over the ground which we covered at the beginning of the debate, I hope that the Under-Secretary, who, as he said, is always anxious to make sure that the House is provided with all the information we ask for when we are considering matters of this sort, will do his best to answer my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

A number of hon. Members rose on points of order in the first half-hour, and my hon. Friend has had only seven minutes in which to reply, so I know that I must curtail my remarks to give other hon. Members an opportunity. I am looking forward to hearing the usual lot of nonsense from the hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Skeet). He is gabbling away like a pea in a barrel and is not prepared to listen to anybody else. He wants to intervene at every opportunity.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate my hon. Friend on the fact that the Government, at long last, are dealing with the serious question of pneumoconiosis cases. Regrettably it has not been done before now, but we are all pleased to see that it is being catered for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The incentive bonus that is talked about is in the early stages of negotiation with the National Coal Board, and I think that it would be ill-becoming of this Committee to try to discuss the details that the Joint National Negotiating Committee is discussing, or any possible results. Let us wish it the greatest success in its discussions and hope that something comes out of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disturbed to hear an oblique reference by the right hon. Gentleman to what I interpreted as an accusation of ca'canny. His ill-informed sources had told him that the moment incentive bonuses were agreed on there would be a jumping out. On this occasion I believe that the right hon. Gentleman has not done his homework, and he should look seriously and in depth at what has happened. His Government were responsible for two major stoppages in the industry, which have taken a long time to get over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason why output overall is down now is that this time last year 9 per cent. of the total face work force was employed on development, and because of the industrial strike which was caused, not by the Coal Board or the men, but by the last Government—of which the right hon. Gentleman was a responsible member, though he did not carry out his duties with a great deal of responsibility when it came to the miners' strike—at present, 11 per cent. of the face work force is engaged in development. Development workers do not produce as much coal per manshift as the face workers with the long-wall face machines. As a consequence our total output is down. This 2 per cent. difference can have a considerable effect on the total output of the mining industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one reason why output is down at the moment. The Coal Board and the union are discussing it from pit level to national level, and we know that soon we shall be back to normal. Regrettably,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
stocks are down and must be built up, particularly at the power stations, to a healthy position, and the Government, the Coal Board, and the union are doing everything in their power to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ought to welcome this order. There is a practical point which the right hon. Gentleman is not expected to know. He would not know the difference between a blister and a sister when it came to coal mining. The practical point is that coal mining does not build up its own reserves, and we are constantly having to research, bore holes and look for new fields of coal and develop them. Looking at the cost of developing a new pit and the amount of coal that must be produced from it before it has paid for its own development, it is a long time before that is achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the reasons why I welcome this order. The money will be well spent. I appreciate this statutory instrument. If there is one party in Great Britain that appreciates that money spent by the Government is taxpayers' money, it is the Labour Party; and the Labour Party, thank heaven, has tried to channel it into its right courses; £500 million—[

Gentleman should already know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman prided his Government on the measures of July last year. Is he aware that those measures took place immediately after the miners' conference? The Government of the day knew what resolutions had been passed. The determination of the National Union of Mineworkers to get a fair deal for its members was shown in the resolutions passed at the annual conference, and con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
sequently they talked in an atmosphere of knowledge. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will not see fit to divide this morning and that the Order goes through. We hope that the mining industry gets back to normal at the earliest possible moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the discovery of coal in Oxfordshire is a cert. It may be as rich as Selby, and let us hope that the Oxford discovery is as praiseworthy as we learn today that Selby has been. At the rate of extraction, the Selby discovery can only be short-term, until the turn of the century, and then we shall have to go somewhere else. I hope and trust that such discoveries will take place and that coal in the future will be given its rightful place in an overall energy policy for the first time, and that we shall not have the ups and downs in the industry that we have had to suffer in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My right hon. Friend mentioned the European policy. I should like to ask the Minister why the Government have sought to veto this one in the general strategy, for I think it was very important. May I read from page 22 of the document entitled "Towards a new energy policy strategy for the European Community". It says something with which I entirely agree:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Coal consumption in this sector could, therefore, increase dynamically, thereby offering the best prospect for reducing the Community dependence on oil imports."</p></blockquote>
That is, oil imports from outside the Community.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
But I am disturbed about one thing. The Chancellor of the Exchequer indicated that he was raising from the Shah of Persia no less than £500 million as a line of credit, which is being made available to the nationalised industries. We have no indication at this stage whether it is being made available to the National Coal Board; I think we should know this, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will say something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we bear in mind that borrowing powers will be raised by £50 million by this Order, I wondered whether there were any claw-back credits. I say this with some diffidence, because I am aware that the National Coal Board has made some particularly good investments in the North Sea. I jotted down on a piece of paper precisely what they were. The Dunlim extension 211/24 is the block Conoco/Gulf/NCB. Expected production there is 200,000 barrels a day. The Hutton field 211/28, by the same consortia, is likely to have about the same production at the peak period. More recently there is the Thistle extension 211/19, by the same consortia, and in the English basin there is the Viking field 49/12 by Conoco and the NCB and also an unnamed field, 49/22, by Conoco, the NCB and Mobil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly if it is to be the intention to sell these back to some other state corporation, which would appear to be the answer to my question yesterday, there will be considerable claw-back into the funds which would be available to the National Coal Board in its plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary can probably tell us whether the NCB is to be compensated at the costs incurred or is it to be given market value for its assets? We are entitled to know that today. If it is to be given market value for its assets, it is an enormous sum. It would account for a large part of the £150 million we are talking about today. It is a preliminary matter that should be raised now before we even pass this order. It would also be of interest to all the other people concerned, because they want to know exactly how they are to be treated. If we are told that the National Coal Board will receive in compensation only what it has spent, it is not being treated fairly. I hope the National Union of Mineworkers will have some say, because it will have been seriously let down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
I turn to the aspect of how the money is to be spent. The Minister has given me one answer. He has mentioned that the National Coal Board will be called upon to make a certain contribution to development expenditure in some of these fields, particularly the Dunlin, Hutton and Thistle. Then there is the claw-back I have mentioned. The hon. Gentleman has not indicated what the liability of the National Coal Board is for the new structure to go up for the Nypro works at Flixborough. The unfortunate fire at the caprolactam facilities, which are jointly owned with the Dutch State mines will be an extremely expensive liability. Does the National Coal Board propose to sever its interests in this facility, or does it propose to pay the full amount of liability for the new structure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like a round figure, too, for what the hon. Gentleman estimates to be the contribution which the National Coal Board will be called upon to make to Conoco and the Gulf Oil Corporation in the North Sea developments. We have no figure. Will it appear in the report which is due for publication tomorrow?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another significant point in the future of coal—I say this in all earnestness—is the amount to be spent on research and development. I have been impresesd over the years by the way in which the British Gas Corporation, formerly the Gas Council, has spent a great deal of money on working out methods to produce lean and enriched gas and it has been able to license a number of companies all over the world. I think, too, due to the research that has been undertaken with the United States Bureau of Mines and others, that this could be quite profitable on the licensing side to the National Coal Board. We should know initially what amount of money is going into research and development. I should have thought a large amount of money would be earmarked for this purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those specific matters might be of considerable use to us. All my colleagues will be concerned about the suggestions that have been made in the past that wages have to be put up considerably. While we welcome that there is a clear line of demarcation between the prices which are charged on the open market for oil and coal, it may narrow considerably if wages increase. I have heard it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
said that £100 a week is a reasonable figure. If it is the market rate, it is the market rate. Others have suggested a more modest figure of £65.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gas industry is capital intensive, and so is the oil industry. The coal mining industry is labour intensive. If labour costs go up significantly over the years, all the advantages of Selby could be lost. My right hon. Friend is perfectly right in saying that the jewel in the crown of the National Coal Board is Selby and the other fields that are available, which are the thick seams with the low sulphur content. If mining costs rise significantly over the years, will not the differential between the fields so diminish that they will not be available at the right time?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to some of the facts that my right hon. Friend mentioned. These are brought out clearly in the United Kingdom Energy Statistics, where we find that the output of the miner per man-shift has been falling since the time of the shut-down. Some people rely upon the output per man shift as the test. I have always thought that if one makes international comparisons, output per man-year is probably the better test. Table 22 in this publication shows that it was improving. We can expect an improvement, because the mechanisation of the mines is well over 90 per cent. Some very good equipment is going in. Lord Robens used to talk about 240 million tons productive capacity. Things have moved on since then, certainly in mechanisation. He was the king of mechanisation. He brought in a lot of equipment. Hon. Members opposite would be the first to concede that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have learned this morning that, unfortunately, the output per man shift has gone down. I prefer to put it on this basis: that the miners are trying to negotiate themselves into a position where they will get a much better bargain when they negotiate with the National Coal Board. This is not unique to the mining industry; it is common to industry in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the case, I should like an assurance from the Minister that once the productivity arrangement is negotiated—and I hope that it will soon be completed because, it is essential to the country—that they will get back to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
high figure of 47·66 cwt. that they achieved in May 1973. That was a very good figure. I see the possibility of attaining even 54 cwt. That is quite conceivable. When one bears in mind that the board will lose about 4 million tons per year through declining pits and pits going out of existence through exhaustion, there will have to be a lot of forthcoming new capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am perturbed when I read what was said by Mr. Hawkins, the Chairman of the CEGB, in the 
	<i>Financial Times,</i> a most respectable paper to which every hon. Member would give credence. The report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Hawkins also warned that the CEGB would be short of the equivalent of at least 15–20 million tons of coal a year by 1985, in spite of the National Coal Board's investment programme. This gap would have to be met either by imports or by a substantial increase in power stations' oil-burning capacity."</p></blockquote>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to hear the hon. Gentleman's answers to the questions which have been posed. It is a question of the availability of coal. I wish the miners would realise that the Opposition want to see a successful coal industry. We want them to try to meet the requirements of the CEGB, which is its best market. Fifty-eight per cent. of its market is in the electricity industry. But an expert, the Chairman of the CEGB, says that he feels that there will be a shortfall by 1985 of 15 to 20 million tons. Is it capable of building up its output per man shift? If it is, if it can do it by recruitment, by a little more mechanisation, and by will power and determination in the pits, then I think this money will be well spent.

	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
having some experience in mining and coal production. I remember Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd, as he then was, making speeches in 1953, saying that the horizon would be ever golden for the mining industry. By 1957 we were stocking coal at 10 shillings a ton. It is true that we are all guilty of allowing the coal industry to run down. Our output of coal in the early 1950s was creeping on to 300 million tons a year. Now we are down to approximately 120 million tons a year. This is one of the great tragedies.

	<br><blockquote><p>We are not here to dot the "i's" and cross the "t's".</p></blockquote>
I have a good deal of sympathy for my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary who has to answer some of these questions. Forecasting in the mining industry is hazardous. I have heard forecasts made by both sides that have been entirely wrong. Millions and millions of pounds have been unaccounted for and spent on nuclear energy development. It used to be said in the House that nuclear energy would achieve parity with coal by 1965. Of course, it never has. I wish to prove how hazardous it is to make these points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, let me deal with the question of spending money, bringing young people into the industry, and increasing production. We have got to bring recruitment into the Selby area, and the National Coal Board is already doing this. One must therefore offer inducements which means better wages, better conditions, and pensions. Coal is our indigenous fuel. If we wish to exploit it to the best of our ability, we must have the necessary people and capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question why tonnage is down has already been mentioned, but I want to give the assurance that we are all anxious to ensure that the output per manshift increases. We must try to develop a good relationship between the public, the National Coal Board, and the men who work in the industry. That is so important. We are all anxious because the wellbeing of the country depends on this. The development of coal seams in other parts of the country is unpredictable. It is not like building a factory, where one puts in a certain machine which will turn out so many cans of something per hour. This cannot be done in the mining industry. I have worked in the industry. I know that one can go in with the best intentions
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
but those intentions cannot always be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Opposition will be tolerant about this. The members of the Government here, who have all been connected with the mining industry, are very anxious, not only on behalf of the miners but on behalf of the general public and of the country. This is what we need. But I have the common sense to realise that to satisfy those in the industry many things will have to be done. That is why I say that we must have confidence in and sympathy with those who are dealing with this very vexed problem. I wish that we had more time to deal with the illuminating points raised by my hon. Friend. We like a good debate on the coal industry; it always creates interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Farr</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want first to raise a point of order. It is a matter which has been discussed in the House quite a lot recently. I understand that people who have a financial interest in any aspect of the coal industry at the moment should declare that interest. This morning we have had two excellent speeches from back bench Members on the Government side, and I hope I am right in assuming that neither has any financial interest in the coal industry at the moment and that neither is amongst that qualified team of financially supported trade unionists financed by the NUM.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made that point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask hon. Members to remember that we are finishing at 12.35 p.m. As the hon. Member rightly points out, it is the duty of any hon. Member who has an interest to declare it, but that responsibility rests upon the Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Myer. I was going on to say that as there is a silence on the benches opposite, one assumes that neither of the two Members has any financial interest or any form of financial support whatsoever from the NUM.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I am very sorry that I did not declare my interest. The plain fact is that I did not do so, for the sake of brevity. My interest is that I get £200 from my trade union per year; I have got two sons,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
three sons-in-law, four nephews and two grandsons working down the pit. That is the interest I have in the mining industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It helps the Committee, and I mention it only because last week I was called to order in exactly the same way by an hon. Member on the other side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Minister wishes to get up to speak in a moment, so I will abbreviate what I had intended to say. Not all of us on this side of the Committee, because we in Britain are lucky enough to have what my right hon. Friend describes as probably the best quality coal in the world, after the events of the recent two successive winters feel that it is absolutely incumbent on the nation and the National Coal Board to extract that coal from where it lies as quickly as possible. A lot of us would like to see more money spent on developing our new fields of nuclear energy, greater effort spent in getting North Sea oil and perhaps not quite so much money spent on the National Coal Board. It borrowed £700 million under the 1965 Act, and I am quite sure it will be along in a very short time to borrow another considerable sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nation has learned in the last two winters that coal is an unreliable fuel inasmuch as those who extract it from the ground, regardless of any agreement they have made, tend to go on strike and hold the nation to ransom. We should like to see not quite so much emphasis placed on getting coal out of the ground regardless of cost. Perhaps it would not be a bad thing if it were left to lie there, in rather the same way as some of those in the Arabian countries are thinking of leaving oil.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the time available, I will try to answer as many of the points raised in the debate as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contribution made by the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr) wag grossly unfair. It is not objective to make allegations that the mining industry is unreliable which cannot be substantiated by fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two last industrial actions illustrated that the responsibility probably lies more with the Opposition than with my hon. Friends. The 1972 industrial
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
action was the first we have had in the mining industry nationally since 1926. If the hon. Gentleman wants to be objective and to put prejudice aside, he should not make allegations which cannot be substantiated by fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman wants to quarrel, it is probably fairer that he should quarrel with his right hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Jenkin), who espoused a philosophy in relation to the future of coal to which I am sure I and my hon. Friends would subscribe. He said that we had entered a new coal situation and that the mining industry had a new prospect when we equated the cost of our own indigenous resource with the new rise in oil prices. In general, what he said would find favour with the majority of hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He mentioned what the administration of which he was a member had done for the mining industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does not the Minister answer our question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am answering the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman said that he hoped that we would agree that the 1973 Act was a good measure. I and my hon. Friends would certainly agree that it was a good measure. He mentioned my hon. Friend the Member for Ince (Mr. McGuire). Surely the right hon. Gentleman must concede that, although it was a good measure, it was still concerned with the philosophy of the rundown in the mining industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much still stands?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman asks from a sedentary position how much still stands. I am saying that it was a good measure, but we had no Middle East war to shock this country into realising that we should develop our own indigenous resources because no industrial country can hope to become a great industrial country unless it has its own indigenous supplies of energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1973 Act was a good measure, but the philosophy underlying the Act, however good its intention, was the contraction of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and I seem to have conducted some sort of auction sale in relation to Selby. I do not know whether he has been there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0598">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will answer the specific question about how much of the provision that was made in the 1973 Act will not now be needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should say that quite a lot of the provision made in the 1973 Act will still have some application at the present time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tell us the exact figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may be allowed to make my own speech—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have time, I shall come in more detail to what the hon. Gentleman wanted to espouse in relation to the 1973 Act. However, may I deal with the question of Selby, because it is very important and it is important that the right hon. Member should convince his hon Friends on the importance of Selby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman has been to Selby, but I have. I was as impressed about the new Selby find as the right hon. Gentleman. It was proper that the right hon. Gentleman should ask me a specific question about Selby because there are people in the surrounding area who must have answers to their problems. The point that the right hon. Gentleman asked me was this: in the development of Selby, although all the technology that the National Coal Board can command will go into the development not just of this new mine but of the new coalfield, can assurances be given that there will be no risk of subsidence, and so on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Myer. Are we not entitled to know from the Minister how the £150 million is being allocated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that that is not a point of order. The Minister will answer as he sees fit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it strange that the hon. Gentleman should seek to pose what I thought would be a very important question and should, at the same time—quite properly, in my view, because his speech will be recorded in HANSARD and the nation will be entitled to read it—say that the Selby coal find was of equal
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
significance to a minor North Sea oil find. I think that was something like the words the hon. Gentleman used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much more than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek to endorse what the right hon. Gentleman said. I have visited the site and talked with the planners responsible on the site. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that, with all the modern techniques that the National Coal Board will be able to employ, there need be no fear about subsidence. National Coal Board will be able, with its modern mining techniques, to extract the coal. It will ultimately mean about 10 million tons for a period of about 25 years. There need be no fear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is discussion going on between the local authorities in the area and the planning engineers associated with the National Coal Board. They are trying to outline to them precisely how they propose to work the coal. Although the coal is about 8 ft. or 9 ft. high, lying about 900 feet, there is coking coal underneath, but the National Coal Board has said that it is content at this time to work only the 8 ft. and 9 ft. coal seams standing on the upper layer. I hope that the hon. Gentleman realises that, with the new modern techniques of drift mining, moving in pillars, and so on, there need be no anxiety for people in the surrounding area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authorities and the National Coal Board are looking at the whole question of the manpower that will be coming into the area. There are local anxieties in relation to subsidence, and I know that some of the people in rural areas are concerned that there may be an influx into the rural villages which, to some extent, might destroy the happy environment that they enjoy at present—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
