	<div class='title'>Hill Livestock (Compensatory Allowances) (Amendment) Regulations 1996</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Tyler 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Cornwall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Hill Livestock (Compensatory Allowances) (Amendment) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 27).</p></blockquote>
I welcome sitting under your chairmanship, Mr. Stewart, and hope that during the debate there will be a reflection of the extreme importance of the subject to hill farmers in Scotland. I know that their concerns are close to your heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the view of many Members—from all parties and from all parts of the country—hill farming support is the virility test of the sincerity of Ministers in their White Papers. There have been White Papers for Scotland and for England and I understand that the White Paper for Wales is to be published today or tomorrow. I expect to see in them a reflection of the importance that is attached to this type of support for this type of farming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some members of the Committee might not be entirely conversant with the economic problems of hill farming, so I shall sketch their importance. The less favoured areas cover 53 per cent. of the agricultural area of the United Kingdom and contain almost 70 per cent. of its beef cows and more than 60 per cent. of its sheep flock. This is not a minority or insignificant fringe issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the LFAs, agriculture provides vital social, environmental and economic elements. Farming generates employment, both with the purchase of inputs and the employment of labour. Farmers are essential to the local economy in a way that, perhaps, they are not in lowland and other areas. The environment that they create is crucial in attracting visitors—it is vital to the tourism industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incomes for the sector recovered between 1991 and 1993, but fell sharply in 1994. In 1992 and 1993, the Government used the partial recovery in farm incomes generally as a justification for cutting support for hill livestock farmers. The real value of hill livestock compensatory allowances, which the Government pay on beef cows and breeding sheep, was reduced. When farm incomes fell in 1994, there was no commensurate increase in HLCAs to compensate. It is a classic case of "heads we win, tails you lose".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall support for hill and upland farmers was reduced by between 6 per cent. and 9 per cent. on the 1993 level. In 1993–94, more than 40 per cent. of the full-time hill and upland farmers in England had an annual farm income of fewer than £10,000. In Scotland, as you, Mr. Stewart, will know, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
equivalent figure was almost 30 per cent. and in Wales more than 44 per cent. They are extraordinarily low figures for an extraordinarily large number of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1994, LFA farm incomes fell substantially, but the Government still froze the HCLAs to be paid in 1995. A small recovery in income is forecast for the current year, but LFA farm incomes are not expected to recover to 1992 or 1993 levels. In such circumstances, there is widespread support from the National Farmers Union of England and Wales, the National Farmers Union of Scotland and the Hill Farming Initiative for a return to the 1992 level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this juncture, it is important to enter a particular plea for those hill farmers who have been badly hit in the past 12 months by a combination of late frosts in 1995; a shortage of fodder, which made it expensive; set-aside already reducing the amount of hay and silage available; animals being unable to lay on the same amount of fat as they would in a better spring or during the summer; and the drought, which has affected the profitability and development of stock. If there is a long, cold spring in 1996 in those areas—some have recently been badly affected by the weather—those problems will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, Ministers have rightly been stating in their White Papers that they want to decouple support systems. They want to encourage environmentally friendly livestock management in a way that assists vulnerable areas with fragile economies, which desperately need a support system that encourages wider environmental, employment and social objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
HCLAs have been precisely targeted, cost-effective and universally popular. They have been an effective form of investment in the landscape of the uplands. Yet they are withering away before our eyes because Ministers have not had sufficient guts to stand up to the Treasury axe. I was struck by the comments made a few days ago by the retiring president of the National Farmers Union for Scotland, John Ross. He said that the major disappointment of his presidency was that, during that period, the real level of HLCAs had dropped. His dismay is echoed by farming leaders throughout England and Wales. Those Members who have met the Hill Farming Initiative will know how important HLCAs are to the economies of all upland areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since our debates in the autumn, the Minister has backtracked in two important respects. First, despite his eloquent attempt to persuade us that the number of eligible ewes in disadvantaged areas had to be reduced, he subsequently backtracked. I pay credit to him for listening to the representations made by people throughout the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Rural Affairs (Mr. Tim Boswell)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be fair to put on the record that any backtracking reflected the fact that I had indicated to the Committee that rates were being reduced as a precaution and to preserve the position for our consideration. We then considered the matter and came to the conclusion that the hon. Gentleman is about to acknowledge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that, but the Minister's argument in support of that reduction was eloquent. I have in a letter a far fuller version than that which he expressed in Committee. I do not wish to embarrass the Minister by paying credit to his extremely well-argued case for the change, but his eloquence gives the assurance that he has just suggested a slight tinge of déjà vue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had that change been pushed through, there would have been a potential loss of £7.32 per hectare for those farmers concerned. That would have given the lie to the assurance that the Minister gave us at the time that HLCAs were not being cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue that arose in that Committee was where we came in the league table in Europe. I do not have up-to-date figures because the Ministry has been unable to provide them, so I am not aware of our position in relation to the three new admissions to the European Union. In 1994, we paid the second lowest level of HCLA in Europe—47 ecu per livestock unit. That is very low, and many of our competitors give far greater support in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In real terms, farm incomes in less favoured areas have not returned to the levels of 1992–93, let alone those of the 1988–90 period. Since the HLCA values were considered appropriate in 1992, it is hard to find anybody who will produce a logical explanation for allowing the subsequent cuts to stand. Nobody outside the Ministry accepts that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the longer term, there will have to be improvements and an adjustment. The mechanism is by no means perfect. The wildlife trusts and farming unions would like to move HLCAs further away from coupling and to give them an area basis, taking into account real farm incomes. By contrast, it is now generally accepted that the moorland scheme has proved an abject failure. The take-up has been pathetic and even the latest announced changes are unlikely to make a dramatic change. I hope that the Minister will be able to show that he attaches a long-term future to the HLCAs. The time has come to seek to breathe new life into HLCAs so that we can have a new life in the hills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In every part of the United Kingdom, this debate is being seen as a test case for the sincerity of the rural White Paper. Will the Government change their attitude in taking away support from the less efficient forms of investment and bringing it back to a form of investment that is widely recognised to have huge environmental, social and employment advantages? I hope that the Minister will be more encouraging than he has been on previous occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Bermingham (St. Helens, South)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Stewart. I hope that you will pardon my ignorance if I get this wrong. The order was made on 9 January this year, laid before Parliament on 11 January and came into force on 1 February. According to my watch, today is 12 March. Will anything that we say today be worth while, if the order is already in force whether we agree it or not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that the praying time has elapsed, but, as I think the hon. Gentleman is aware, there is a motion in the name of the Leader of the Opposition, which means that the order before us could be considered on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Stewart. Can it be effective?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The House of Commons could pass a motion to revoke the order. The motion in front of the Committee is that it has considered the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Stewart. I am sorry to be pedantic, but this seems to be an abuse of process. The matter is prayed against, it is not discussed and is then considered when it is too late. That being the case, it does not matter what happens in this Committee because the Government will use their majority—that is, if they still have one; we can pray as each day passes that it will disappear. Perhaps Conservative Members with farming interests will come to their senses and realise the damage that is being done to the farming industry. However, this seems the wrong way to do things. if people object to an order, they should debate it before it comes into effect, otherwise it is an abuse of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest to the hon. Member that the proceedings in front of the Committee are entirely in order. But if he wants to raise these matters with the usual channels, that is a matter for him. If he wishes to catch my eye later in the debate, that is also a matter for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.42 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Llin Golding 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle-under-Lyme)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to see you in the Chair, Mr. Stewart, as I go through my learning curve on Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food issues. Some of the points that we are debating seem a little peculiar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the Government and hill farmers have had a dreadful year. While the Government have been buffeted by their own Euro-sceptics and the electorate, the hill farmers have suffered from drought, extreme heat, winter blizzards and from the Government themselves. From our previous debate on these matters, I learnt a great deal about the sense of grievance felt by hill farmers about the Government's treatment of the hill livestock allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Farmers Union has once again set down the hill farmers' case. In less favoured areas, farm incomes plummeted in 1989 and 1990 to reach an all-time low. When they recovered between 1992 and 1993, the Government cut the hill livestock compensatory allowances. They did not, however, restore them when hill farm incomes fell in 1994, but pegged them instead. The overall support to hill and upland farmers was reduced by between 6 per cent. and 9 per cent. below 1993 levels. Although a small recovery in income levels is forecast in less favoured area farm incomes, they are not expected to recover to 1993 levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0355">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
I know that under this Government, many people are worse off then they were in 1993, but by what reasoning have the Government decided to extend this misery to hill farmers? Do they reject the case made by the NFU and other organisations that hill farmers have low incomes? The Government should tell us if they consider that hill farmers' incomes are high enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the NFU, in 1993–94, more than 40 per cent. of full-time hill and upland farmers had an annual farm income of less than £10,000. In Scotland, the equivalent figure was almost 30 per cent., and in Wales more than 44 per cent. of full-time farmers had incomes of less than £10,000. Do the Government agree with those figures and, if so, what conclusions do they draw from them? Do they see it as a problem that the incomes of those who farm in less favoured areas vary widely?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Government's perception of the social nature of the payments? The NFU points out that in the less favoured areas, agriculture is of vital social, environmental and economic importance. Farming generates employment in relation to the purchase of inputs and the employment of labour. Farmers are essential for maintaining the environment in the hills and uplands which because of tourism, is also vital to local economies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the Government satisfied that the present levels of payment will prevent the decline of agriculture in the less favoured areas? Are their policies based on substituting craft shops for sheep and heritage centres for cattle? Although I enjoy craft shops and heritage centres, they should not be seen as substitutes for farming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am looking forward to my next salmon-fishing trip to Builth Wells. I had hoped to see a statue erected to the Minister there, following our previous debate, but unfortunately that is not to be. Had it been erected, however, it is quite possible that many of my countrymen would have come down from the hills and knocked it down. Nevertheless, perhaps such a statute will be erected to the Minister in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our debate in October, the Minister indicated that increases in the cost of feeding stuffs would be offset by other additional subsidies. Does he believe that that has happened? I am told that the average price of hay has increased from £68.34 a tonne in January 1995 to £98.36 a tonne this January. So although the suckler cow subsidy has increased by 24 per cent., the price of hay—which they eat by the lorry load—has increased by more than 40 per cent. Is my information correct?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In October, my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams) drew attention to the Consumers Association's devastating report on the common agriculture policy, which concluded that instead of receiving production-based support, farmers should receive direct payment on social, regional or environmental grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party wants to see a system that will protect those less well off farmers in the less favoured areas. That is why I ask my hon. Friends not to vote
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
against the order. Our objective must be to protect our heritage in the countryside. The question for the Government today is whether their attitude to the allowances is making that more difficult to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.47 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind that 53 per cent. of the land in the United Kingdom that contains 60 per cent. of cows and 70 per cent. of sheep is in less favoured areas, I declare an interest. Contrary to popular belief, 90 per cent. of the land in my constituency of St. Helens is agricultural and 10 per cent. is populated. In terms of population figures, it is the other way about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have much horticultural and agricultural land. I cannot claim that we have highland or hill farming interests, but I have only to look across the Mersey, beyond the Wirral and north Wales, to see interests that are affected by the regulations. That is why I am probably a stranger to your eyes in this context, Mr. Stewart, although I do turn up to these debates. My pedigree goes back to the Committee that considered what is now the Agricultural (Amendment) Act 1984. Indeed, the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) and I once proposed the idea of changing farm tenancy agreements. My party did not agree with me then, and it certainly did not agree with me when the Government went the way that I thought they should have gone 10 years before. Be that as it may, I have some pedigree in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I declare that interest at the beginning, because I am worried about what will happen if hill and upland farmers are driven out of business. What will be done with the land? The land will become derelict. In parts of Wales trees are planted on such land and in parts of England, particularly the midlands, new forests will be developed, but that does not create pleasant scenery for the long-term or attract and aid the tourism industry. One has to be practical in such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have effectively reduced farmers' incomes. That is like the Lord Chancellor and the law profession—he never pays it. Most of us do not get paid, and we have become used to that. The farming industry has the same problem—farmers do not get paid promptly, nor do people whose land is taken over for compensation, as the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) might agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is declining investment in agricultural and horticultural land. We must come to terms with the reality of farming and what I often call the on-cost advantage: when a scenic view with sheep and cows is created and the land is enhanced by promoting their development, the tourism industry is added to. The United Kingdom no longer manufactures very much because for some years we have had a Government who believe not in manufacturing industry but in chasing paper tigers across the world. We saw what happened with Barings. There are other examples, but I leave them aside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many parts of the country there is a need to develop a tourism industry, and the only way to enhance it is to improve the quality of life for the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0356">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
people and the quality of the land and the landscape. Under current agricultural policy, that, regrettably, can be done only by subsidising farmers. We do not subsidise properly, however, and real farm incomes in the uplands have steadly declined over the past five or six years. That is not an encouragement; it leads to poverty, bankruptcy, people leaving the land, vast areas of dereliction and an eventual reduction in the quality of life, of scenery and of the tourism industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes, it pays to invest, and there is a benefit, perhaps five years down the line, from an investment programme. Unfortunately, the Government have failed to recognise that and the proposals before the Committee are a further failure. I concede immediately, however, that they will not directly affect the agricultural or, in particular, the horticultural land in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will, however, be a serious effect on the lands between Yorkshire and Lancashire—for example, in the Pennines. There all also be a serious effect on north Wales. Those areas all affect my constituency. I attend the Committee's proceedings with those thoughts in mind and, perhaps, as a disturbing influence—I usually am; it is my policy—to bring home the truth to those who represent areas which they consider to be wholly agricultural. They forget that many Opposition Members have large tracts of agricultural land in their constituencies and considerable interest in the farming industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Conservative Members, who are dealing with their post and reading magazines, might listen to what I hope is the voice of reason and vote accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must declare an interest. In my constituency many farmers are dependent on hill livestock compensatory allowances. We depend on them to have the sort of countryside that we want to look at and tourists want to enjoy. As my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) eloquently said, if farmers are not farming in severely disadvantaged areas—they are now doing so at a marginal level—the land will become unpleasant, which is not what tourists want to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of those who have spent their lives putting everything into farming will not be able to continue. Farmers in many areas are on the edge of subsistence. My hon. Friend the member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mrs. Golding) said earlier that over 44 per cent. of full-time farmers in Wales have incomes of less than £10,000. Some of them earn much less than that and I do not know how they are able to continue. If the Government continue to cut HLCAs, those farmers will not be able to continue and the nation will be the less for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be fair, the Government supported HLCAs year after year until 1992. Then they had a brilliant idea to save themselves some money. They cut back in 1992 because there was a brief rise in farm incomes. Since then, there has been another rise in farm incomes because the other main source of income for farmers,
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
apart from their livestock price and the money that they get from what they produce, is the ewe premium that they receive directly from the European Union. That premium has been increasing because, thanks to the Government's incompetence in trying to stay in the exchange rate mechanism, the pound devalued and the green pound increased in value. Farmers have done rather better lately because of the Government's mishandling of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So what do the Government do? They freeze and then reduce HLCAs because that is within their control. The premium that they get from Europe also gives them the opportunity to replace money in the Exchequer from the British taxpayer with money from Europe. That sounds like a good idea if one is looking to have an election shortly and wants to fund tax cuts beforehand. It is not a good idea, however, for hill farmers and farmers in disadvantaged areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The HLCA regulations are already in play. The Government will not turn round and restore HLCAs to their 1992 value. I should like to see the Minister nod as a sign that he will do that, but I doubt that he will. Hill farmers in my area and elsewhere are paying for the Government's economic incompetence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.57 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to debate this important matter under your Chairmanship, Mr. Stewart. You and other members of the Committee bring a Scottish presence, even if there has not been a direct Scottish contribution to the debate so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always a pleasure to have the opportunity to debate hill livestock compensatory allowances. The hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) is assiduous in bringing the issue to the attention of the House of Commons, and other hon. Members have made interesting contributions. It is always a pleasure to listen to those who are not often present for debates on agriculture—including the hon. Member for St. Helens, South—but who make useful and interesting contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee from all parties are—allowing for the inevitable political differences—united in their recognition of the significance of hill farmers and the importance of maintaining their position and that of the communities in which they live. They contribute to tourism and the rural environment, for which I also have ministerial responsibility. As the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme was kind enough to mention obliquely, I have certain associations with the Principality. I used to buy my sheep there and I am well aware of the difficulties that many hill farmers have. They are to be commended on the quality of their livestock, which does so well in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can reply best to the debate by confining my remarks principally to the regulations that are before the Committee, but I shall make a couple of general points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I am tempted to refer to the series of points made by the hon. Member for North Cornwall about the implementation date. As to the procedures for the consideration of the regulations, I do not feel qualified
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
to speak at length, I merely say that in October we debated, with one exception, the substance of the proposals. We have had one bite of the cherry. The hon. Member for North Cornwall suggested that it was beneficial to have a bite in anticipation of a review rather than subsequently. He now has had two bites of the cherry, and I hope that he is grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the fact that we have implemented the regulations has enabled us to start making payments. They are under way and are much appreciated by the hill farmers who are receiving them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minster confirm that the only reason that the Committee did not discuss the regulations earlier was that a minor defect was found in the original drafting, otherwise we would have had the debate before it became necessary to implement the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may well be the case, but it would be by no means unprecedented. We are here for a debate on HLCAs, and it is right that the Committee should attend to the important matters that are associated with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make one more general observation before I come to the regulations. A number of points have been floated in Committee—I can put it no more precisely than that—as to the future structure of support. The hon. Member for St. Helens, South, coming fresh to this subject, suggested that he might want to be radical, as he has on other matters. Other hon. Members have suggested that they might like to look for changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that representative organisations such as the County Landowners Association and the National Farmers Union have proposed various structural changes. Such suggestions do not inhere in the regulations, but our minds are not closed to anything. We are always prepared to consider suggestions, although they may pose difficulties, including an almost certain requirement of reapplication to Europe for the introduction of any structural changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our duty—I take issue with the Opposition Members who have spoken—to produce the best deal for hill farming within the structure of the existing system. Hill farming makes an important contribution to the agriculture industry, as well as tourism. It is important to the beef industry, but forms the backbone of the sheepmeat industry. At the same time, it plays a significant and essential part in the preservation of some of the most environmentally valuable and beautiful regions of the United Kingdom, so it is right that we should give it attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations fix the substantive rates of allowances for the 1996 scheme. Without the regulations, the rates would be fixed by default at the European Community minimum. Having the regulations in place has enabled us to ensure that, at this moment, payable orders are being sent out in England. They have been calculated on the basis of the rates fixed in the regulations. As we well know, hill farmers set great store by the arrival of their HLCA payment, particularly at this time of year when winter
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
feed bills are coming in. Following the summer drought and the more recent severe weather conditions, we are more than usually aware of the need to make HLCA payments promptly. In England, we are aiming to complete payments under the 1996 HLCA scheme by the end of April, which is our charter. Perhaps I can go further and say that we hope to make payments in all but problem cases by the end of March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer briefly to previous discussions on the 1996 rates. The Hill Livestock (Compensatory Allowances) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1995 were debated in Committee on 25 October last year. Although they did not fix the rates for the 1996 scheme—they were introduced before the review—the hon. Member for North Cornwall and others took full advantage of the opportunity to express their views about the rates that should be set for 1996. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's points have already been noted and taken on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that time, the results of the 1995 autumn review of economic conditions in the hills and uplands were not available, and my contribution was, perforce, restricted to the results of the 1994 review. However, comments in the debate on 25 October were taken into account when we considered the 1996 scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The results of the 1995 autumn review, which considered rates of payment for the 1996 scheme, were published on 28 November 1995, when most of the rates were announced. At that time, the rate of payment on ewes in a disadvantaged area, together with the payment limit—which is fixed in terms of eligible ewes per hectare—had not been announced. The reason for the delay in announcing the rate was the proximity of the 1995 rate to the EC minimum, which—was not known until 1 January 1996. The hon. Member for North Cornwall secured an Adjournment debate on farm incomes in less favoured areas on 11 December. Therefore, those matters have been thoroughly discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my contribution to the Adjournment debate, I tried to summarise the results of the 1995 autumn review, which had been published by then. Full details of the statistical material are available in the Library. Therefore, I hope that I can confine myself to describing and discussing developments since 11 December, rather than rehashing the same topics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall deal with the legislative changes. if we use the exchange rate that was fixed on 1 January, the EC minimum payment on sheep is equivalent to £2.61 a ewe. The rate for ewes in disadvantaged areas is included in the regulations that we are debating. It was announced on 11 January as £2.65 a ewe to ensure that we continue to comply with EC regulations. We pay almost 2 per cent. above the rate set down in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also announced our intention to fix the payment limit for sheep in disadvantaged areas at nine ewes per hectare. That is the same as the level that was fixed under the 1995 scheme. The decision, to which the hon. Member for North Cornwall referred, to maintain the limit at 1995 levels took account of many representations from the National Farmers Union and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
other farming interests on the subject, and especially the criticism that the consultation on the proposal to change the limit was inadequate. Producers will clearly welcome the decision. But as a result of it, the maximum payment per hectare on sheep in disadvantaged areas remains higher than the equivalent maximum payment in severely disadvantaged areas. To pick on a small point that the hon. Member for North Cornwall made, not everyone stocks up to the limit. We are considering the maximum in Committee. Although I cannot anticipate a subsequent review, we expect to return to the question of how best to redress the imbalance in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I shall refer to the latest farm income figures. On 31 January, the Department announced provisional estimates of the total income from farming in 1995. It shows that, in real terms, the industry's income increased by 22 per cent. I am sure that the Committee believes that that is good news. However, not all sectors of the industry benefited equally—they have never done so. The press notice also contained figures that showed the latest estimate of changes in the net farm income for different sorts of farm. The greatest increases are in cereal and general cropping farms. Although increases are expected for most other types of farm, they are more modest and follow a decline in incomes in the previous year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These estimates take account of data that have become available since October 1995 when the autumn review figures were finalised, notably the rates for HLCA and sheep annual premium, livestock market prices and more up-to-date information on fodder prices and availability following the ending of the drought in the summer of 1995. In addition, the opportunity has been taken to revise the series to reflect the latest farm classification and to ensure that subsidies have been treated consistently across all countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should bear in mind the fact that there was a terrible drought in 1995, which affected upland fanning, certainly in the Pennines and North Wales. We have had a lousy winter in 1995–96 and many sheep have had to come down from the hills. The bad weather has also created problems with cattle and led to the escalation in the price of hay and other fodder, further decreasing the effective income of hill farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a farmer myself, I am well aware of the consequences of a hard winter. We can measure those effects in the 1996 autumn review, when the whole year will be taken into account. It has never been, nor could it be, the practice to anticipate what will happen in exceptional circumstances in the course of a year. We consider what has happened to farming incomes as a result of the weather, market prices, subsidies and so on, and reach a conclusion in setting new rates for the scheme year by year. I remind the hon. Gentleman that, as I said on the previous occasion when we debated the issue, the purpose of
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
HCLAs is to remove or to compensate for permanent disadvantage; they are not designed to hop about and follow the conditions in any one year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We already know which water authorities will have drought problems again next summer. I concede that policy cannot be based on hopping from contingency to contingency, but, given the protracted series of events over the past four or five years, some prediction of the effect on the farming industry must be possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is an impeccable advocate for his point, and data on water supplies are available. My constituency covers three major water catchments, and I had a briefing recently from Severn Trent Water. Although it had a substantial shortfall at the beginning of February, that was tackled remarkably quickly during that month. There will be differences in water companies in different regions and it is better to consider what has happened at the end of a year, when one can coolly sit down with the farming unions and look at the overall results for the industry, rather than try to anticipate what will occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Golding</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the Severn Trent area, if the Minister had turned over the page, he would have seen that only part of that area had recovered; the rest still has a severe water shortage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not wish to give the impression that there were not still problems in that company or region. I am saying only that there was a remarkably quick change, which is what happens if one tries to compensate for a particular occurrence each time it happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to show the Committee that, obviously, there will be some volatility between years in farm income figures, especially in a certain sector and between different farm enterprises within years. The upshot of the new revised figures is that in real terms they show that the net farm income on average full-time cattle and sheep farms in the LFA—the kinds of farms that we are debating—fell by 27 per cent. between 1993–94 and 1994–95 and is expected to recover by 13 per cent. in 1995–96. As I understand it, there has been more of a dip and more of a rebound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the position over the two-year period between 1993–94 and 1995–96 is much as was anticipated in the annual autumn review. We therefore see no reason to reconsider the rates of payment for the 1996 scheme in the light of the new information. With regard to 1997, of course, the whole data series will be examined as part of the review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No precise figures are available for the total subsidies paid in the less-favoured areas. I believe that I must draw that point to the Committee's attention again. We estimate that the total of beef special premium, suckler cow premium, sheep annual premium and the hill livestock compensatory allowances paid to livestock farmers in the LFA amounted to about £550 million in 1993 and 1994, and £600 million in 1995. They are expected to rise to £650 million in 1996. Those substantial sums of money—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0359">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
much larger than HLCAs alone—demonstrate the Government's continuing commitment to the continuation of livestock farming in the LFAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Cornwall spoke about the comparative situation in other European Union member states, about which we have corresponded. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that I let him have some material in confidence, because it had not been considered by the EU committee. It has now been considered, and I am grateful to him for preserving that confidence. I may be able to make further information available to him on the analysis between the various member states—I shall consider whether I can do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting, in the light of today's discussions and the statement made on the Floor of the House, that the European regulations under which the HLCAs are payable allow considerable scope for the incorporation of national rules. It is, therefore, not quite straightforward to make comparisons between the regimes of different member states. A mere comparison of the average payment per livestock unit included in the scheme is not favourable to the United Kingdom. But that is a rather simplistic approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A more valid comparison between the member states is the average payment of compensatory allowance per holding. On that score, the United Kingdom's support was the second highest in the European Community—only Luxembourg paid more. Without further explanation, it would be easy to assume that the reason for the higher payment per holding in the United Kingdom is the result of the larger average holding size when compared with other member states. That is not, by itself, absurd, because it reflects the fact that our family farms are rather larger than those in many other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me cast a small fly across the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme and say that with regard to a socially driven European agricultural policy, not too many farmers in Britain qualify as small farmers within the European rules. However, that is for debate on another occasion. I am simply saying that even an analysis based on the size of holdings does not give the whole picture. Despite the higher rates of allowance paid in other member states, most have a fixed limit on payments, either in terms of a maximum sum of money or a restriction on the number of animals eligible for allowances. The United Kingdom has no such limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another important difference: most other member states have imposed limits on payments so that expenditure that is not reimbursed by the European Community is avoided by setting a ceiling on payments or by excluding pensioners from the scheme. In the United Kingdom, state aids are paid so that we do not need to restrict payments to the level that will be funded by the European Community. Given these comparisons between the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Community, I think that we are not as penny pinching as we are sometimes accused of being.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
In summary, the overall situation is not as black as one or two members of the Committee have sought to paint it. Net farm incomes of average cattle and sheep farmers in the less-favoured areas are forecast to recover in 1995–96. Total direct livestock subsidies in the less-favoured areas are expected to increase in 1996. In addition, the schemes operated in other member states are perhaps not as generous as they might at first sight appear to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all unite in the Committee in our concern for the situation and incomes of hill farmers, and I am pleased to debate these matters in the constructive way that we traditionally do. I am happy to have been able to maintain the rates under the 1996 HLCA scheme and not to cut them. In one case, indeed, they have been modestly increased above the 1995 levels. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.20 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond briefly. It is great to be back again; several of us appear regularly on these occasions, and I am grateful particularly for the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie), who has many hill farmers in her constituency, and of the hon. Member for Clwyd, South-West (Mr. Jones), who has also been here before and shares my considerable interest and concern for what is happening in the hills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was grateful the the Minister for seeking to cover a wide horizon in his opening remarks. There is concern across all parties to get the right structure of hill support, and I was glad to hear him say that minds are not closed. I took his final remarks about variations within the European Union to be encouraging as it seems important that we design our hill support system in the United Kingdom to suit the different parts of this country. We should not be forced into a uniform system that might apply to parts of Germany or Spain but not us. That does not deny the need for suitable variations to suit our own requirements. The HLCA model appears much better, in terms of popularity and take up, than, say, the moorland scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also interested to hear the Minister say that although he had retreated on the subject of eligible ewes in the disadvantaged areas—DAs—he would have to return to differentials between DAs and SDAs. We understand that, but many of us feel that the right approach is not to reduce the effect on farm incomes of DA farmers but to increase the impact on the farm incomes of those in SDAs. That would best maintain differentials and redress the balance in a helpful way for the farming of the outlands and for the environment, to which we all attach so much importance. It would help, too, to make sure that people are still there to farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to indices for farm incomes, and I have the table that his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State published on 1 February. It is worth examining the indices across the past decade or so in order to respond to the Minister's comments about volatility. Certainly, the figures are volatile from year to year. We accept that it is important that HLCAs should not jump about accordingly, but that seems to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
be what started to happen in 1992. One good year appeared to spark a reduction in HLCA that is entirely unjustified and does not follow the Minister's reasonable logic this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In real terms, the figure for net farm income for cattle and sheep in LFAs was 150 in 1987–88, according to the Ministry's figures. It increased to 172 in 1988-89, but dropped to 115 in 1989–90. It went right down to 85 in 1991, then recovered a little to 101 in 1991–92. It was on that basis that HLCAs suddenly started being cut—a curious decision. In 1992–93, the figure went up to 129, and it went up again in 1993–94 to 147. There was then a sharp drop—as the Minister acknowledged—to 108. It was levelled off, according to the provisional figure, at 120 in 1995–96. That is less than it was in real terms in 1992–93 when the cuts began.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept the Minister's logical argument that excessive volatility is to be avoided and that the allowance is intended as longer-term compensation for
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
longer-term disadvantages. That gave no excuse to the Minister's predecessors to start making cuts in 1992. Rather, it gives full support to the argument of Liberal Democrats, and of colleagues in other parties, that it is time to redress the balance and move back to the 1992 level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discussion has been useful. I hope that it has helped the Minister—if only because the objective of us all is to arm him for the battle ahead; which will begin in comparatively few months, when once again he will confront the Treasury to try to achieve a more logical outcome than he did last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
