	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee rose on Tuesday, I was in the process of calling attention to the level of air fares and relating that to the effect on the revenues of British Airways. I was trying to elicit a reaction from my hon. Friend the Minister to some of the points that I had made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had just pointed out that the Government had understandable pride in low transatlantic fares, but I expressed a fear that unless large fare increases came along soon we could face the failure of an airline. I do not imply that that airline would be British Airways, but they could not escape and have not been able to escape from the consequences of the dilution of revenue that has been the result of the lowering of fares across the Atlantic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had turned to Europe, and I had conceded that there was scope for reduction in European air fares. Massive across-the-board reductions not only are not desirable if the service that passengers have come to expect is to be maintained, but it is not possible unless the airlines' finances are to be strained almost to breaking point. Nor is it any good to engage in glib talk about the breaking cartels as though
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
the achievement of that desirable objective meant that air fares would come tumbling down without economic consequences for the airlines. It is instructive that the greatest resistance to an across-the-board reduction in European air fares comes not from IATA but from Lufthansa, which the Committee will not have failed to notice is about the most profitable airline in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder sometimes whether the movement to reduce air fares in Europe during the past 18 months is entirely appreciated. The fares are often compared unfavourably with air fares in the United States, forgetting altogether the entirely different circumstances of lower aviation fuel cost and lower charges. One can consider two comparable routes, such as Amsterdam to London and San Francisco to Santa Barbara. In July 1980, the ratio of the European fare to the American fare was 2·9, whereas in September 1981 that had come down to 1·5. So without the breaking of the cartel to which some people continue to turn their attention, considerable movement was achieved in that case. If the Committee believes that that is an isolated example perhaps I could give a more pointed one by contrasting the fares from Stockholm to London and Los Angeles to Seattle. In July 1980 the ratio was 4·6, and in September 1981 it had come down to 1·5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that we should look for some reductions in European air fares. We should expect some further innovation by the British airlines, but massive dilution of revenue would be unhelpful to British Airways and ultimately not in the best interests of the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to quote from a respected travel writer, Mr. Roger Bray, who writes for the London 
	<i>Standard. </i> He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>" But people cannot travel at prices which do not allow the maintenance of a viable industry unless somebody somewhere, subsidises them."</p></blockquote>
I assume that the Minister will confirm this morning that whoever may be prepared to subsidise the airlines, it will not be the Government. Therefore, I hope that he will take on board my points about the role that the Government must play in resisting the undue dilution of British Airways revenue. It is all a matter of the profitability of our national airlines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to relate those remarks to privatisation and to suggest that the profitability of British Airways is crucial if the Government's policy of privatisation is to proceed. I start by reminding the Minister that I am in favour of the privatisation of British Airways. I have asked some questions about it in the past, but I am in agreement with the policy. I wish to see it carried out successfully. There is no clash on a basic point of principle, but I found myself in some slight disagreement with my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson). We face a real dilemma because there is an economic timing and a political timing for the sale of British Airways. My hon. Friend is prepared to press ahead with all conceivable speed because,, among other reasons, he feels that it is essential
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0116">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
to privatise British Airways so that the airline will be encouraged to revamp their management and inject a more entrepreneurial approach into their affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not persuaded that British Airways are necessarily waiting for privatisation before showing considerable signs of marketing expertise and an upgrading of their management, which I have always considered to be among the better management of nationalised corporations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some real questions about the date of privatisation for my hon. Friend the Minister. Can he tell us today on which date the Government wish to offer the shares to the public? Secondly, am I correct to assume that included in the list of considerations is whether, by that time, there will be a track record of profitability by British Airways?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to put the matter to the Minister as gently as I can. If the timing is wrong, is it possible that not only shall we be left with some of the stock on our hands, but we shall be left with political egg on our joint faces because it will be seen that a bold experiment has not come off? In all those circumstances, I hope that my hon. Friend will take the point that we must offer to the public a going concern with a growing track record of profitability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest several ways in which the Government, without direct interference, can be of assistance in returning the airline to that track of profitability. The charges to which we referred during an earlier sitting of the Committee could be lightened if there were a modest change in Government policy. There could be a realism about air fares. Finally, there should be a recognition by the Minister that competition from independent airlines is a policy to which both he and I subscribe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I suspect that he, like me, will concede that at the moment the pursuit of the introduction of massive independent competition to British Airways may once again be seen as reducing the viability and profitability of British Airways as an airline, the assets of which we wish to dispose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the two sides of the Government's policy on the matter might be seen to be in conflict. Either we build up British Airways ready for the sale that surely is pre-eminent in Government policy, or we encourage maximum competition from the independent airlines. The Minister must turn his attention again to whether we can continue with both sides simultaneously in the way that we have been trying to do since the passage of the Civil Aviation Act 1980.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Atkins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preston, North) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely interested in my hon. Friend's remarks about air fares generally. Can he give the Committee any idea of the position of London to Hong Kong traffic, where three major British associated carriers are involved, with possibly a fourth under licence? Does he know whether any of those companies is making any money, and does he draw any conclusion from .the fact that if they are not it is not in the interest
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
of the consumer that they should be fighting it out, to the long-term detriment of all concerned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's words are music to my ears because I suspect that I was the only Conservative Member who, when the announce ment was made by the former Secretary of State for trade, had the temerity—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend joined me, I must have been so overwhelmed with emotion that I did not notice. I concede that on the Hong Kong route, we have just the example to which I am trying to draw the Committee's attention. Of course, it is of great advantage to the tourist that he or she can now travel to Hong Kong at a lower rate than hitherto. But there is very little profit to the airline having a full payload at the rear of the aircraft unless it can attract the business traveller at the front. None of those three airlines on the London-Hong Kong route has been able to do that effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many ways, my hon. Friend underlines my point. Competition is grand, but we must be realistic about it. I am not calling for an end to competition. I simply ask the Government to recognise that in pursuing one side of their aviation policy—the encouragement of independents competing with British Airways—they are running a risk that they will dilute the revenue of British Airways, the sale of which is the other and arguably more important aspect of their policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to a more homely aspect as I look across at the serried ranks of Scottish Labour MPs and remember my origin and, of course, that of my hon. Friend, the Minister—in no way would I wish to exclude him because I am confident of extensive replies to all my points. I draw the attention of the Committee to the recent position of the London-Glasgow and London-Edinburgh routes. I recognise that my hon. Friend will not be able to respond because there is currently an appeal to the Secretary of State for Trade about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Midland Airways an efficient independent airline for which I have the highest regard applied to fly on the route in competition not only with British Airways from Heathrow, but arguably, in competition with British Caledonian from Gatwick. In its wisdom, the CAA recognised that this was not the time to introduce yet more competition. The result could conceivably have been the end of the shuttle, and it would certainly have resulted in the dilution of revenue to British Airways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to promise cut fares, as British Midland did then. Whether it is as easy to sustain them once the airline is on the route is a wider question. If that is a straw in the wind, without asking the Minister to reply specifically I hope that he will be able to say that he recognises that there is at present real need to build up British Airways without prejudice to the overall policy of competition between the independents and the national airline. I hope that he will be able to say that in those ways the economic and political timing of privatisation coincides and that when British Airways have been privatised
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
there will be conditions for a competitive service that arguably do not exist now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a question for both British Airways and the Government. I have been talking about the dilution of revenue of British Airways, and I come now the vexed question of discounting. We have all become aware of what is called the bucket shop syndrome—the tendency of airlines, unable to attract custom at full fares, being prepared to dump large numbers of tickets on to the market at discount prices, again to the advantage of the consumer. Who would begrudge the opportunity of people to travel at a lower price than would otherwise be available? Again, not only the revenues of British Airways but the revenues of most international airlines have been diluted as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, British Airways have been critical of the bucket shops' development, although one has not always been totally persuaded that they have not been dumping more than a few tickets on to the market. Be that as it may, they have now decided that they will enter the discounting game openly and sell discounted tickets through all official travel agency outlets. I endorse that, but I am a little concerned that this is a further example of the dilution of revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Government's policy on discounting? There is little doubt in my mind that the announcement by British Airways is an indication that they are breaking the rules, but they and other airlines have been breaking the rules for years. I was instrumental in forcing the setting up of a working party on the subject in 1977, under the chairmanship of the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis), which got us nowhere. The discussion has been continuing for a long time. Would it not be honest for the Government now to say that discounting is a permanent feature of the aviation scene and that as a result we should stop all the hypocrisy of saying that airlines should not sell their wares at a discounted price if, in their commercial judgment, that is what they wanted to do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is irreconcilable that we should have a statement from the IATA airlines at Cannes a few weeks ago grandly announcing a new joint effort to remove discount tickets from the market, followed three weeks later by a British Airways announcement that they will flood the market with discounted tickets. That is some evidence of the present state of psychology of the aviation industry. The Government have a responsibility to say that of course they wish the public to continue to enjoy discounted tickets, as far as they can be made available commercially by the airline, and that there will be no question in future of any prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My wish is to bolster British Airways without detriment to the independent airlines. I suggest to my hon. Friend the Minister that the Government's role is to maximise the revenue of British Airways by encouraging them to continue the imaginative marketing that they have shown a flair for in the recent past, but that the Government should give positive assistance with fare policy and charging. I hope that the Minister will recognise that these
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
are pertinent points relative to the whole purpose of the Bill. For whatever reason, we all have an interest in a viable and profitable British Airways. I have suggested that some of the actions that have been taken by the Government, and some that are in prospect, could lead in an opposite direction. That would not be in the Minister's interest. I should not want it to happen, and it would not be the most successful way to lead to the privatisation of British Airways that both the Minister and I wish to see achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Lambie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Central Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Brentford and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) said, except his remarks about the privatisation of British Airways. I think that I can accept all his other arguments. It is good to hear those arguments from the Conservative side of the Committee. This shows that it is not merely a matter of direct opposition between the two sides, as sometimes appears in dealing with civil aviation. It shows that there is common ground on these matters. We should be looking not only to the future of British Airways but to that of some of the independent companies in competition with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments provide the opportunity to consider the finances of British Airways. We cannot do that without considering the increased airport charges proposed by the British Airports Authority. I hope that the Minister will give us a full report of his meeting yesterday with Mr. Norman Payne, chairman of the British Airports Authority, and Mr. Payne's answers to hon. Members' criticisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Members of the Committee, with some of our colleagues in the Scottish parliamentary Labour Group, had a very enjoyable meeting yesterday with Sir John King, chairman of British Airways, and Roy Watts, the chief executive. We put a number of questions to them and asked them to justify their statements to us and their criticism of the proposed increases in airport charges by the British Airports Authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I again draw attention to the letter from Mr. John Mulkern, managing director of the British Airports Authority, in which he said in criticism of British Airways that
	<br><blockquote><p>" the BAA is surprised that British Airways, an organisation that has recently reported a loss of £140 million and is currently making about 9,000 people redundant … should seek publicly to advise the BAA on how to operate an efficient business."</p></blockquote>
That was in reply to the statement in the British Airways " Guidelines" published on 4 December that
	<br><blockquote><p>" It is unacceptable that the BAA should be able to rely on its monopoly position to achieve its financial targets."</p></blockquote>
Here, one nationalised concern is openly criticising another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Minister that instead of meeting the chairmen, chief executives and managing directors separately it is time we brought them together. They could then fight it out in the same ring with the Minister present and we might reach some agreement about the validity of the various statements. I must
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
confess that at one stage in our meeting with Sir John King, from the attitude of some members of the Scottish group, I thought that we were in the ring, as they were attacking Sir John rather than the Government on certain points. We must achieve some agreement on the various matters of dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major point of dispute, again, is contained in the letter sent to us by John Mukern. He writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The BAA denies that the effect of such increases on British Airways at Heathrow and Gatwick would be to raise their overall landing charges by 17 per cent."</p></blockquote>
When we put this to Roy Watts yesterday, he said that British Airways must surely know from their projected programme for next year what the charges would be. They have the information, while the British Airports Authority does not. British Airways have fed that information into their computer, and the answer was an increase of 17 per cent. I accept British Airways' figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should British Airways be subjected to an increase of 17 per cent, when the Government are trying to impose a limit of 4 per cent, on wage settlements? If the Government are trying to bring down the level of inflation, why should the British Airports Authority be allowed to use its monopoly position to charge whatever it likes, regardless of its efficiency and whether the figures are satisfactory to the people using the airports?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Atkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without commenting on whether the charges are right or wrong, does not the hon. Gentleman accept that the British Airports Authority makes a loss on running Heathrow, even with the present charges, and manages to break even or to make a profit only as a result of the so-called duty-free or duty-reduced products? How does he expect the British Airports Authority to break even or to continue to be profitable without increasing its charges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may well be right. That is why I want an inquiry into the operation of the British Airports Authority. That is why I am disappointed that, despite the statement in the Twentieth Report of the Public Accounts Committee that the performance of the British Airports Authority would be monitored, especially by comparison with European and American airports, no progress has been made on that. I should accept the hon. Gentleman's figure if there were an independent inquiry into the operation of the British Airports Authority, but that has not taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Airports Authority is a national monopoly which can charge whatever prices it wishes, and it looks as though the Government will not interfere. British Airways must compete internationally with other airlines. They are under a greater discipline than the British Airports Authority as a result of international and indeed national competition. I accept the arguments and figures put to me and my hon. Friends by British Airways. From the evidence given to us yesterday, I accept that they will face an increase in charges of 17 per cent. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us Mr. Norman Payne's answers to those questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Steen 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Wavertree)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that British Airways have now discontinued their Executive Club card arrangement, which was offered as a facility to busy travellers on its routes in the same way as British Caledonian offers the excellent Chieftan Club service— 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) is not interested in these matters, but many people in British industry are. British Airways have stated that the executive card will still be offered to travellers who make more than £5,000 worth of flights per year, but that an additional charge of £55 per year will be made for use of the executive lounges. Why? Among other reasons, it is because of the increased charges by the British Airports Authority for landings at London airport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This will result in higher fares and in industry having to charge more for its products, and it will have a snowball effect. The British Airports Authority monopoly is making quite disproportionate increases in landing charges which will affect not only the national carrier, British Airways, but private airlines as well. There will be a knock-on effect. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that this should be discouraged and kept to a minimum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am an executive card holder myself, but I am afraid that I will not be paying the extra £55 to join the new scheme. To be fair to British Airways, the existing scheme was so successful—I think that there were more than 66,000 members using the executive card—that the facilities became overcrowded. The hon. Member will know that many of the executive lounges were so full that other passengers could not get in. British Airways have changed the system, and we shall have to wait to see the results. I doubt whether many Scottish people will join now that there is a charge of £55.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have had so many interventions that I am not quite sure where I am. However, I think I have made the point that we have to get the British Airports Authority and British Airways together, and the Minister is the only one who can achieve that. We must have direct Government intervention to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
stop the British Airports Authority increasing charges so much. If charges are to be increased, the increase should be in the region of 4 per cent, or 5 per cent., in line with the Government's wage norm, and not the sums mentioned by the British Airports Authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read that British Airways will continue to use the Concorde. That is the right decision. I ask the Minister to confirm that this decision has full Government approval and that the Government will justify British Airways' decision. I ask this because Federal Express, the American company, are considering extending its activities to Europe. If it does, it will use, as its main distribution point, either Prestwick airport or Shannon airport in Southern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that Federal Express has a preference for Prestwick and that the only hold up for the airline is that its plan is based on using the Concorde. It will not be prepared to spend millions of pounds building up that system only to find within a year or so that the Concorde is to disappear from the major routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to confirm that now that British Airways have given an assurance that they will continue to use the Concorde, as much Government support as possible will be given to the British Airports Authority to ensure that Federal Express uses Prestwick airport as its main distribution point for Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Prestwick airport is chosen by Federal Express, it will have a psychological impact on Prestwick. It will concentrate more planes and activities on the airport, making it more viable. It will also
	<div class='sup'>1</div> <!-- sup --> bring increased employment to an area with some of the highest rates of unemployment in the United Kingdom. It will give a boost to Prestwick and the West of Scotland. I am sure that the Minister, who represents a Scottish constituency, accepts that. I hope that the Minister will assure us that he will give full support to Federal Express to ensure its move to Prestwick.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by apologising to the Committee for my late arrival. I was advised that the Committee would dispose of the Bill in one morning, but it has now gone to three mornings. I had to make arrangements to go to the United States this weekend and that necessitated certain arrangements which I could only make this morning.

There is a big international romance with the concept of flying. Going over the Atlantic is always attractive for many people who enjoy leaving these shores and going abroad. The overseas routes, the liberation of the skies, the jetting to Hong Kong, all capture the imagination. Thanks to the former Secretary of State for Trade, the Hong Kong route has been freed from British Airways domination. The right hon. Gentleman overturned the Civil Aviation Authority's ruling and allowed British Caledonian to compete on the route. The route has become liberalised and privatised, and competition has made it a better one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The liberalising of the skies from State monopoly is the international philosophy which has resulted
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
in Laker flying to New York. Cathay Pacific can now produce a single fare to Hong Kong which is as cheap as the return fare to Glasgow, which shows how high the return fare to Glasgow must be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The London to Glasgow route is dominated by the State carrier in that flying from Heathrow to Glasgow is, as I understand it, solely the right of British Airways. We all want cheap fares. British Airways have been forced to join the cut and thrust, but one wonders how far they are using their public subsidies to undercut the private airlines' fares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pity that the hon. Gentleman was late, because he missed the speech of his hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) who said exactly the opposite—that competition on the Hong Kong route was disastrous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Liverpool Wavertree (Mr. Steen) seems to have been reading romantic novels in the time that he has been travelling to the Committee—he is putting forward a romance. Whereas British Airways are the only carrier flying out of Heathrow, Gatwick is one of the other London airports. There will always be different airports used to serve London. But they are serving the same centre. Therefore, as the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar pointed out, British Caledonian is competing with British Airways on the London to Glasgow route and the London to Edinburgh route, and they are both competing against British Rail. There is thus a great deal of competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am never quite sure what the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) is trying to say, but I always listen to him with particular interest. However, the Committee will not wish to go into a fourth morning, so I shall ignore some of his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot speak for my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle), because he speaks very well for himself. The Government have always encouraged private enterprise, and I am sure, once we see how the Hong Kong and Laker developments work out and once the recession ends, that my hon. Friend will eat his words and realise that the operation is a highly successful one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all want cheap fares and, no doubt to see them coming down. We must be concerned with the public subsidy which the State airline obviously command and that their public borrowing powers are not used to undercut the private operators. From what I am advised, there is no doubt that fare prices on the Dan-Air flight from London to Aberdeen are now so low that it is unviable for British Airways and Dan-Air. That has resulted in a uneconomic service, because the State airlines can use their considerable clout in underpinning their own fares, thereby undercutting the private carriers. Therefore, I ask the Minister to assure the Committee that that £200 million loan will be sanctioned exclusively to be used for the purchase of new aircraft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister assure us that no part of that money will be used to subsidise or cross-subsidise British Airways flight operations? Will he tell the Committee of his plans to ensure that the money is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
correctly spent for the purposes for which it is given?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While international flight has a tremendous romance, obviously the soul of the hon. Member for South Ayrshire has been hardened, because most operators who fly the big international flights realise that there is a certain romance in flying them. The hon. Gentleman has obviously not felt that romance, and I am sorry about that. It is clear that while international travel is a great liberation, domestic aviation, which is part of Britain's infrastructure, does not have much glamour. From what we have heard in the Committee about cattle trucks and so on, it has a most unattractive side to it compared with the attractive sides of international flying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is inconceivable that we should discontinue domestic flights and tell overseas passengers arriving at Heathrow or Gatwick that they must tour the country by bus or train. That is just not a feasible proposition. Therefore, the British Airports Authority has rightly ensured that passengers arriving at Heathrow and other airports have communicating flights to the principal cities in England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. Whereas London airport continues to prosper as the capital city's principal airport, the important provincial airports are struggling to survive. We have the big glamorous operations such as the Laker Skytrain, and British Caledonian flies tourists and offers them cheap tickets, but the domestic routes operators cannot offer the same cheap travel. It is hard work for the domestic routes to make profits, and bringing passengers from Newcastle, Cardiff and Liverpool is not a glamorous prospect of flying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we keep the corridors in Britain linked to the world. If the provincial domestic routes are to remain open and viable, it is not possible for British Airways to continue to dominate the main traffic routes, enjoying profits from them and receiving little competition. Whenever private operators challenge British Airways' monopoly in Britain, the CAA inevitably turns down the applications although, in recent years, the authority has made it plain that British Airways' timekeeping, reliability and fare structure are far from satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disagree fundamentally with my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Mr. Steen). However, everyone knows that British Airways have had problems about punctuality but, as I understand it, they have given that point their urgent attention. I was informed by a senior member of the British Airways management in August that the most recent figures showed, bar none, that they were the most punctual and up-to-date airline. To that extent, and allowing for the change, they should be given due credit for what they have put in, and the myth that they
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
are out of date, have bad timing and do not arrive at the right places ought to be destroyed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be unfortunate if I disagreed with my hon. Friend, because he has great experience in these matters. I wish that I and the CAA could agree with him. However, as recently as two months ago the CAA refused two applications by a private operator to fly the Heathrow to Edinburgh and Glasgow routes. As I recollect it, in its grounds for refusal the CAA admitted that British Airways' timekeeping on the shuttle, their reliability and fare structures needed improvement. As my hon. Friend said, British Airways provide a world service but I am now concentrating—he may not have appreciated this—on domestic services. I have flown throughout the world with British Airways and I agree with my hon. Friend that they provide an impeccable service. However, I have now gone off the glamour routes to discuss the domestic front.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon.

Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie) and I attended, that the facts given by the hon. Member for Preston, North are correct. On the Opposition side of the Committee, there are three regular users of the shuttle, and we can confirm from our own experiences that the timekeeping has greatly improved over the past year and is now extremely good. The hon. Member for Wavertree has a rather faulty recollection of the CAA's decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My recollection is not faulty, and we can argue about that; I can show the hon. Gentleman the relevant passages. The service has improved only because of the CCA's criticisms. It is a pity that the CAA has to make criticisms before British Airways improve the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The part of the argument which tends to get lost because of the rather lengthy interventions—I am concerned and hope that the Minister is about this —is that British Airways are not being subsidised by public funds or being allowed to borrow public money to underpin their flying operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative Party is opposed to providing public funds to bail out organisations which cannot make a go of things themselves, and we have said that often enough. We oppose subsidising inefficiency, particularly among the State monopolies. We want the forces of the market to operate and private enterprise to get a good share of the market. However, how can they do that if they cannot get a foot in on some of the domestic routes? I am now referring to the State monopoly on some of Britiain's trunk routes by British Airways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well hon. Members saying that London is Gatwick just as much as Heathrow is,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
but they know the volume of traffic that goes through Heathrow and Gatwick and they can readily work out the numbers of passengers that fly on the Glasgow and Edinburgh flights from Heathrow rather than on British Caledonian whose planes often leave with far less passengers than those of British Airways. That is because of the Heathrow monopoly. I will not be sidetracked on that, but it is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that British Airways are now providing lower internatiional fares, and it is recognised that they are doing that to keep up with more efficient competition. I am sure that there is no dispute on either side of the Commiittee that that is happening and, with their public borrowing powers, they are able to undercut and underpin fares simply because foreign competitors are able to run their services more efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, are the public paying for that, and should they pay for it? Should the public pay for British Aiirways to compete with private operators such as Cathay Pacific, which can run a more efficient service? I hope that the Minister will talk about the £200 million loan and make sure that it does not get used to continue that practicie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deal for a moment on why we have to give £200 million loan sanctiion to Britiish Airways and they are such a heavy loss maker. I understand that the loss this year is expected to be about £225 million. Can the Minister tell us whether the £200 million loan will merely cancel some of the losses for this year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can say that British Airways are a loss maker, but we do not know why they are a loss maker. We know that they fly many unprofitable routes and that they have a world-wide network, but do they not fly lucrative routes as well? I wonder whether the money that we are being asked to grant on their loan sanction will be used for redundancy payments in reducing the number of staff. If so, that is not what we have been told. We want to know whether the £200 million is to be spent on new aircraft or on redundancy payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Airways have been running out of money for about 10 years. Since the management seems to be unable or unwilling to do much about it, and since the Government continue to permit increased borrowing powers, the process goes on year after year. What other airline would keep 400 pilots at home on full pay? That is what I gather is now happening in British Airways. While British Airways have it so good, the private sector is going through a difficult time. Laker has problems, British Midland has difficulties, and Dan-Air is finding the going tough. The Dan-Air flight from Gatwick to Aberdeen has been badly undercut by British Airways. While welcoming competition, I do not welcome competition with Government money. I hope that the Minister will insist that private operators compete with British Airways on equal terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When private operators lose money, they have to fund those losses themselves. They cannot ask Parliament to bail them out. Yet British Airways have been cushioned from international competition and —in recent years—from domestic competition. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
Government are committed to breaking State monopolies, and I hope that the Minister will liberalise domestic routes, not just international routes. If competition is to mean anything, it must mean giving the consumer a good deal by allowing the private and public sectors to compete on equal terms. At present, market forces are distorted with a bias towards the State carrier, but the private sector should be given equal chances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the domestic routes, British Airways have withdrawn from unprofitable routes and private airlines have moved in. They have dramatically cut the losses that British Airways made on those routes, but unless they can get a look-in on some of the prime routes which British Airways now enjoy and break the monopoly hold which British Airways currently have, many of those private operators will go under. They cannot continue to subsidise loss-making routes if they cannot get a look-in on some of the profitable routes. So I hope that the Minister will comment on the possibility of liberalising domestic routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, problems will arise because the Civil Aviation Authority is there to grant licences. One of the problems is that until the former Secretary of State reversed the CAA's finding the Hong Kong route was run only by British Airways. The right hon. Gentleman allowed the privatisation of the Hong Kong route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I hope that the Minister will tell the Committee about the liberalisation of domestice routes. If private operators want to compete with British Airways, they should not be prevented from doing so by the Civil Aviation Authority, provided that they do so on a high-load route and one which can stand competition. It is quite wrong for the CAA to grant licences for non-profitable low-load carrying routes and refuse licences on the high-load carrying routes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend concede that under the Civil Aviation Act 1980, which passes much of the responsibility from the Government to the Civil Aviation Authority for the granting of licences, one of the considerations that the CAA is bound to take into account is the continuing viability of existing services if a new carrier is allowed on the route? If my hon. Friend's plea were accepted across the board, the chances are that new services might well appear on a domestic route but only at the risk of losing those services that already serve that route.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) makes a fair point, subject to one proviso. The Civil Aviation Authority is not opposed to granting licences to private airlines, even if it means that they will compete with other private airlines on low-load routes, such as the Channel Islands. The private airlines have a scheduled service from London and elsewhere to the Channel Islands. I understand that this year the CAA has approved other private operators, particularly for holiday traffic during the high-peak season, and it has meant that the scheduled operator now faces severe competition during the part of the year in which it expects to make a profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
So although my hon. Friend has a valid argument, it is only as good as the extent to which it stands up to the argument not just about trunk routes but about low-load routes. If the CAA were to refuse to grant licences for private operators to compete with other private operators. I would agree with my hon. Friend. But if the CAA were to grant licences to private operators to compete with other private operators on low-load routes, so that they all fought for crumbs, it would be quite wrong on the high-load routes—Glasgow, which has 1 million passengers a year, Edinburgh and Manchester—if British Airways were not encouraged to provide a better service by fair competition. Either we liberalise the routes and do it fairly as between the low-load and high-load routes, or we have a discriminatory policy. In my opinion, the CAA appears to be embarking on a discriminatory policy which allows competition on routes where there is no money to be made, but dees not allow competition with British Airways where there is money to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But was not the CAA decision on the London-Glasgow route not only a refusal to allow BMA, an independent operator, to go on the route in competition with British Airways, but a refusal to let it go en the route in competition with British Caledonian which, whatever my hon. Friend may say, flies a London to Glasgow route? Does he not accept that what he is saying is not valid, based on the very example that he gave?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extremely valid. With respect, what my hon. Friend is saying is less valid. I do not have the figures with me, but I understand that the Glasgow flight from London airport has 1 million passengers a year. There is great scope for private competition. I gather that the same opportunity does not exist on the Gatwick service. I accept my hon. Friend's argument, if he is saying that the British Caledonian flight is packed full and that there should be competition, because that is what happens at Heathrow. If he is saying that the British Caledonian service is not full and is running at a loss, of course we should not put competitors on that route. There is a world of difference between Heathrow and Gatwick. As I am sure my hon. Friend is aware, hon. Members fly from Heathrow. They tend not to fly from Gatwick, although it provides an excellent service. With respect, my hon. Friend does not appreciate the distinction, but I hope that he will do so in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rest of my notes have been removed, so I am in some difficulty. However, I shall not be deterred. The Civil Aviation Authority is known to be impartial. It produces a number of splendid arguments to rebut the claims of private operators to be allowed to fly domestic routes which are profitable. While I am in no way chastising or criticising the Civil Aviation Authority, it is only fair to say that a great number of its staff come from British Airways. It is a known fact that there is a great interchange between British Airways and the Civil Aviation Authority. Many of the people who are adjudicating on British Airways' applications may well be former British Airways staff or may
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
have been seconded from British Airways, I do not know if hon. Member's are aware that there is substantial traffic between the Civil Aviation Authority and British Airways. I can see that some Opposition Members know that to be true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made my most telling points. The trouble with being in advance of my time is that not all hon. Members of the Committee appreciate the finer points of the argument. However, it is fair to say that the Minister—who is an enlightened man who understands progressive arguments—will take my speech in the spirit in which it was meant. Both sides of the Committee are concerned, despite the jollities we have shared, about privatising the domestic routes. I hope the Minister will examine that point with great interest and care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by thanking you, Mr. Mitchell, and the hon. Member for Batley and Morley (Mr. Woolmer) for agreeing to this group of amendments being considered together. It has given rise to an extremely important and wide-ranging debate. Although a number of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee said that they originally thought that the Committee would finish its deliberations by the end of our previous sitting, I am sure that the decision to allow the debate on this series of amendments to continue has been a worthwhile exercise and has raised a number of matters with which I shall attempt to deal in detail. It is a continuing debate and, no doubt, it can be continued by correspondence or on the Floor of the House at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be for the convenience of the Committee if, as in the previous debate on the British Airports Authority, I replied first in general terms and then picked up individual points raised by members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The financial limit of £1,600 million proposed is designed to cover British Airways' needs for borrowings and other investment for at least five years. That is the usual time horizon when setting nationalised industries' financial limits. That is not to say that we expect British Airways necessarily to reach the limit in five years. It is impossible to forecast the borrowing needs over such a long time for British Airways or any other public enterprise. To show that the figure is not an implausible one, I remind the Committee that last year, 1980-81, British Airways' net requirement for external funds was more than £300 million, while this year, 1981-82, it is more than £100 million. Admittedly, these have been bad years for British Airways and other airlines. Next year, 1982-83, we expect them to do much better as a result of the retrenchment programme which Sir John King and Mr. Roy Watts are implementing. Even so, in the two following years, 1983-84 and 1984-85, they still expect to need nearly £100 million of external funds in each year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Airways continue to need to spend considerable sums on capital investment, just to replace their present fleet with more modern aircraft—aircraft that are more fuel efficient and less noisy than
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
the older aircraft in their present fleet. Even with the improved profitability for which we all hope, it is impossible for British Airways to meet those capital needs entirely from their own internal resources. Hence the continuing need for borrowing for which the Bill provides. I underline to my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Mr. Steen) that we are considering capital needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In writing an ultimate limit of £1,600 million into the Bill, we are concerned to obviate the need for further primary legislation in the future on British Airways' financial limits. When I say " the future ", I refer to the next five years. The Government do not wish to overburden the legislature and, as both sides of the Committee know, the Government are always bringing such Bills forward for either approval or rejection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise to the Committee—as I said on previous occasions on the British Airports Authority amendments and on Second Reading—that parliamentary scrutiny remains very close. The Secretary of State's order must in each case be made by statutory instrument subject to affirmative resolution of the House of Commons. The size of each increase—that is, £200 million—is designed to allow a reasonable time between each order. The gap of £100 million implied in the first two amendments is too small and could involve the Government asking the House to increase the limit within a year of the previous increase. I believe that that would strain the patience of hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that the hon. Members who tabled the amendments are concerned about the public sector borrowing requirement as, indeed, we all are. I remind the Committee that the increases in the financial limits will not in themselves allow British Airways to borrow freely up to these levels. I have made that clear about the British Airports Authority, and the same principle applies to British Airways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By virtue of section 5 of the British Airways Board Act 1977, British Airways may only borrow, even within the financial limits, with the consent or authorisation of the Secretary of State, who in turn requires the approval of the Treasury. It is that which will allow the Government to ensure that British Airways' borrowings in any one year keep within the external financing limits. Consequently, there will be no uncontrolled effects on the public sector borrowing requirement. I hope that that emphasis of what I said earlier about the British Airports Authority will reassure hon. Members on both sides of the Committee that we have no intention of allowing the borrowing limits to move outside parliamentary scrutiny and the ultimate sanction of Parliament to say " No ", if Parliament so decides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 7. I believe that I should put the financial limits provided for in clause 2 into their proper perspective because I do not want too much to be read into them. The maximum limit of £1,600 million has been proposed with the main aim of avoiding further primary legislation within too short a period—in this case at least the next five years. I emphasise that it does not repre-
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
sent a statement of intention from the Government to allow British Airways to borrow up to that level. Neither would we expect the airlines borrowings to reach that particular level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that it was extremely difficult to estimate what the borrowings could possibly be for a corporation of that size over such a lengthy period as five years. That is so particularly when privatisation is in the air at the moment and because British Airways have just been through a bad time. Indeed, it has been a bad time for all airlines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although British Airways made a substantial loss last year and we expect another loss this year, it will not be as bad as the figure mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Wavertree. Nevertheless, there are airlines around the world that have succeded in making profits in both years. There are private sector British airlines that have made profits this year and last year. We are not simply talking about more efficient or, for that matter, less efficient American airlines such as Pan American. I hope that my hon. Friends will be reassured that we are extremely keen to keep the closest parliamentary scrutiny of these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deal with amendment No. 13 in two stages. The first part of the amendment attempts to remove British Airways' powers to borrow under the 1977 Act after any shares in a limited company to be formed to hold the British Airways board's assets have been sold. The whole of the 1977 Act will be repealed by virtue of section 8 of the Civil Aviation Act 1980 on the vesting of the board's assets in the successor company—that is, even before any shares of any successor company have been sold. I am happy to debate the principle, but I wish to explain the technicalities. The amendment is therefore unnecessary. The successor company's entitlement to borrow will be determined by its own memorandum and articles of association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other half of the amendment dealing with asset disposals raises some extremely practical objections. As it stands, the amendment attempts effectively to debar British Airways from making even the most necessary asset disposals of, for instance, aircraft or property for which there is no longer a use because thereafter the airline would be 
	<i>ultra vires</i> in drawing on any further borrowings or public dividend capital. Whatever the views of hon. Members on privatisation or continuing nationalisation, this cannot be right. Any business must surely be free to sell assets that are not needed or are obsolete without inviting such dire consequences as the Opposition seek in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Airways must surely be allowed to decide which assets or which subsidiaries are necessary to, and compatible with, their business. British Airways must be free to dispose of assets that are not so, with the aim of achieving the most streamlined and efficient shape possible. I am not saying anything particularly sinister. If British Airways considered that certain aircraft were obsolete, it would be ridiculous to say that the airline was not allowed to sell them. I am very happy to discuss privatisation with Opposition Members, but if they wish to debar it, this amendment will not achieve that aim.

It happens that the amendment is legally defective. I hope that hon. Members will seek to withdraw the amendment in the light of my remarks, although I am happy to go into the details of why it is defective if they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to some of the specific matters that have been raised. An extremely important point, raised by the hon. Member for Batley and Morley and taken up by a number of my hon. Friends, particularly my hon. Friends the Members for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) and for Waver-tree, is the issue of fare levels on the North Atlantic, domestic and European routes. One reason why I am glad that the debate has lengthened is that some extremely important matters for the whole future of civil aviation arise directly out of what might at first seem to be narrow amendments. I am grateful to the Opposition for phrasing their amendments in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer first to the North Atlantic. I accept entirely that there cannot be any question of 100 per cent, right on one side and 100 per cent, wrong on the other. We are walking a high and dangerous tightrope. On the one side, there are the benefits to the consumer that low fares have undoubtedly brought. On the other, there are the dangers to the financial stability of the airlines that low fares have brought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members should bear in mind that low fares on the North Atlantic have arisen out of the Bermuda 2 Agreement. The agreement has meant that last year, for the first time ever, the three British carriers on the North Atlantic routes managed to carry more passengers than the nine American carriers on the routes. That is a wonderful achievement for British Airways, British Caledonian and Laker Airways. It would be wrong to dismiss low fares as a disaster from the commercial point of view, although possibly benefiting the traveller.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our civil aviation industry has done extremely well out of Bermuda 2. I want to see this stability maintained. I want also to see the low fares that have been pioneered by British airlines maintained, consonant and in harmony with the long-term financial stability of the airlines, particularly since we are discussing British Airways and their profitability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Batley and Morley drew attention to what I hope will be an extremely important meeting of IATA to discuss this matter. Those represented at the meeting are understandably more concerned about airline finances than consumer benefits. I hope none the less that we shall see emerging some perceived strategy showing how airlines will manage to live with fares that are not necessarily as low as now but that will command the approval of the consumer in general terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
European fares, in a curious way, are even more complex. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar has already referred to the fact that on some routes, costs appear extremely high. On some of the Scandinavian routes, they are
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
extremely high. On other routes in Europe, they are not so high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a meeting of transport Ministers next Tuesday in Brussels when two matters of interest to the Committee will be discussed. One is interregional air services. This relates to whether airlines should be allowed to fly between Liverpool and Munich or between Aberdeen and Naples, as opposed to London to Copenhagen, London to Paris and London to Frankfurt. The Government will, I am sure, have the Opposition's support in taking the strongest line in saying that there should be the maximisation of travel between our regional airports with benefits not only to travellers who live in those areas and who therefore avoid having to go through London but also to employment in the airlines themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We face extremely dogged opposition from some of our European partners, particularly the Danes and the Germans. The fact that the Social Democrats have taken something of a beating in Denmark in the last 48 hours may mean some relaxation in Denmark's attitude. My Hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar shakes his head. It may be the case that we see some little movement. I spent a couple of days in Copenhagen this week. I do not say that I contributed to the election result. I hope, nevertheless, that there will be some movement. However hard we try in these matters, it is not possible for us to do what we want because we need the approval of the States into which we fly as well as the States out of which we fly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other question that will be discussed is the liberalisation of air fares. We shall get no definite result on that next week. We shall put our case forcibly, but I have no high hopes. On the regional services, I do not put our chances higher than 50-50, but we shall do our best. I hope that the hon. Member for Batley and Morley will feel that I have answered the important points he made about fare levels on the North Atlantic and in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot be so forthcoming or so agreeable about privatisation. The hon. Member for Batley and Morley asked whether this was not an illusion. I must tell him that it is not an illusion. It is an immutable pledge of the Government to privatise British Airways. Secondly, it is our immutable pledge to privatise them as quickly as practicable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct. It is my intention to bring the trade unions and the work force generally into close discussions on the matter. We heard an interesting statement from the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin) in the previous debate following a shrewd question by my hon. Friend the Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins) asking the hon. Gentleman what would be the case if members of the work force were offered shares. It was greatly to the credit of the hon. Member for Springburn that he admitted that he wished to see that happen. I also wish to see the work force sharing to a large extent in the equity flotation that we make, because it is important that employees have a direct share in their company's profits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Atkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's remarks. Will my hon. Friend consider, when the flotation takes place, whether those who work for British Airways should have an option on the shares and favourable consideration as to the price of those shares, related also to the length of time for which they have worked for the company? We may end up with the same success story as British Aerospace, where more than 50,000 employees could take advantage of shares, depending upon how long they had worked there and their positions. That exciting challenge was met by British Aerospace and the Government, which will benefit the aviation idustry through British Airways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct, and I agree entirely with those sentiments. When we get down to such details, I wish to ask all my hon. Friends on the Committee and others for suggestions about how best we can proceed. I should also be grateful for suggestions from the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Eastham) because he has made a valuable point, about how the work force could benefit to the maximum extent from the flotation of British Airways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to pension rights, a matter which was raised quite properly by the hon. Member for Bat-ley and Morley. First, what happens to the pensions is entirely a matter for British Airways. I nail the allegation that I understand was made at a recent meeting between British Airways management and unions that somehow it was a part of a Government ploy. That is not the case. British Airways have asserted—I make no comment about it—that their pension fund at the moment stands at about £2,000 million. They pay out £65 million in pensions each year, and they wish to save £20 million of that. The matter is currently under discussion, but it has nothing to do with the Government and it has nothing to do with whether or not to privatise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Batley and Morley raised an interesting question—which I could not answer at the time—about the percentage of the investment that would go towards purchasing aircraft and what percentage to the non-purchase of aircraft. That is important. The answer is that 25 per cent, of the investment will be in non-purchase of aircraft— matters such as engineering, computers and sales offices. The remainder of the investment will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
in aircraft for the reasons that I have given about the need to have more fuel-efficient and less noisy aircraft.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Woolmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While we are on that, can the Minister clarify the matter raised by Conservative Members today about the extent to which the loan finance may be available to cover the costs of severance payments? It seems that the cost to British Airways varies between £70 million and the figure given last night of £100 million. Can the Minister assure us that no part of the increase in borrowing powers is to enable loan finance, which I understand to be a one-off cost—to be used for the capitalisation of future benefits of about £100 million a year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is natural that the hon. Gentleman should raise that, especially after the meeting between Opposition Members and Sir John King yesterday evening. I was not at the meeting, so I am not sure of his latest figures. As we do not know how many British Airways employees may wish to have redundancy pay, I cannot say what the figures will be. All that I can truthfully tell Opposition Members is that it was necessary for the Bill to come forward long before redundancy payments were thought of and before the present plan was put into operation. I cannot foretell the final outcome, but I underline what I said on Second Reading, which is that the sheer fluctuation of currency exchange rates can have the most debilitating effect upon British Airways' borrowing. I am speaking off the top of my head, but I believe that a change of 10 cents can mean £15 million more for British Airways' borrowings. Their debt has increased by about £30 million or £40 million in the past financial year alone because of currency fluctuations between the pound and the dollar. That is why we are extremely keen to get the Bill through quickly. The reason for the increase is the necessity for an investment programme to enable British Airways to have more fuel-efficient and less noisy aircraft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the other point made by the hon. Member for Batley and Morley about the emphasis that was placed during the previous debate on the ratio between the external and internal funds of the British Airports Authority. That does not arise with British Airways for the rather sad reason of the extravagant losses that they made last year and which we believe they will make this year. There is no question of their having extra internal resources easily available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Norwood (Mr. Wilkinson), in his vigorous and interesting speech, emphasised the need for privatisation to proceed as swifdy as possible. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said that the speed at which we privatised should be determined not entirely by political considerations but perhaps more by financial ones. I assure both my hon. Friends that it would be entitrely wrong for the Government to consider the timing of privatisation without taking both matters into account. I shall tread a Solomon-like path through those matters, but I take the important points made by my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood, that our first need is to get the airline into profit. That is what Sir John King and Mr. Roy Watts are doing with all the vigorous managerial tools at their command. Sir John King said that he hoped that, at the end of 1982-83, British Airways would be in profit, and I hope that that will be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend emphasised a point that I made earlier when he was detained outside the Committee room. Of course, we accept the principle that he enunciated of encouraging the acquisition of equity by employees. That was emphasised by the hon. Member for Blackley, the hon: Member for Spring-burn and my hon. Friend, and we shall seek to ensure that that principle is embodied in our plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) spoke about press releases. As he knows, the issuing of press releases is a matter for the BA board. I am happy to discuss it in other contexts with him, but I do not have powers to intervene on it, and I do not want to. He criticised the shuttle and the cattle truck syndrome. I undertake to ensure that those matters are drawn to the attention of the BA board, although he may have taken the opportunity to do that yesterday. Again, purchasing of aircraft is a matter for the BA board. I am sure that some of my hon. Friends will say that the fact that in the past it was not a matter for the BA board worked to the disadvantage of British Airways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I now have a little good news for the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is out of character.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The news concerns a Prestwick rail link. Immediately after our last sitting, I raised the matter with Mr. Bill Gregson, the Scottish director of the BAA. He said that the rail link could not be a direct matter for the BAA, but that it recognised its importance. He has contacted British Rail in Scotland, and British Rail have undertaken to put forward a proposal as quickly as possible. Having said that, I should not like to raise the hopes of hon. Members, because it must depend on potential traffic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eastham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's comments about a rail link are encouraging.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I discussed the matter briefly when I was in Manchester, and I undertake to look at it specifically when I visit Manchester in the near future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I realise that there are still a number of hurdles to get over before the Prestwick rail link problem is resolved—including persuading British Rail—it would be ungracious of me not to thank the Minister for his speedy action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very kind of the hon. Gentleman. We have a mutual interest in promoting the efficiency of British civil aviation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar rightly said that we could not contract out of the fare level structure. I hope that I have made it clear that I accept that and that there is a difficult balance to be struck. I am acutely aware of the difficulties, and I shall attempt to pursue the path that is best for both sides. That applies both to the North Atlantic and to Europe. We are studying closely the effects of deregulation in the United States. At this stage, it is not possible to say what has been the result of deregulation and what has been the result of the world recession, but we are monitoring it closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to competition and Hong Hong, I say to my hon. Friends on both sides of the narrow divide between competition and non-competition that the matter is not as clear as they seem to believe. I asked all the airlines whether they were in profit on the London-Hong Kong route. Cathay Pacific assured me both verbally and in writing that it was making a satisfactory profit. British Caledonian assured me that it was making a profit, although its tone of voice was not quite as forceful as that of Cathay Pacific. We all know that Mr. Adam Thomson, a great man, always speaks with a soft voice and that it is generally difficult to know when he is making a strong point. British Airways have not told me whether they are making a profit. I am trying to find out the position, but so far, for understandable commercial reasons, they are being slightly coy. It rather depends on how one defines an operating profit or loss. On balance, the decision taken by the Government of Hong Kong has proved to be right, but world trade and world recession distorts the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, the fact that the British Midland application for Scottish routes is now the subject of an appeal means that I cannot comment on it, but I have noted my hon. Friend's remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said that he hoped he had made some pertinent points on discounted fares. He did. I said that I was grateful to you, Mr. Mitchell, for allowing the debate to go> so wide. I am not sure now whether I am quite so grateful, but this matter is relevant. First, I took it somewhat amiss that British Airways announced that they proposed to do something illegal. That comes ill from a nationalised industry, under whatever pressure. It was wrong for Mr. Gerry Draper to say what he did in the way that he did, and I shall make that clear to him. None the less, we all know that there is a severe problem over discounted air fares. I assure my hon. Friend that I am having the matter examined to see whether there is a way out of this impasse that is legal, fair to the profits of the airlines and yet does not contravene the natural justice of a willing buyer and a willing seller.

The hon. Member for Central Ayrshire asked about British Airports Authority user charges. He knows that I cannot comment on that because there is a case before the courts. It would be improper for me to say anything further now. He referred to my dinner with Mr. Norman Payne and his board. It was an enjoyable dinner, and I was extremely impressed with the board and with the speed at which it took up the points that were raised. I hope that I am not out of order, Mr. Mitchell, in saying that I raised the matters of the duty-free shops and the authority's apparent unawareness that winter usually hit this country in December.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in dealing with the present British Airports Authority charges, but I do not think that he is inhibited from dealing with or expressing an opinion on the proposed charges.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Mitchell. That is indeed the fact of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make two points about the Concorde. First, the British and French Governments are currently in general discussion about what is to happen to the Concorde in the future. It is quite wrong to say either that British Airways will continue indefinitely with the Concorde or that it will not. We must face the fact that this is a joint venture between the British and French Governments and that we must proceed with agreement on both sides. We must also bear in mind that the venture has already cost the taxpayer about £2,000 million. Therefore, if we are to continue with the Concorde indefinitely, we must find a way to make a proper profit on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eastham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The cost of the Concorde to the taxpayer is a fair point, but there have been many spin-off benefits which the Government often fail to quantify. The Concorde technology has resulted in additional trade for us. Should not that factor be quantified at some point, rather than casually stating that the project has cost the taxpayer so many thousand million pounds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a general statement, that is true. Many factors in life cannot be quantified in money terms, and no doubt there are some connected with the Concorde. I assure the hon. Gentleman that although we cannot quantify some of the other benefits, we shall take them into account. Nevertheless, we must also consider the hard financial facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the Federal Express option, I should dearly love to see it come to Prestwick if the whole deal could be signed up. There is a possibility of the deal going ahead even if it does not come to Prestwick, but I hope very much that it will. This, of course, is necessarily predicated upon the continuance of the Concorde. We are trying to keep
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
the two sets of negotiations in step, but it is not easy. We are doing our best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I turn to the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Mr. Steen). He made a very successful point about Hong Kong. His point about the Glasgow to London route was less happy. Without going into the load factors, which I have in precise detail in my head but which are confidential, I assure him that his statement that British Airways outcarry British Caledonian to a massive extent is not correct. For commercial reasons, I cannot go into the details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talked about privatising British Airways and the Hong Kong service. Does he propose to privatise the domestic routes as far as possible as well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that. As a general rule, we favour competition. We wish to encourage it wherever possible, but, as my hon. Friend recognises, there are occasions when it is not as easy as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should put on record that if British Airways or Dan-Air believe that the other is running flights from London to Aberdeen at a non-economic fare which is not cost related, there is a simple remedy. It is open to Dan-Air to attack British Airways on the grounds that their fare is too low and to require the Civil Aviation Authority to raise it, or vice versa. The matter is in the airline's own hands. If it believes that the fare is uneconomic, let it take the proof to the CAA, and the CAA will then act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a purely technical amendment, and I hope not to detain the Committee too long. Nevertheless it is only proper that I should at least put on record why we feel that it is necessary. I shall outline briefly the purpose of clause 3(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) provides that the sterling value of British Airways foreign currency borrowings should normally be calculated, for the purposes of assessing British Airways' position against the financial limit, by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the last working day before the loans were received by British Airways. It thus fixes the sterling value of foreign currency loans against the financial limit, in contrast to existing legislation under which British Airways foreign currency loans have to be valued according to current exchange rates and have fluctuated widely in value as a result, as I pointed out on the previous amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why I am now proposing that foreign currency overdrafts should be excluded from subsection (1) is that the new method of valuation would not be easily applicable to them. As many of my hon. Friends will know from bitter personal experience, overdrafts involve a constantly moving balance and are subject to a far greater number of transactions than the medium and long-term borrowings for which subsection (1) was intended. It would be unnecessarily complex and expensive for British Airways to value each drawing on their overdraft according to subsection (1) and then to keep track of how much of it had been repaid under subsection (2) in order to calculate the sterling value of the outstanding overdraft against the financial limit at any given time. For those reasons, I believe that it is better to exclude foreign currency overdrafts altogether from subsection (1), which means that they will continue to be valued as they would be now— that is, at current exchange rates. This will not reintroduce a significant element of uncertainty into the assessment of British Airways' position against the financial limit, because British Airways' foreign
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
currency overdrafts will always be very small—certainly not more than £10 million initially—in comparison with their medium and long-term currency loans, which as the Committee knows, already amount to many hundreds of millions of pounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of that technical explanation, I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Woolmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the only opportunity for a last word in the Committee, and I want to say two. First, I do not normally like having to do business quite as quickly as we have today. I understand that it was a matter that was not the fault of either side of the Committee. I wish in all circumstances to make progress, but I emphasise again, so that I am not misunderstood, that the speed of the Committee has left unexplored many matters that hon. Members would otherwise have wished to discuss more fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I thank you, Mr. Mitchell, for the helpful way that you have chaired the Committee. I thank the Minister for his helpful and courteous responses, although not always to our satisfaction, to many of the points made to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add a few words to that, Mr. Mitchell. First, I thank the Opposition for tabling down amendments which allowed us to discuss these important matters in such detail without acrimony and in a thought-provoking way. Secondly, I thank you, Mr. Mitchell, for the helpful way in which you have presided over the Committee. I am sure that your manner, both firm and affable, has contributed to the happy result that we now have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
