	<div class='debates'>

	<section>

	<div class='bill'>Food Law and Consumer Health Safety</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agiculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome on behalf of the Government the opportunity to debate two important documents that were published by the European Commission this year. They were presented by the Commission as representing a new approach to consumer health and food safety, which will benefit both consumers and the industries involved in producing and supplying food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first document, the communication on consumer health and food safety, describes the reorganisation of the Commission's departments dealing with consumer health. The scientific committees that give advice have been grouped together in one directorate-general under Commissioner Bonino, and the system has been strengthened by the establishment of a steering committee, which will consider issues that affect more than one policy area. Appointments to the committee will follow advertisements rather than nominations from member states. Commission officials responsible for monitoring member states' enforcement and inspection activities have also been transferred to the directorate-general and their working methods have been reviewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report of the Select Committee on European Legislation states that the three principles set out in the document, of scientific excellence, independence and transparency, are ones that we can endorse—a view that I hope members of this Committee share. However, the Select Committee is concerned about how the new arrangements will operate and how they will fit in with national arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The developments have the potential to strengthen the process of obtaining independent scientific advice in the European Union and improving the openness of the process. That is consistent with some of the changes that we are making in the United Kingdom to establish the food standards agency, under which there will be greater independence and transparency based on reliance on the best available scientific advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's second document, the Green Paper on the general principles of food law in the European Union, is a detailed survey of European Union food law and poses many questions about the future direction of policy. It sets out six fundamental goals of Community law; it considers the scope for repeal of existing law or extensions into new areas and it describes the means adopted to ensure effective implementation of agreed rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
The Government are the first to admit that the Green Paper poses questions rather than offers solutions, but we agree with the Select Committe that it must be seen as an influential text for the future, because it has started a debate among all interested parties, not just member states. The Government have set out to ensure that United Kingdom interests take a full part in that debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We widely publicised the Green Paper and provided a copy of it on request. We also arranged meetings with key organisations representing consumers, retailers, manufacturers and producers. Some 24 organisations have shown us their response to the Commission, although others may have sent it in direct. While all the organisations broadly welcome the opportunity of a debate on the future of European Union food law, consumer groups by and large seek more harmonisation of the rules, for example, on claims, nutrition and labelling. On the other hand, industry has argued for consolidation and simplification of the existing rules, and for better efforts to be made on implementation and enforcement. The Government have responded publicly to the Commission and copied their response to other member states and interested organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Brussels, the Luxembourg presidency is having open debates on the Green Paper in four councils—the Agriculture, Consumer, Internal Market and Health Councils. The European Parliament and the Commission held a joint meeting of invited representatives of member states and interest groups earlier this month. Following those debates, I hope that the Commission will feel able to synthesise the comments received and draw the appropriate practical conclusions as soon as possible. In our view, a more rational and systematic approach to food law within the Community is long overdue. The next step should be agreement within the Council on a medium-term plan for staged implementation of the necessary legislative reforms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, the Government would like to see the European Union food law move from a producer-orientated to a consumer-orientated perspective. However, it must be made crystal clear that we are talking of the genuine and legitimate needs of consumers and not of giving legislators, wherever they are, carte blanche to introduce new forms of protectionism based on spurious subjective criteria or to react to every food scare with draconian new restrictions. Consumers want to be able to rely on controls that guarantee the safety of food, but they also want diversity and choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provided that safety regulations are met, the Government will continue to oppose rules that narrow the range of foods available and prohibit foods or processes that do not conform to a traditional recipe or process from one part or another of the Community. We believe that more information must be made available to consumers, including that provided on food labels, to allow them to make an informed choice. Indeed, we made it clear in our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
written response that a widening of consumer choice should be seen as a seventh fundamental objective of European Union food law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Community's food law has, for many reasons, developed in an unco-ordinated way; most members of the Committee will understand why. Applying the principles of subsidiarity in such a situation is difficult. The time has come to devise a common policy—perhaps in the form of a general food directive—to establish common principles and definitions; it should be tied coherently to more detailed horizontal directives on labelling, additives, nutrition and so on, and expanded to vertical controls only when necessary on particular foods. It is crucial that enforcement officers should have simple, clear legislation to follow, legislation that ordinary people can understand, and which can be enforced uniformly across the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the paper offers more questions than solutions. I can therefore be asked a wide range of questions this morning. I shall do my best to answer hon. Members. If I cannot, I shall give them a written response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to Question Time. We have until 11.30 am at the latest for questions to the Minister. I remind Members that questions should be brief and should be asked one at a time. There should be ample opportunity for everyone to pose all the questions that they wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the first part of the Ministry's response to the Green Paper, why has no overall assessment been made of the effectiveness of the current range of European food law in achieving the objective of the safe supply of food? Will the Ministry publish such a commentary, so that we can at least see where we are coming from as we discuss where we might be going?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point, which the Ministry has raised continually since May. Every time a question has arisen on a particular policy or requirement, we have tried to check how our partners operate. It has not always been easy to get answers. The Ministry is pursuing that matter over a range of issues. However, in the context of the right hon. Gentleman's question, I shall try to ensure that we get an answer. It is an answer that we need ourselves—whether it is on food law throughout the food chain, the implementation of regulations and directives, or even under-implementation whether it is the result of accidental or deliberate policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point has to be taken into account in the continuing discussions on the Green Paper. There is a long way to go before we achieve a common European policy on food law, but the right hon. Gentleman knows that from his past experience at the Ministry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many deaths have been caused by bacterial poisoning in the past five years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the specific answer. If I tried to guess, I would be wildly inaccurate; I would not know the source of the poisoning. The hon. Gentleman's question is like asking, "What has caused the continuing increase in general food poisoning?", to which no one knows the specific answer. General food poisoning is increasing year on year. Even with all the checks, extra regulation and enforcement measures that we have adopted throughout the food chain, there has been a constant increase in the number of cases. From memory, I should say that there are 86,000 known cases of food poisoning a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much money do we spend each year on food safety enforcement measures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A considerable amount of money, especially given the catastrophic increase in the amount that the Government have had to spend on measures to control bovine spongiform encephalopathy, which are food safety enforcement measures. Although the money is ring-fenced, more than £1 billion is spent on BSE measures. A massive part of the Department's expenditure is involved in food regulation, labelling, the Meat Hygiene Service, which recovers part of its costs from the industry, and the Dairy Hygiene Service. Local authorities are estimated to spend between £150 million and £180 million a year on their enforcement role in the food process, and they then report to the Department of Health. Hundreds of millions of pounds are spent on food safety and, if the extra food safety measures involved in BSE are included, the sum is in the billions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Minister back to the first question that my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) asked about the sources of food poisoning? As the Minister has said, a comprehensive examination of European food law is being undertaken. Is any work being done within the Commission to identify the sources of food poisoning or unsafe food either at the manufacturing, transport and storage levels or at the consumer level? The Minister rightly referred to the consumer dimension, but consumers are the end point and there are questions of food safety in the home. If the targeting of the new food law is to be right, surely there must be some analysis of where the cause of the problem lies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the point is that countries operate what can be seen as centralised regulations differently. I shall cite an example, which relates partly to the Committee's debate last week when you did not have the privilege of being in the Chair, Mr. Anderson. We propose that the spinal cord of sheep over 12 months old should be removed as a precautionary measure and that that should be done in licensed premises such as abattoirs. In France, that will be done at retail butchers. Therefore, one begins to consider whether problems of surveillance, illness and contamination might occur simply because different methods are adopted within the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept the argument that we are the only ones playing by the rules of cricket; Community nations have different ways of operating some of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
regulations. Each country has different measures on food poisoning. However, many issues in this country are homed in on. Every time a headline refers to a problem, our ambassadors send us telegrams about the extremely bad publicity that the press in the European Union give to our food industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Work is being done. In fact, we cannot have a common food law, with regulations based on the six principles enunciated in the Green Paper, unless the necessary scientific and practical evidence is available as to how to enforce the measures needed to reduce particular problems such as poisoning. The information is not available in the simplistic—that is not meant as a criticism of the question—form that I, and the right hon. Member for Fylde, would like it to be available. Such information should be available to us. However, it simply is not available in that way within the Community as presently structured. Directorate-General XXIV is doing some work on that matter, pulling together the reorganisation of food law in the Community. That is a new operation within the administration of that body. I freely admit that there are some turf wars between the Commission and member states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just said that he suspects that DG XXIV is doing some work on that matter and he has referred to the reorganisation of the scientific committees. May I solicit an undertaking from the Minister that he will find out—rather than merely suspect—what DG XXIV is doing and publish the work that it is undertaking on that matter? Is he personally satisfied that Commissioner Bonino has sufficient resources at her disposal to make the new scientific superstructure that is being created effective? Is she able properly to monitor its work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard nothing from the European Commission to the effect that it has insufficient resources for its scientific committees. Those committees are being reorganised, and there are moves to make them much more open and transparent—something for which we have pushed. The Government are resourcing the British members of the scientific committees. They will have an increased work load as a result of the necessary changes that are being made. We will offer our members factual briefings—they are under no obligation to use that information, but it will be provided. We will want to check how the scientific committees operate and what is their end product. However, I am unaware that anything has been said to the effect that Commissioner Bonino is short of funds for the reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reverting to the Minister's answer to the question of my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), does he accept that the incidence of food poisoning can to a greater or lesser extent be attributed to the fact that the powers that be have failed to identify the high risk areas and have perhaps concentrated too much on bona fide traders, rather than on those who are operating a little beyond the law? If the inspectors were doing their job properly,
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
would not they be analysing the high risk areas, rather than attempting blanket coverage of the whole industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is to place resources where the perceived risk lies. That is the purpose behind the hazard analysis and critical control point system. For example, the idea of the Pennington proposals for retail butchers is not to introduce a blanket plan but to get butchers to do what anyone could do in a domestic kitchen, namely to look for the critical points and the risks and spend money on those areas, rather than on blanket work. The hon. Gentleman is right about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the onset of the BSE crisis from March 1996—leaving aside the period before that, when the problem was not taken quite so seriously—the requirements of the European Union have forced us to take blanket action across the board to check specified risk materials in abattoirs and cutting plants, for example. However, when checking for food poisoning, those involved in the enforcement process have to consider perceived risk, and not waste money in areas where risk is considered to be negligible. We must be guided by science as well as by common sense and if science points to areas of greater risk, that is where we must shift resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not intend to send food police into every nook and cranny of shops, cutting plants and abattoirs—far from it. We need to check to ensure that a product is safe, healthy and wholesome, so that consumers can have confidence, and to spend money in the areas of highest perceived risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister agrees that in the three major outbreaks of E. coli there was evidence of cross-contamination between fresh food and cooked food. Surely the inspectorate should have concentrated on flagging up those hazards. One can argue that if it had done so earlier, those serious outbreaks could have been prevented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not responsible for matters north of the border but, as I understand it, the premises of John Barr were among the most inspected, yet people died as a result of eating products from the shop. The Pennington report recommended a more systematic process of assessing hazards, checking control points and, in some cases, taking draconian action against the retail trade. We need to ensure that cooked and fresh meats are separated, that there is more and better refrigeration and that handling processes are separated. There is a need for much more widespread action to protect the consumer. I know that the hon. Gentleman is not saying that, because only a few people died, we should not take such action, but we believe that a few is too many.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware of the continuing problem of counterfeiting of brand names in this country and across the Community? Are our European Union partners taking as robust a line as we are to ensure that food products are up to the standards that we expect for our consumers, both nutritionally and in terms of safety? Will he comment on the experience of our partners?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0088">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, it is an offence to make a claim on a label that is proved to be wrong. As to retail, if people make complaints—Members of Parliament hear them regularly from constituents; I have received two this week—the local authority trading standards department can take the necessary enforcement action and, if the case comes to court, legal action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is needed—we shall have press for it—are rules that are applied throughout the European Union. We believe that European food labelling rules must be reviewed and consolidated. That should flow from the work that arises from the Green Paper. As we know from recent court cases, British manufacturers have been caught trying to sell products that they claimed were produced where they clearly were not, which is most unfortunate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is right to raise the issue. I am unaware of large-scale labelling fraud, but counterfeiting—of labels and the product itself—is a major business for the spiv trade in this country and abroad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I follow through the point on labelling raised by the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn)? The Minister rightly said that labels should be more informative and understandable to the public. I have two concerns. First, given the thrust of legislation, it seems to me as a consumer that a great deal of information is already being packed onto labels. Where will that end? I can almost imagine that a product will need a pamphlet attached to it to give all the information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is also a thrust towards stating on a label whether, for example, products are factory farmed, or whether pesticides are used, which will have an impact on British agriculture. What is the Government's policy on how much information should be put on a label and how it should be informative? If we flag up many of these extra matters, what will the impact be on British agriculture?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman in that, on some labels, the tiniest print is used. As he rightly says, if the matter is taken to ridiculous degrees, we could get to the ludicrous stage at which a leaflet has to be sent out with each product. That would be absolutely barmy and of no use to the consumer. It would merely appease the food faddies and those who take consumer interests as meaning flooding people with information but forgetting about the product. That is not practical and we are in the business of being practical. We need clear information on labels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office, there is very little information on nutrition in labelling by other member states. We do much more in this country and give a lead on it. Our input to the Commission is to improve the quality of labelling to make it simple as well as factual. We shall have the quantitative information directive fairly soon, at which point manufacturers will be required to state on the label the quantity of the main ingredient under which a product is sold, such as how much fish is in their fish cakes. If that turns out to be, say, 5 per cent., it might look a bit iffy. The quantity
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
of the main ingredient will have to be given so that the product is not missold. The percentage of vegetables in a spring roll was another example that I used earlier this year, along with that of cream crackers, in which there is no cream. We shall avoid having silly arguments about such things. The main ingredient is important and consumers are entitled to have useable information so that they can make an informed choice. That is crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We pushed the need for a review to increase information. With regard to genetically modified foods, it is not so much the production method as the ingredients in the food that are important, although under the beef labelling scheme that will come into force next year, it will be open to those who register for it to include in the labelling the sex and method of slaughter of the animal. Manufacturers can choose to do that, but they have to be registered to enter the scheme. We need practical and clear information that is presented as simply as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there are paradoxes and contradictions. The more information and the smaller the product, the smaller the print on the label will be. But we must find ways of making labelling clear and practical to the consumer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Humble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Minister that most consumers want intelligible information on labels. When I read them, they tend to tell me very little. What steps is my hon. Friend taking to find out from consumers the sort of information that they want on food labelling and how will he reproduce that in easily understandable, sensible and simple English?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clear English is how I would describe it. We have a consumer panel in the Department which meets regularly and lay representatives on all our independent scientific committees. I had discussions yesterday with representatives from the Consumers Association on aspects of labelling, especially for some of the more novel foods that we produce—those containing ingredients that were genetically modified at some time in parts of the food chain. It is a constant process. A fairly large section of the Department deals with the quality of labelling and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food produces information booklets in the "Food Sense" series. As I said, it is an on-going process, which will be handed over to the food standards agency because it will want to take a keen interest in the matter. We must have a practical system that is understandable and clear, as my hon. Friend said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Clark</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether My hon. Friend the Minister shares my concern that Conservative Members seemed to be suggesting that there would need to be a certain number of deaths before directives and legislation were considered. Is it recognised that there have been several food scares and that there is a perception among consumers that hygiene standards have fallen? Is not the issue of labelling and information one of rebuilding
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0089">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
consumers' confidence in food? Demands for labelling are due as much to the need to rebuild confidence as to the need to provide nutritional information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Commercial pressures are also involved; there is no question but that the big five supermarkets—the big food producers—have taken significant steps to improve their labelling. They have done so because they want to keep their customers and because it gives them a competitive edge—rightly so. If they can create a niche of better, clearer labelling, that is all to the good. Attention must also be paid to the proliferating food assurance schemes because if all food manufacturers have their own, that will place burdens on farmers and producers. We must develop a set of common standards in regard to the schemes that would assist the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of the matter—the need to be open and transparent and to implement the improvements—is one of restoring consumer confidence in British food. A crisis in one area—BSE is the obvious example—can have ramifications and knock-on effects throughout the food industry. People have become less confident about products and no longer believe Ministers' assurances about them. That is why we were committed to taking the matter out of Ministers' hands and to setting up an independent food standards agency, which will be the final link in restoring consumer confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that the vast majority of people buy food because they like it, not because of what is on the label? Very few people read the labels and when they do, they rarely understand what they mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: People do buy food because they like it, feel comfortable with it and believe it to be safe. However, if consumers wish to ask questions about food, it is important that they can get as much information as possible from the packaging. As I was told one day last week, a firm—I shall not mention it by name; it is one of the big five—that produces genetically modified tomato paste has much bigger sales of that paste than of the ordinary paste that uses fresh, wholesome tomatoes. People say that the genetically modified product tastes better; I asked the producers how that could be so when the same ingredient was used. They explained that genetically modified tomatoes stayed on the vine longer and tasted better. People are buying the paste because they know, from the labelling, that it uses genetically modified tomatoes. Two virtually identical products are available and people are choosing the one that uses genetically modified ingredients. They can make an informed choice. That is why labelling is needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Vis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: People do many things—some of which are illegal—because they like them; that does not mean that those things should necessarily be accepted. I agree with the Minister that food stores should not become like book stores, but I disagree with him about the reasons why people want labelling of genetically modified organisms. Many people are in fact scared of
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
those products. Will the Minister comment on separating in shops products that use such organisms from ones that do not, and on the question that the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) asked about the impact on British agriculture? What standards does the Minister believe that the agency should have in regard to labelling and separating British food? Is there anything that we can do to ensure that the labelling and separating standards for imported foods are the same as those used for home-produced foods?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks wide-ranging questions. The separation of products in shops will be a matter for shopkeepers, large or small. If they have, say, identical products which differ only in that some contain genetically modified organisms, they will probably put them close together in supermarkets, with shelves labelled clearly. That would be in shopkeepers' interests in that it would avoid complaints from customers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point about separation of ingredients—we are talking largely about soya and maize—I admit that there will be a problem. We are taking an active interest in this matter. We have been told that crop separation is difficult. Buyers of crops are not in a market position to insist on the Americans—the main suppliers—separating the crops, although, as I pointed out last week outside the House, some small niche market suppliers, especially suppliers of vegetarian foods, are. I am considering whether the Government, either alone or through the European Union, can do anything to assist the food industry across Europe to apply greater market pressure on the people from whom we buy genetically modified crops to separate them from other crops. That is an important consumer information point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On food labelling generally, any food imported to this country, from wherever it comes, has to meet our food safety requirements; if it does not, effectively, it is banned. I do not want to wake up each day thinking, "What can I ban?". However, there is a list of items one being pistachio nuts from Iran—on which we have identified a Europe-wide problem. We consider banning if a product does not meet our health requirements. We have to examine that aspect. If labelling is misleading and does not relate to a product, we have means of checking it. We buy thousands of products each year and have them checked to determine whether the ingredients are on the labels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bring the Minister's attention back to the Green Paper 8150/97, page 9, paragraph 4, which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the need to ensure an appropriate regulatory environment … conducive to innovation".</p></blockquote>
Can the Minister outline the proposals that he thinks meet that objective, as well as those that he thinks conflict with it? Will he, bearing in mind the innovatory nature of the British food industry, explain why innovation is not mentioned in his Department's response to the Green Paper?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will find the item that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. The Committee must remember that this is a Green Paper. One criticism of Green Papers—I have often criticised those published by the Government—is that they do not offer all the answers. It could be some years before the proposals in this paper become a directive or a regulation. We freely admit that the paper does not have all the answers. We submitted our views on it so as to have constructive dialogue with our partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding consumer choice, we are pushing for a seventh principle, not for the sake of it but because we wish to ensure that people have a choice of foods. This, by definition, would enable us to avoid difficulties with those of our trading partners who want to restrict certain products or not allow the single market to operate as it should by imposing restrictions on how products are made, and on ingredients. With that sort of restriction, there cannot be choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not offering all the answers. We are engaging in debate. We want a high standard of consumer protection and a science-based policy. It must be science based, but not necessarily exclusively so, in the sense that a judgment has to be made eventually. We want better enforcement, and we are pushing for reductions in barriers to trade. In that respect, the changes within the European Union are important. There are many barriers to trade within the alleged single market, as the right hon. Member for Fylde is aware. Better, more user-friendly regulation would overcome that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that the position will become clear only over time. It will take some time to reach agreement on the paper. We welcome that debate—it is one that we want to lead. We want to consider whether European laws meet the six principles that I decided not to read out in my opening statement. We want to consider the six principles, try to get the seventh principle accepted, and then ensure that our European partners check whether existing member state laws match those principles. That takes us back to one of the first questions asked by the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobbin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was glad to hear my hon. Friend the Minister refer to the Government's intention to set up an independent food safety agency—with the emphasis on the word "independent". That will obviously make a major contribution to food safety in this country and to the development of food safety in Europe. Can my hon. Friend tell us what progress has been made in setting up that agency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. We will publish a White Paper shortly—in the time-honoured phrase—setting out the framework for the food standards agency. It will be published either shortly before or shortly after Christmas—it makes sense not to publish it on a bank holiday. There will be a consultation period of at least eight weeks or a couple of months, and probably longer if we can arrange that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contrary to press reports, there have been no turf wars in Whitehall. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Health have had a common approach and have worked in
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
tandem. We have put forward proposals to ensure that Professor James's report is implemented in a practical manner. We have followed the principle that the food agency will go from plough to plate. It will have the necessary powers to act right through the food chain. The Ministry has no problem with giving up all of its vested interests, as it were, in respect of food surveillance and checking. Those responsibilities will pass to an independent agency by the middle of 1999, once legislation has been passed by the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper will have green edges. We have made it clear that we want to consult. We will then produce a draft Bill in the late spring or early summer, so that the House can be part of the consultation process. The Bill will represent a radical change in the machinery of government concerning how food is dealt with in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: According to the second report of the Select Committee on European Legislation, the Commission communication on consumer health and food safety.
	<br><blockquote><p>"suggests the expansion of the role of the Commission's Control Service to include monitoring of food quality."</p></blockquote>
What are the Minister's views on food quality? For example, does he believe that the definition of food quality is a matter for either this Parliament or the European Commission? If so, will he tell us what he understands by the word "quality", and why food quality should be included in the consumer health and food safety remit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good question. When we talk about safe food and safer food, we must be careful about the words that we use. We have food safety legislation that places a duty on the food industry to ensure that the food it sells is not injurious to health, unfit for human consumption or so contaminated that a reasonable person would not be expected to eat it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked specifically about the consumer health and food safety remit. The food control section of the Commission, that has been transferred to DGXXIV will continue to monitor national authorities and their enforcement of food standard rules. Co-ordination is important and we are content with the Commission's decision to make such work the responsibility of that Directorate-General. Inspectors visit this country regularly as they do other member states and we must not think that we are the only country where inspectors inspect the quality of food and make inquiries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I am trying to make to the Minister is that food quality is a subjective matter about which we, as individual consumers, decide. Is he saying that politicians or officials in Departments should prescribe to the public what is quality food and what is not? Should not such matters be left to individuals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly; we have enough to do checking whether food is safe and the labelling is accurate. Quality is a matter of consumer taste. That is the definition; it is not something about which we can make a regulation or on which we can legislate. We do
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
not attempt to do that, nor do we approve of others trying to do it. We must enforce existing rules that are designed to protect the safety of food throughout the chain. Sometimes the words "quality" and "safety" are interchangeable and that is inaccurate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Best</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter that we are discussing is one not of regulation, under-regulation or over-regulation, but of educating the consumer. About a year ago, my local fish and chip shop displayed a notice stating, "Never a case of food poisoning in 100 years". Does my hon. Friend agree that the important lesson to learn from that is that the gap between cooking and consumption is crucial? If food is cooked when it is fresh and consumed within a short time, the chances of problems arising are minimal. If we regard the process of education as important as regulation, we might reduce the number of deaths from food poisoning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made a good point, but I suspect that the chip shop could not go to court with a guarantee that such a statement was absolutely true. A notice saying that there had been no complaint of food poisoning in 100 years would probably be more likely to be one that the shop could sustain before my learned friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was right about education. We live in a convenience society. People rely on fast foods; they do not cook and preserve food so much as they used to do, nor do they eat enough fresh food. The last thing that the Government would want to do, and the last thing that the food agency would be allowed to do, is to tell people what to eat. However, we shall always advise people to eat more fresh vegetables and fresh fruit and to have a balanced diet. That is good public health advice, not just advice from a "foodie".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am keen that people are educated about the food chain. However, many people are not too interested in the beginning of the chain—from the meat end, for example. They like the food package and what they buy from the butcher's shop, but they are not too interested to learn about how the food was processed before it reached the shop. They just need to know that the regulatory authorities have made sure that the food is safe. I shall certainly supply my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West (Mr. Best) and other members of the Committee with details of the educational tools on food produced by the Department of Health and MAFF.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a large programme of educational packages for schools, including that from the British Nutrition Foundation. Those packages do not push a line or push products, but push information about food technology, diet and health. The packs are available at about £60 each to schools that have the cash. They are excellent value for money. MAFF has put a lot of money into that programme. I paid tribute to it when it was launched by the previous Government—it did not start in May. It has cost well over £1 million over the past few years to help educate the younger generation, through the national curriculum, about all aspects of food.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have come to scrutinise the Green Paper. Can the Minister say what practical difficulties the proposals in the Green Paper would have made to the severity of the outbreak of E. coli in Scotland? He said earlier that he was satisfied that the European Union has adequate resources, but it is more a question of resources being available to make inspections at the point of sale—in food outlets—to the consumer. Is he satisfied that, in a national context, those resources are adequate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Lady to the Committee. She makes an important point. Enforcement at the retail end, which is where the problem occured in Scotland, is a matter for local authorities. In England, about 300 local authorities act as enforcement agencies. They all do their best, but some are very large and some are quite tiny and not all devote the same resources to the problem. Sometimes, it is treated as a specialist matter; sometimes it is dealt with by trading standards or environmental health officers, who work on matters other than food safety. Only some authorities have food specialists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the areas of work that we shall be discussing when the White Paper is published is the role of the food standards agency. Its remit should be to ensure that all local authority areas, whether large or small, have the same quality of inspection and enforcement. For instance, variations may occur between local authorities that come across a problem that they believe should go to court. Such cases can eat up an enormous part of local authorities' budgets. I heard of a recent case that had cost a small metropolitan authority £250,000. We do not want small local authorities saying that such problems are too big for them to deal with, turning a blind eye and letting another authority deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the food standards agency's role will be to ensure that such problems do not arise. It should ensure proper enforcement throughout the country. In Scotland, where it will be a matter for the Scottish arm of the agency, food safety is dealt with by the health department as opposed to the agriculture department. Those departments unite in the Scottish Office, so there is a degree of co-ordination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that local authorities make sufficient money available. We do not want to impose a blanket, prescriptive role, telling local authorities exactly what to do, but we must ensure that there are common standards and that we can monitor the outcome of local authority inspections. It would be quite unacceptable if local authorities were to take short cuts because of a lack of resources or because they had decided to put those resources into other priorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In terms of the small-scale producer—I have in mind a producer of kippers in my constituency, the Whitby Kipper Man, who runs a two-man business—under directive 79/112, he can sell his kippers only from his shop. He cannot distribute them nationwide because he cannot meet all the requirements for labelling. I know of a gentleman who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
travels all the way from Wakefield to Whitby every day—a round trip of about 150 miles—to collect his Whitby kippers. What assistance will be made available across the Community, and particularly to people in my constituency, to enable small suppliers to meet the labelling requirements that are intended to minimise risk to consumers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been said, consumers will go to great lengths to get what they fancy and what they feel is good for them. They will not be too bothered about all this if they think that a Whitby kipper is a good thing to eat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I add a figure to my previous answers? I remind the Committee that in the late summer, before the end of the recess, the Department of Health announced an extra £90 million to assist local authorities in enforcing the regulations arising from the Pennington report—those regulations will be finalised soon. This is not a simple matter on which to legislate; it is a serious and complex issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to my hon. Friend's plug for his local Whitby kippers, suppliers of niche products and other small producers who use the post must conform to the same regulations as everyone else. We cannot exempt suppliers from food safety regulations. Many suppliers have shown that they can conform, although I accept that many will not be able to do so. In a niche market, suppliers should be able to satisfy conditions—it is up to them. There is no reason for saying that a firm should be exempt from labelling laws because it is small and because someone travels 150 miles a day to buy kippers. That would be unacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not know, which is a real problem. Because we do not know, we have to operate on the precautionary principle: let us be overcautious in some areas, because we are not certain. It is a great difficulty. As a result of all the checks that have been carried out, salmonella in the chicken flock, for example, has vastly reduced in recent years. The incidence is now about 30 per cent.; it was once way above 50 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
We know about food poisoning cases only when people report them to their general practitioners or when many people are affected, such as at a reception or where people have clearly been in one particular location. These days people report cases more often. That is not to excuse rising figures, but the hon. Gentleman has hit on a matter that is of concern. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Health are constantly looking for links, to identify the risks and introduce the necessary enforcement rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing on which I could be criticised is our recent decision to consult on whether people should be able to drink raw milk in England and Wales—people in Scotland cannot do that—as there is a perceived risk of food poisoning and pathogens.

I am grateful to the Minister for committing the Government to publishing a detailed list of those parts of European food legislation that are defective and to give, in the interests of openness and transparency, the reasons why he supports either their amendment or their removal. Will he be kind enough to tell us what time scale he is prepared to put on that exercise? I have often seen official documents that contain a general commitment which, at the end of the day, means nothing because no timetable is put on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members' questions have elicited a clear perspective on this matter: whatever anyone says and however much science is applied, there is still a certain amount of feeling around in the dark, in that there is no definitive scientific analysis at European level to pin down some of the risk factors that affect the food supply. For example, the bacteriological contamination is known about, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) said, there is no definitive analysis of the sources of food poisoning, as the Minister has admitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be interesting to know the Minister's reaction to a recent article in the 
	<i>British Medical Journal</i> which stated that, against a background over the past 20 years of increasing legislation to deal with food poisoning, the number of cases has inexorably increased. It would be interesting to know whether what has happened in the United Kingdom is mirrored in the rest of Europe. That is a defining factor affecting some of the matters contained in the Green Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to press the Minister on an overall theme which ran throughout several of the questions that the Commission posed in the Green Paper on food law. Several questions were asked about the Commission's competency. I should be grateful if the Minister could definitively state on which matters in the Green Paper the Commission has asked for increased powers of competency. Does he agree with the Commission's views, or can the Government give us no answers because this is a Green Paper and so this too early and the matter too complicated? The Minister has produced a rather thin document in reply. He should have considered such matters and have been able to give the Committee some guidance on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in the comments of Labour Members on the question of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are mentioned in the section on innovation to which I drew the Minister's attention. Unfortunately, the Minister did not satisfactorily answer my question; perhaps he will reflect on my remarks and write to me in due course. Will the Minister assure us that throughout the process of consultation on the Green Paper he will press the Commission for an undertaking that if food law is to be changed, a full and thorough costs-compliance exercise will be carried out for each new proposal? Paragraph 3.1(3) of the document deals with the promotion of product quality policy at Community level. Will the subject of agriculture spill over into the discussions on Agenda 2000?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested by the Minister's comment that there is no definition of safe food. That term is used in paragraph 2, on page 12, of the document. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Minister was right to draw the Committee's attention to some of the dangers in regard to descriptions. He mentioned cream crackers; another problem is what we mean by "fresh". Achieving such a definition is vital—at present, the word means many different things to different people. The Green Paper makes other attempts to define terms, such as "wholesomeness"—I should be interested to know what the Minister thinks that means—and the Commission has elsewhere attempted to define foods that are mentioned in the Green Paper. Why should we not have definitions that help us understand more clearly the precise meaning of safe food? We can recognise the reverse—when food is unsafe—but we need to be able to recognise safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister outline the proposals that he believes meet the objective in paragraph 4, on page 9, of the Green Paper to ensure "an appropriate regulatory environment" that is conducive to innovation? I am sorry to return to that subject, but it is important, bearing in mind that it is touched on in several places in the Green Paper. It is no use the Minister falling back on the argument that he cannot answer questions about a Green Paper; I should like to know his opinion. His Department must have an opinion of everything in the Green Paper or he could not have written his Deputy's reply to it. If he is not able now to give me chapter and verse on the matter, may I take him up on his kind offer to write to me?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An interesting point in the document is the need for a directive to deal with foods for athletes. There are products that claim to have remarkable properties that if only one bottle or can is drunk, it will confer on even me Olympic status for a brief moment—and I accept that that may require labelling. Other members of the Committee have spoken at length on that. However, is there a proposal to go beyond that and to issue specific advice? The issuing of a directive, which is a heavyweight piece of Commission work, on food for athletes will terrify some people that similar directives will be issued for food for pensioners, for disabled people, and finally for us all. We do not know where it will stop. Will the Minister clarify that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be interested to explore with the Minister how the proposals in the Green Paper deal with a very important subject—differences in scientific opinion. The hon. Gentleman briefly mentioned BSE. I shall not trespass on that subject now, but it is clear that there are differences in scientific opinion between United Kingdom scientists, who fundamentally believe that what we are doing has made UK-produced beef safe, in scientific terms, for human consumption, and the reluctance of scientists in Europe to endorse that advice. How will the new arrangements with reference to DGXXIV and the proposals in the Green Paper assist the resolution of scientific advice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems for food consumers is the conflicting information about what is supposed to be safe food. Last year's announcement, which I liked, was that two glasses of red wine a day was good for my health. I understand that there is scientific justification for that because of the anti-oxident content. However, not all that long ago drinkers of red wine were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
confronted with the different message that consumption at a certain level could have an adverse effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the proposals in the Green Paper help resolve the ever-shifting ground in which advice on food is given? No amount of wonderful labelling and information will be any good if scientists continue to put forward all sorts of conflicting advice. If there is one role for a Europeanwide view, it should be on what is safe or unsafe food. It would be interesting if the Minister would say how his own difficulties over vitamin B6 might have been handled by some of the new proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of my concern is touched on in paragraph 9 of the Minister's response to the Select Committee on European Legislation. He says that he knows of no problems resulting from the lack of harmonisation on processing aids, but that he still thinks that it should be reviewed. Why does he think that there are no problems, but that the matter should be reviewed? That brings me to the general sloppiness of language in MAFF's response to the Green Paper. I draw the Minister's attention to paragraph 12, which comments on section 3. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The UK would agree that greater use could be made of Regulations".</p></blockquote>
Does he not have a more definite view on the subject? The phrase "could be made" is rather uncertain. There is also an element of uncertainty in paragraph 13 of the Minister's reply when referring to updating legislation, when he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This may be a useful precedent".</p></blockquote>
It either is or is not useful. There is another example of the sloppy use of the language in paragraph 15, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While we have no significant problem with the definition of `foodstuffs' in paragraph 5.1, we wonder whether the perceived need that it addresses is more important than the problems it creates."</p></blockquote>
I love the sense of wonderment. We can imagine officials walking in one day and saying, "We wonder if there is something that we should be doing", and the Minister being happy to send out his wonderment in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want an undertaking from the Minister that he will go through the document, toughen up his response and give us a definitive view of what the Government believe they should or should not be doing. Indistinct, waffley language gives so much room for manoeuvre. The hon. Gentleman told us that he wants to be open and transparent, so it would help to have some clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister give us a more definitive view on the very interesting subject taken up in the Green Paper on the need to make more use of regulations rather than directives? Will he firm up his own position on that subject? In his reply, the Minister says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The UK would agree that greater use could be made of Regulations"—</p></blockquote>
but he does not tell us that it should be done. Will he give us a clear statement on that point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
We have discussed labelling and one of the most important points that came up was the question of the consumers' position. Will the Commission—in the guise of the Green Paper—carry out a definitive analysis of what consumers pick up from labels? Do consumers read and understand them, or is there a terminology problem? No amount of wonderful scientific activity will overcome consumers' lack of appreciation of the information on labels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point about scientific advice, the Minister spoke of improvements in the category of persons appointed to scientific committees. A great deal of practical guidance on science comes from people in the world of work, at the level of food manufacturers or processors. If there is not to be a conflict of interest, how will the problem be resolved, and will there be full opportunity for practical experts to have their say under the new arrangements outlined by the Minister?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister happy with the way in which the Commission has proposed to review its role in alerting the public to food risks? I am not sure from the Green Paper how the Commission will operate: usually the Government of a member state initially become aware of a problem. Will some of this work be sub-contracted to the Commission?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Minister to paragraph 6, page 29 of the Green Paper. Do the Government support the idea of Community legislation covering the hygiene of products of non-animal origin at the primary agricultural production stage? Does the Minister think that this can be covered by general rules applicable to foodstuffs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister recognised the importance of science in food safety. Can he tell the Committee how the Government view the Commission's proposed approach of using the precautionary principle to determine policy in the absence of a clear scientific opinion? The Minister kept wandering into this area when he spoke. However, some would regard the idea as quite dangerous, because the precautionary principle begs questions of accountability. Clear directives and regulations laying down the terms under which the Commission can, and cannot, act on behalf of member states is one thing. The precautionary principle allows a large margin for judgment. This should be explored with care, and in considerable detail, which is why I asked earlier about Commission competency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I agree with the Minister's response to section 7 of the Green Paper relating to safety and wholesomeness, I should like him to explain the meaning of the term. Does he think that a definition of wholesomeness should be decided nationally, or by the Commission? Will he say something about external relations? Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have spoken about foodstuffs coming into the Community. We have heard little about how the Minister expects the Green Paper's proposals to stack up against the work being undertaken under the Codex negotiations; about whether there might be a conflict of interest; or about whether the proposals will facilitate a smooth control of food coming from non-EU sources. If Codex should in any way fall below the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
standard proposed by the Commission, there will be a huge gaping hole in food safety protection. Therefore, Codex and the Green Paper should be properly aligned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Minister's response to section 8 of the document, he seemed to be fence sitting. Does he agree in principle with the application of product liability to the primary agriculture sector? Can he expand on the consequent level of cost compliance for primary agriculture? I realise that I have asked many questions, but my doing so merely reflects the Minister's admission that the Green Paper covers a lot of ground. It is incumbent on the hon. Gentleman, in pursuit of his proper observations on openness and transparency, to publish a supplement to his reply, fleshing out precisely where the Government are going, and to make certain that the House is kept fully informed about the development of policy at each and every stage. Too much work at European level is undertaken by the management committee structure. We in the House of Commons never get sight of such committee's discussions. In the pursuit of openness and transparency, let us hope that the Minister will keep the House fully informed of progress in this most important area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Rudi Vis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley and Golders Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was educated by what my hon. Friend the Minister had to say. I appreciate the honesty and brevity of his answers. After all, we are discussing a Green Paper. If the Green Paper had been prescriptive, we would have had major complaints about it; instead, it is part and parcel of a process for reaching conclusions at a later stage which is a good thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with what the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) said about waffle. As the motion says, the Government intend
	<br><blockquote><p>"to support and contribute to the development of an EC food policy"—</p></blockquote>
I am not sure why it says "EC food policy"; it should be "EU food policy"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"which delivers high standards of food safety".</p></blockquote>
That is why the Government propose to set up the food standards agency. As the Minister explained, the matter is extraordinarily complicated. The Government's proposals for an independent agency are radical and comprehensive and require co-operation between the Minister and the Minister for Public Health, as well as other colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree most with the last two comments made by the right hon. Member for Fylde. First, he argued that in research, specialists disagree. Of course specialists disagree, for a number of reasons. Some specialists consider the matter from the consumer's point of view; others consider it from the producer's point of view. We have heard from an enormous number of specialists from the producers' side; we are now hearing from specialists who have the interests of consumer protection much more in mind. People disagree because an enormous amount of money is
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
involved in the food industry—in production, consumption and everything in between. There is a fight for resources here, as there is everywhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the right hon. Gentleman confronts us with the notion of science and scientific research. My hon. Friend the Minister has made it clear that much of what is involved is not science but an understanding of words—linguistics, which is social science. There are always battles in social science. If the Minister had responded with definitions of words such as "taste", "preference", "wholesomeness" and "freshness", every word would be attacked, because such words fall outside scientific definition. He has not done so, and he is being lambasted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister has made it clear several times that we are moving away from being merely producer-orientated—as we have been for the past 18 years—to become consumer protection-orientated, and rightly so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Dr. Vis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am perfectly aware of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point concerns food labelling. We can conceptually compare food labelling with what has occurred, for example, in car safety. Everyone would agree that we are in the business of making cars safe. As I understand it, my hon. Friend the Minister has said that he is interested in food safety. I thank him for being so honest about his position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a most interesting debate, which has revealed some amazing facts. First, there has been a major increase in food poisoning, but we do not know why. That has come about despite the huge investment of money, people and Government effort in the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was particularly touched by the mention of the Whitby kippers and the fish and chip shop. The Green Paper is heading in absolutely the wrong direction. Surely it is up to the producers to stand by their products, proudly putting labels on the shop doors, as the fish and chip man had done. When people go to a chip shop or restaurant, they are interested in the food, not the law. Yet the first paragraph of the Green Paper, which is headed "General Background", states:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Food law is a matter of great public concern." I do not think that it is. No one has ever written to me about food law; the public are worried about the safety of food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I talked yesterday to a food expert who told me that there had been 1,000 cases of E. coli so far this year, with a death rate of approximately 10 per cent. That is dreadful. The hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Clark) hinted that the Opposition were looking for a ghastly score card before action was taken, but that would be reprehensible. That is not what we are getting at. I am worried that we are continuing to build
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
up a massive system which does not work. The Minister honestly said that he did not know why food poisoning was on the increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider two other industries—aircraft and lift manufacturing. The aircraft industry undertakes exhaustive research into critical failures. It is carried out by the manufacturers themselves, who are accountable to a regulatory body. Under our lift regulations, lifts are tested by private companies, who issue a certificate. The insurance of a building with a lift without a certificate is invalid and the owner of the building is bounced by the authorities. That is what puts the onus on them. We hear of few cases of lift accidents in this country because the lift regulations are effectively run by the private insurance industry. That runs counter to what happens in the food industry. The Government make more and more regulations without making is clear who will enforce them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some analysis must be made of where things have gone wrong. It is extraordinary that we do not know the reasons for the increase in food poisoning. There seems to be a complete misinterpretation of the hazard analysis critical control point system—the HACCP system. That system was devised by the Americans. Having devoted a very large slice of their gross domestic product to getting people to the moon, they wanted to ensure that they did not suffer the national humiliation of astronauts going down with Montezuma's revenge on the way there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system was developed by the US Army laboratory—the Pillsdown Corporation, one of the largest food corporations in the United States—and it focused on the necessity of analysing those critical places where, if something went wrong, food poisoning would inevitably follow. The intention was to analyse not possibilities but absolute cast-iron certainties that if certain procedures were not correctly followed, food poisoning would result. The Green Paper has misinterpreted that. On page 28, especially in section 1, it shows a very broad-brush approach. I must emphasise that that is not what HACCP is about. HACCP is about analysing the critical point—possibly just one operation. The Green Paper talks about the broad analysis of all operations, but I assure the Committee that that cannot work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the John Barr case. He had been investigated twice in the weeks before the outbreak by the environmental health agency. There were two other failures in 1995, one in Sunderland and one in Warwick. It was a failure of enforcement, not a failure of law. We have enough law to ensure that John Barr cases should not come about, but on that occasion it was not properly enforced. The procedures were sloppy. The Pennington report did not pin down the cause precisely, but it seems that the likely reason for the outbreak was cross-contamination of cooked and uncooked meats. That is what the HACCP system aims to deal with. Barr was breaking the basic rules,
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
mixing personnel, utensils, knives and refrigerators and handling together the two materials—cooked and uncooked meat—that must never come into contact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that we are going in the wrong direction. It is not clear who will police the Green Paper's recommendations. I come back to my earlier remark: the onus should be on the producer, which is the opposite of what the Minister said. The producer should stand by his product and should be jumped on with a proverbial ton of bricks if things go wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the analysis as far back as the Robens report into health and safety at work. Lord Robens identified two approaches. The first was that the producer be given the freedom and responsibility to operate factories and produce goods safely, so that, if regulations were contravened and people were injured, the producer must pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second approach was prescriptive, and I fear that that is what we have here. People are told exactly what to do and how to do it. A fortune is spent on extra regulatory bodies and people do not have the time to concentrate on the matter in hand—providing safe food in a fish and chip shop, for example. They have to fill in forms, welcome the environmental health officer on time, give the veterinary surgeon a cup of tea and so on. That is where we are going wrong. People are concentrating too much on fulfilling the requirements of the regulations and not on the real issue—the provision of safe food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that we are having this debate. I do not like the direction in which the Green Paper is taking us, which has failed over the past 40 years. Despite spending more and more money, there has been an incease in food poisoning, as the Minister said. I hope that, in his reply, he will assure us that he will consider a different form of regulation, such as the one that prevails in the lift industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Norfolk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friends, I am concerned about the general sloppiness of much of the material that has been presented to the Committee, not only today but on previous occasions. I hasten to say that the sloppiness is not entirely that of Ministers; it arises from the way in which European legislation—even a green Paper—is drafted and presented, as we have seen today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am critical of the Minister and his officials in one respect. To use the late Dean Acheson's expression, the difference between academia—in which class I would place officials—and government is that in academic and civil service circles one often argues things to a conclusion, whereas in government one must argue things to a decision. That is what government is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some understanding and appreciation of the problems that the Minister faces, but all he has said today is, "On the one hand", "On the other hand" and "It's all rather difficult". We recognise that it is all rather difficult but, in the words of Lady Thatcher, we are not in the business of continually recycling problems, we are in the business of finding solutions
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
and making decisions. When the Minister appears before us again to discuss other related matters, I urge him to come up with some hard solutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention has been made of newspaper reports on the food standards agency. We are talking about food law, health and standards, so it would help the Committee if the Minister could confirm or deny whether his right hon. Friend the Minister without Portfolio has initiated a paper from his office relating to the food standards agency. Has he asked whether nutritional aspects would be included in such a paper? Such information would genuinely clear the air.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that there are two aspects of the green paper which we have only marginally discussed. First, the green paper explicitly excludes the Commission's new approach to scientific advice and control involving the separation of responsibilities. What impact will that have on food safety?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde has said, the green paper does not mention the transfer of responsibility for food safety to the consumer affairs directorate. That will make a considerable difference to the regulations and to the extent to which the Commission becomes involved in their enforcement. What has the Minister to say about that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire on putting his finger on a central issue: it is not that the Government and the Opposition are somehow divided, with the Government representing consumers and the Opposition representing the producers, but that we should all be concerned about food safety and about putting the onus of responsibility where it will achieve the desired effect. I always think that, if lawyers and the law are called in, not only are costs high but a clear conclusion is not reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Joan Humble 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, North and Fleetwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the systematic approach to food law that the green paper represents. I was fascinated to read pages 41 to 43 and the list of gruesome descriptions of the different diseases and infections that might be transmitted from animals to man. That list underpins the reasons why we must carefully consider food hygiene and regulation. As a consumer, I am worried about the sort of food that I buy and whether it is safe to eat. I should like personal reassurance about that, which I can then give to others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware that consumers are pushing in different directions. Consumers are increasingly asked for organic food because of concerns about the chemical additives, herbicides and pesticides used in production. Equally, consumers are now much more vocal about the welfare of farm animals. They want inexpensive meat, but they also want animals to be reared and cared for less intensively. Consumers want food labelling to be clear. They are worried about new issues, such as genetically modified organisms. They want to know what they are eating and how it will affect them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
However, we are talking not just about consumers. I agree with the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk in that we are all concerned about the industry. Farmers are concerned because they know that there is increasing public concern about the care of farm animals, and farmers want to respond positively to that, as do manufacturers. Food manufacturers in my constituency are not worried about regulations which enable them to produce the food that they want to produce and offer reassurance to retailers and customers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby is not here because I want to plug Fleetwood fish as well as Whitby kippers. In recent years, the fish producers of Fleetwood have built up a reputation for high-quality products, which they sell not only in this country but abroad. They would be pleased if the regulations that they abide by reassured customers in this country and those abroad. I do not see two conflicting aspects in food law; we should all work together. Fleetwood fish is good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree that part of the success of Fleetwood is due to the work of the previous Government, who provided substantial funding for the rebuilding and refurbishment of the Fleetwood fish market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Humble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is well aware that Fleetwood fish market received contributions from various scources to develop what is an excellent auction market. Many ancillary businesses nearby rely on the high-quality fish caught by Fleetwood fishermen, and on the regulations that control them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agreed with my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West when he referred to education, which is important because people's lifestyles are changing and we receive conflicting information about food. We are told that we should eat healthily. However, we are not sure what healthy eating means, given that one week we are told that red wine is good for us, while the next week we are told that it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As consumers, we should receive more clear advice on what is meant by healthy eating. We also need more advice about simple issues, such as food storage and preparation. Part of that is a matter of labelling, but it links in with what our children are taught at school. Earlier, my hon. Friend the Minister said that MAFF spent a substantial amount on providing resources for schools. However, my two daughters, who have just completed statutory schooling and are now in higher and further education establishments, learnt little at school about cooking, food preparation or where food came from, compared with what I learnt in my domestic science lessons. I have had to teach my daughters aspects of food preparation that they were not taught at school. I hope that schools will take advantage of the information that is available and that children will learn about basic matters such as food storage, food hygiene and cooking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that children now prefer to eat at hamburger restaurants and live the American lifestyle of snacking. They do not seem to be interested in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
cooking of food and where it comes from. The debate about food poisoning, therefore, applies not only to food manufacturers and shops, but to what is happening in the home. I am not sure what my hon. Friend the Minister can do about that, but the matter needs to be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I welcome many of the proposals that we are discussing, it is important for my hon. Friend the Minister to confirm that the Government are working hard and offering supervision and advice about food safety, and that they are not sitting back doing nothing, waiting for the proposals in the document to coalesce into something meaningful. The proposals for the independent food standards agency reflect much of the good work that is already taking place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Gill 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should preface my remarks by reminding members of the Committee of the interest that I have declared in the Register of Members' Interests. The great success of the British food industry is evidenced by the age profile of our population. Our life expectancy is greater than ever before and, general speaking, our health is better than ever before. I believe that that has much to do with our diet and the safety of the food that we consume.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one nugget of common sense—one to which we should all adhere—that emerges from the debate is the comment of the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West that, in the long run, education would be more effective than legislation. I endorse that sentiment. My hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire pointed out that the first words of the executive summary of the Green Paper referred to food law as a matter of great public concern. He went on, rightly, to say that the public were concerned not about food law, but about food safety. We are in danger of looking through the wrong end of the telescope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire and my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde instanced the increase in the number of cases of food poisoning, at a time when we have more food legislation, and possibly more inspectors, than ever before. The Minister said that he did not know the cause of that increase; I am sure that all members of the Committee sympathise with him on that. It is a conundrum. However, the Minister, as the person responsible, must look harder and in greater depth at the authorities' activities—are they being truly professional and effective in the way in which they identify and isolate the risks? That returns us to the important matters of surveillance, which should pinpoint the highest risks, and of enforcement of appropriate action. Many food safety problems stem not from inadequacies in the law, but from failures of enforcement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recall the "World in Action" programme on the St. Merrion meat company? It was evident that that company had major quality controls that were thwarted by the actions of
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
individuals and management who, for various reasons, decided to ignore their own procedures. That illustrates the importance of the individual, who can subvert the codes of practice and regulations that are designed to prevent such breaches of quality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a lifetime's experience in the meat industry, and I was embarrassed by that programme. There is no reason to doubt that what the camera recorded happended, and it was unsatisfactory. However, the Minister needs to be careful that, in trying to achieve higher standards of food safety, he does not push out of business the smaller companies that take pride in their products, thereby driving trade into the hands of the bigger companies to which my right hon. Friend has just alluded. That would create a far greater risk for the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Vis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman comment on education? He said that he was embarrassed about the activities shown on the "World in Action" programme; he must also have been embarrassed because the law had not been enforced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the point that came out in the programme. There had been a breakdown in education within the company, to the extent that the employees, and their supervisors, did not understand the risks that they were taking. The legislation is in place and inspectors have the power to enter any premises to ensure that it is implemented. However, employees and the public must understand that food is potentially a hazardous product—and we must understand that the risks can be understand only through education, not through legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Best</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Pehaps I should expand on what I said earlier about education being required. I want to make it plain to all concerned that I support the improvement of regulation and I support the improvements that will come from legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is sometimes a misunderstanding about the difference between training and education. We can be trained to do certain things, but to be educated is qualitatively different—someone who is educated will understand the rationale for doing those things. We can train monkeys to do things, but they do not understand the necessity to comply fully with procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The weight of legislation is driving the food industry into bigger and bigger units, in which the labour force is effectively deskilled. Gone are the days when one man could do every job associated with producing a piece of meat for a family to eat on Sunday. Now, several people—perhaps hundreds of people—play a tiny part in the process. The whole operation has been deskilled, and the more legislation there is, the more it will continue to be deskilled, resulting in all the hazards to which the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West has drawn the Committee's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to my analogy of looking through the wrong end of the telescope. Apart from the fact that the Minister and the Government generally must
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
consider the efficacy of the current inspectorate and enforcement authorities, we must never repeat what has happened before when, in the absence of anything satisfactory to do, Governments have decided to institute massive slaughter policies and to blame the animal kingdom for human failure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to accept that to eliminate salmonella, for example, by June last year we had to slaughter 3.75 million head of poultry. In the same way, according to today's "Farming Today" programme, the total number of cattle slaughtered under the BSE regulations has now reached 1.85 million. That is unacceptable and we must never go down that route again; we must look harder at what we human beings have done, or failed to do, to provide people with safe food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about the importance of having independent, competent and transparent scientific advice, and I am sure that the whole Committee would endorse that. However, there are hazards involved there, too. If we are to rely on scientific advice to determine whether a food product is safe, the problem is that no scientist will ever say categorically that anything is 100 per cent. safe. So the question is left hanging, and the public say, "Why, Minister, don't you tell us that it is 100 per cent. safe?" I appreciate the Minister's predicament, which was shared by his predecessors, as he will never find anyone to say, hand on heart and based on scientific findings, that a product is 100 per cent. safe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's other problem is finding scientists who have the relevant practical knowledge and experience. It is easy when setting up committees of inquiry to find scientists who have knowledge, but much more difficult to recruit the scientist who has the practical knowledge and experience of the commodity in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a scientific committee has investigated a matter, as happened with BSE, and then it is found that that committee was barking up the wrong tree, would it not be extremely difficult for that committee to admit that it had got it wrong and that the answer lay elsewhere? I must declare a small interest here, because I am not absolutely persuaded that the cause of BSE is what has been ascribed over several years. Other theories might ultimately demonstrate that we were barking up the wrong tree. The Minister has the problem of attempting to discern whether the scientific committees will continue to cling to the advice that they gave over several years, rather than admit to making a mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second report of the Select Committee on European Legislation states that one of the Commission's aims is,
	<br><blockquote><p>"to enable the Commission to propose appropriate measures for the future development of Community food law, where necessary."</p></blockquote>
I urge the Minister to consider this matter carefully, to ensure that legislation is laid only where strictly necessary, and wherever possible to avoid it and go down the route—graphically described by his hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West—of education rather than legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
The report also refers to the requirement,
	<br><blockquote><p>"to place the primary responsibility for safe food on industry"—</p></blockquote>
among others, a point alluded to by my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire. That is wholly right. In any other industry, the manufacturer and retailer of a product would be responsible. I cannot think of any other industry that bears as heavy a burden of legislation and inspection rules as the food industry currently does. It is important that we resist the route of ever more legislation and pin responsibility on to the industry itself, which is more than happy to take it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reluctant to intervene, as I intended to speak in a little while, but am I to understand that, in terms of the industry's liabilty, the hon. Gentleman thinks that the beef industry should pay the cost of BSE?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must understand that it was not the beef industry but the politicians who created the circumstances in which the industry now finds itself. In my view, the incidence of BSE had less—perhaps nothing—to do with science and everything to do with politics. It was a political decision, made in Europe, and it was tremendously damaging to the beef industry. Those circumstances fully justify the Government's attempts to try to alleviate hardship in the industry wherever they can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take pride in the fact that in former incarnation as a member of the council of the British Meat Manufacturers Association I initiated the practice of self-regulation, which the industry adopted. That is the sensible way to proceed. Wherever possible, the Government should encourage the industry, or any section of it, to institute self-regulation, because that sort of regulation will be understood and will be related to the problems that the industry understands far better than civil servants, Ministers or politicians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 1.17 refers to Ministers being
	<br><blockquote><p>"directly responsible to their Parliaments".</p></blockquote>
When the Minister replies, I hope that he will confirm that he recognises the importance of the close link between Ministers and this Parliament. Nothing done by way of a follow-up to the Green Paper should detract from the fact that Ministers are answerable to our Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has emphasised that there is no such thing as zero risk. It is rash of politicians to hold out to the public the prospect that everything will be risk free. In an imperfect world, that is not possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I questioned the Minister about food quality, and specifically why it should be included in the consumer health and food safety remit. The Minister did not quite answer that point. The danger is that if we include quality and nutrition in further legislation, the law will be far too prescriptive and we will have entered the huge minefield so ably described by the hon. Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson). We should avoid that. My hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire said that the law should be upheld and that those who break it should have the book
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
thrown at them. We should not make the law so prescriptive that it becomes a benefit match for lawyers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.31 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will do my best to respond to the debate. I shall answer hon. Members in reverse order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should go without challenge that the Government consider themselves accountable first and foremost to the House of Commons. I hope that, by our actions since 1 May, we have shown that we are prepared to be open and transparent when answering parliamentary questions and when discussing policy options. So far, no one has accused me, my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or my other ministerial colleagues of not being different to our predecessors. We wish to change the ethos of the Ministry and to make it open, transparent and consumer orientated. Above all else, we want to be sure that we make information fully available to the House. That will continue to be our practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not mean to sound derogatory or pompous, but when I walk into the Ministry each day, I enter as a Member of Parliament. Once through the door, I am a Minister and one of a team, but outside it I am accountable to the House of Commons. That is a key factor in how I and my right hon. and hon. Friends operate. We will take every possible step, sometimes at the risk of overload, to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is my second attendance in a week at a European Standing Committee. When these Committees first sat, three or four years ago, I called in on one to see how they worked. Earlier, I asked some of my hon. Friends what sort of notice they get of the volume of papers needed for a sitting like today's. It is important that hon. Members have enough notice—having sufficient notice to discuss an issue is a crucial part of bringing Ministers to account. Having information only at the last minute is not good enough. That is the ethos under which I and my ministerial colleagues operate, and I understand that that is the case in other Departments. If any hon. Member thinks that we are not being open and transparent, it would be a failure on our part and should be brought to our attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome very much what the Minister has to say. I once sat where he now sits, so I understand the problem of making papers available early. Anything that he can do to place documents in the Library—and to publicise that—at an early stage for those who are not members of a European Standing Committee, but who wish to attend, will be much appreciated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly consider that. I do not know of the mechanics of the matter, but I knew some time ago about last week's and this week's sittings, and there seemed to be plenty of warning. However, I heard only this week of another sitting in December, which seems to be very short notice. To some extent,
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
of course, we depend on the Select Committee, and what it decides should be scrutinised. I shall ensure that the maximum possible notice of sittings is given because, as the right hon. Gentleman said, any hon. Member can ask questions in our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may not have looked like it, but I came into the Committee Room this morning armed without about 500 question-and-answer possibilities. By my feet is a file on vitamin B6, because I thought that members of the Committee might ask me about it. However, they obviously have not woken up to the fact that they could have raised that issue and that we could have had an interesting debate on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that. The right hon. Gentleman alluded to my difficulties, but I am not sure what they are. I made it clear that Members of the Committee needed information and that they needed it in good time to play a full role in our proceedings, to be able to scrutinise measures and to hold Ministers to account. I shall ensure that we in MAFF do everything to help hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) misunderstood my intervention. Regulation did not force the beef industry to feed ground-up cattle to cattle. Let us suppose that people in the beef industry had argued about product liability, and had said that private sector suppliers decided to supply such feed to the industry, telling them that the cattle would be okay. They could have argued that it was not the Government who made such a requirement, but that a problem had arisen, that people had died, that the European Parliament was up in arms and that the European Commission had ordered a beef ban, which would cost a lot of money—£4 billion—for which the taxpayer would have to fork out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the matter has caused terrible personal and economic problems in the industry, but no one in the industry has accepted full product liability all the way down the chain. I was alluding not to the consequences of the announcement on 20 March 1996 but to the decisions that were made in 1979 and 1980 to change rendering temperatures and to feed ground-up cattle to cattle and poultry. That was not the usual feed for such animals. Human beings, not the animals, decided to feed animals to animals. That is the root cause of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have asked more than once about the cause of BSE and have received the reply, "Well, Minister, we have changed the feed and the incidence of BSE has gone down." That is not the proper answer because, as the hon. Member for Ludlow said, scientific opinion states that the feed was not the cause of BSE. However, I suspect that the matter will be the subject of another discussion—probably later this evening, given the nature of the Adjournment debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that product liability has been accepted by Opposition Members in a way that I did not expect it to be accepted. That brings me to primary agriculture produce. Product liability must be accepted. In principle, it should go back all the way to primary producers. We are willing to accept that there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
should be a mechanism to enable the defence of due diligence, but it should not undermine liability. In the past, codes of practice have been written as a deliberate way in which to undermine regulations. We support product liability in relation to primary agricultural produce, but we do not want to make the regulations onerous or unfair. Our initial discussions with the National Farmers Union showed that product liability would not cause a lot of extra cost to farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether the right hon. Member for Fylde supports the use of the precautionary principle. I accept that it is not clear, but when there is some doubt about risk and the uncertainty of the science, I do not see any other way in which Ministers can operate other than by way of the precautionary principle. That means that we leave ourselves open to being overcautious and too prescriptive. However, we do so in the interests of protecting the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will not be in the position of many former Minister who took no action because they said that the risk was not great enough. There has been no inquiry into BSE, although we are considering one. There has been vast public expenditure and people are dying. A moral issue must be faced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the risk is negligible—perhaps one in 100 million. There is a scale of risk, not a zero risk. In case we had a discussion of risk analysis and risk communication, I brought part of a Department of Health paper on how to express levels of risk—whether one in one, one in 10, or one in 300 billion—so that people can understand them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scientific advisers might tell Ministers that a risk is negligible, but there is still a risk. It is then up to Ministers to decide whether to stand up in public and say, "The risk is negligible, and we don't think we should do anything about it," or, "The risk is negligible, but we are uncertain about it, therefore, we must take some action to meet it, even though only a few people might be affected." I know which side of the argument I would be on, and I know that I would be accused of being over-cautious. Frankly, we are trying to learn the lessons of the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that food law is not an issue for the public. However, part of the reason why the Labour party is in government and the Conservatives are in opposition is that the previous Government did not take food safety seriously; it was not their top priority. No one can gainsay that. I do not attack individual Ministers or Members of Parliament, but we know from discussions before the election that that was the previous Government's ethos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ludlow referred to the weakness of scientific advice. I agree that we must take account of all technical advice. I have made it clear in public announcements that I am prepared to listen to any scientist, even those who are not inside the loop of their peers. Within the Ministry, scientists claim that, if they had extra help or a laboratory in which to carry out their experiments, they could find the answers, although that might not be the scientific community's advice. If something can be done without causing massive disruption, we are prepared to do it. There are examples of that within MAFF, such as our efforts to
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
deal with BSE, pesticides and veterinary medicines. We want to know scientists' views, even if they are not on an independent committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My probing was about the part of the Green Paper in which the Commission asked, "How far should we be allowed to go in developing a precautionary principle?" I sought to discover the Minister's views on the boundary between those areas in which the Commission thought that that should apply and those in which specific scientific advice was available. I also sought to discover whether the Minister was happy about that, given the questions of accountability where the precautionary principle was used. I also asked a probing question to discover the Minister's views on the Commission's competency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not born yesterday. Sometimes the asking of a question tells far more about the questioner's views than about those of the Minister. We shall not be open to challenge from our European partners on the precautionary principle or risk assessment where there is uncertainty. We shall translate how we operate in this country into our discussions on the Green Paper. I do not deny that there is difficulty over the boundaries. There are cost implications. Matters related to the level of risk are codified. Where there is genuine debate, we can argue that we must take precautions to meet those levels of risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as the hon. Member for Ludlow said, not all scientists agree. In general, the scientific advisory committees operate on consensus. I am not aware that they go round collecting opinions and then vote, but they usually reach a consensus and then advise Ministers. Whether that advice is accepted is entirely up to Ministers. Nobody in the Government will blame any scientific committee or official for making wrong decisions. They do not make the decisions; Ministers will do that and will be accountable for them. I cannot put it more clearly. We want a wide spectrum of advice from the creme de la creme—the people at the top of their profession. I do not dismiss advisers as having a vested interest just because they happen to work in industry, as was suggested this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We collect scientific advice from academia, pubic and private research institutions, the medical profession and industry. A wealth of scientific advice is available from the food manufacturing industry to Government and it would be stupid not to listen to and incorporate that advice. Just because industry may have a direct interest does not mean that we do not regard what it says as worthy of merit. The interest is declared very transparently and the integrity of the people involved is not under threat, except when there are vested interests from other quarters, as happened with vitamin B6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister concedes that there must be circumstances in which he would not accept the advice of a scientific committee. Otherwise, he is saying that he would accept advice regardless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The decision on whether to accept advice will be taken by Ministers. I am sure that there have been occasions on which independent scientific advice has been offered but rejected by Ministers. They must be accountable for that and must say so. I am not saying, "Feed me the advice and we will accept it. I have no function; I am just the postman." That is not how we operate. We will question the practicalities of the advice, but, of course, the science is more difficult. It is a matter of what flows from either accepting or rejecting advice, but such decisions will be made by Ministers, not scientists. It will be science-based advice, but the decision will be made by Ministers. I cannot put it more clearly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers may well say on occasion that they are not accepting certain advice because it is disputed in the scientific community. That is perfectly legitimate, provided that it is done openly and transparently. If things go wrong, Ministers carry the can. The independent scientific advisers cannot be blamed. On that basis, the relationship with scientific advisers can be very good. Of course, there will be occasions on which advice is rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk asked specific questions about the progress in setting up the food standards agency and some of the recent press reports. I cannot say more than I have done already. The White Paper was drafted by MAFF. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food, my right hon. Friend the Member of Copeland (Dr. Cunningham) has lead responsibility for it at the request of our right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. Clearly, it is not a MAFF document, but was produced in conjunction with a range of Whitehall departments and very much in conjunction with our right hon. and hon. Friends in the Department of Health. A range of Departments have been involved and the membership of the Cabinet sub-committees has been published. The process has involved both discussion and the Whitehall paper chase, which is an enormous trail to follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper is virtually complete and will be published at the turn of the year—just before or just after Christmas—with the authority of the whole Government. It will be a very radical document, implementing the principles and thrust of Professor James' report, which said that there should be an independent food standards agency, funded by the public and answerable to the House and Health Ministers. The agency should ensure that the food chain from plough to plate is fully enforced in respect of safety of food, including a range of issues such as labelling, nutrition, veterinary medicines, pesticides and whatever is in the food. To a greater or lesser extent in different parts of the food chain, the food agency will have a role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for confirming that the White Paper will be published at about the turn of the year. May I seek his assurance that it will be published when Parliament is sitting? If so, can he tell us whether a Minister from his Ministry, from the Department of Health or from some other department, will deliver the statement on the White Paper to the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot answer the right hon. Gentleman's final question, because, while my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is the lead Minister, it will be a collective decision. For all that I know, the statement may be given by another member of the Government. I am not responsible for the timetable. I know that White Papers can be published in recesses; that was done during the summer recess. However, as the White Paper will be the subject of consultation both within the House and outside, it will be in everyone's interest, and in the interests of openness, transparency and good government, for it to be published when the House is sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My specific point about the food standards agency was to ask the Minister to confirm or deny reports that the Minister without Portfolio had a view on what should be included in the food standards agency's remit—in particular, on aspects of nutrition—that he was being heavily lobbied on the matter and that a paper was being circulated in Whitehall. Can the Minister confirm or deny that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests. There has been collective discussion in Whitehall involving Ministers from all Departments. About 10 different Departments have been involved. There are five agricultural Departments when one counts the territorial Departments. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Treasury were also involved, and my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster chairs the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Food Safety. Ministers from every Department have contributed their views by submissions and by correspondence. There is no secret about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 14 October, if I recall correctly, my hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health and I consulted on the issue of nutrition with relevant stakeholders from 24 separate organisations. We gave them a three or four page document in advance setting out how we were minded to proceed—virtually a draft of part of the White Paper. There is no secret; we wanted their views on the matter. That was an extra bit of consultation over and above the consultation on the James report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no consensus on the issue of nutrition; indeed, it is not a single issue. The other day, I counted about 30 different aspects of nutrition, some of which would not come within the remit of the food standards agency. They are matters of general public health and education. Other aspects of nutrition clearly relate to food. That split was presented to those people; there is no secret about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simpson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to press the Minister on that point. I understand that he has undertaken wide consultation. However, a specific question was raised not by me but by a Labour Member of the Committee. The Minister referred to press reports about it. Can he simply confirm or deny whether the Minister without Portfolio has commented on the issue, yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Transparency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will produce, collectively and transparently, a White Paper that will revolutionise—I was not going to use that word, I have used the word radical, because it is a radical document—the way in which we consider food policy in this country. That is the result of collective discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the practice begun by the previous Government, the membership of Cabinet Sub-Committees is known and published; there is no secret about it. All Ministers on that Sub-Committee, and Ministers not on that Sub-Committee—I am not myself a member, but I attended its meetings—have had many opportunities for oral and written discussion and I cannot think of any Minister who has not taken advantage of that. The White Paper has been in draft form since last summer, when we started setting out the guiding principles for drafting. Ministers gave an idea of the direction in which they wanted to go. I freely admit that I have probably seen more drafts than any other Minister because I have a hands-on approach. Some drafts were not ready in time because I wanted to read them properly and not have just 48 hours to do so. I chucked them in the bin and did not send them back for comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for North Shropshire has obviously taken five; we do not accept what he said about the HACCP system. It is accepted worldwide as an effective system. It is operated by professionals. There might be marginal room for debate, but I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's analogy with the lift operators. That goes back to the argument about product liability and the precautionary principle that I raised with the hon. Member for Ludlow. I made a note at the time to raise the issue with him, but he gave me a better opportunity of doing so.

Regulation and direction depend on the context. In some areas, regulations are better when specific controls are imposed. The additives directives, for example, are extremely detailed and would probably
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
be better implemented by regulation. We must use common sense about that. Nevertheless—let us be honest—directives and regulations are sometimes the subject of a turf war in Brussels. The issue cannot necessarily be laid down in tablets of stone.

On the sloppy use of language, we are not dealing with internal documents. It is a matter of diplomacy. We all occasionally hear foreign affairs Ministers and ambassadors putting the most outrageous points of principle into the most delicate language when they are trying to put a country's case. Whether that is done at the United Nations or in Brussels, we have to understand it. We are also trying to use delicate language, with the aim of achieving success. We do not wish to antagonise our European partners. We want the Green Paper to be a success and we want to give a lead on it. We seek to improve it by adding to its basic principles. We cannot do that by megaphone diplomacy. It is much better to use moderate, common-sense language, but to be hard when making decisions and that is what we shall do, as we have already shown. We are not subservient and we want to be good members of the European Community, but, where we have to, we shall take action in British interests. When the time for decision comes, the hard edge will show. In the mean time, we want to reach an acceptable position and we shall not do that by being bellicose and using wild language.

I have covered some aspects of the scientific community and I have no doubt that the issue will arise again this year. The right hon. Member for Fylde asked a key question about the UK presidency. We shall indeed, during January to June next year, seek to publish the list of EC rules that we want repealed and the reasons why. That gives us a target date. I hope that that is an acceptable time scale.

I cannot deal with the definition of "wholesomeness" or of athletes' food, but I can say that there will be no extension of the nine, limited categories of the two types of infant milks, weaning foods, slimming foods, medical foods, gluten-free foods, diabetic foods, low-salt foods and athletes' foods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
