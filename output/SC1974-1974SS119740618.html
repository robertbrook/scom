	<div class='title'>PROVISIONS REGARDING ACQUISITION OF LAND BY LOCAL AUTHORITY</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin F. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 85, in page 23, line 27, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'and the Secretary of State shall confirm such an order or instruct the local authority to rescind the draft order within a period of three months of the date of submission, except that, where the order is the subject of a public inquiry, the said period shall be six months'.</p></blockquote>
I make no apology for moving this amendment. It touches on a matter that I raised on Second Reading, namely, the very long time that it takes for St. Andrew's House to confirm compulsory purchase orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At various times in our proceedings, hon. Members have referred to bureaucratic delays and the time taken by local authorities. If we try to cut down a month here and 28 days there in local authority procedures, we are endeavouring to deal with the mote while not casting out the beam in our eye. The major
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
delays occur, not at the local authority end but at St. Andrew's House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Confirmation of a treatment area order can take up to eight months. Confirmation of a compulsory purchase order can take between 18 months and two years. The Bill deals with the period for the confirmation of treatment order areas. Now that we have housing action areas, the period has been cut to 28 days. In my view, we should deal similarly with delays with compulsory purchase orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the Secretary of State should have a maximum of three months in which to confirm a compulsory purchase order. In my view, that is not unduly restrictive. I recognise that, where a public inquiry is necessary, there will have to be additional procedures gone through, and therefore I suggest a maximum period of six months. That should be adequate time in which to call a public inquiry and to arrive at a decision. It is necessary to give only one month's notice of the date of a public inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give one or two examples of delays that we face at present. An order promoted by Edinburgh Corporation—the Great Junction Street Order—was submitted to the Secretary of State on 6th June 1972. Confirmation was not received until 14th March of this year, nearly two years later. We cannot blame the delay on the need to hold a public inquiry. There was a public inquiry into this Order. But it was held on 31st January 1973. It was 14 months after the inquiry was heard before the Secretary of State made up his mind whether to confirm the Order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Delays of that kind are inexcusable. They are inconsistent with the desire to get on with the swift treatment of Scotland's slums. Even with my amendment, the maximum time which can be taken is 14 months. I submit that further delay would be inconsistent with our desire to treat our slums quickly. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the comments of the hon. Member for Edinburgh Central (Mr. Cook).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put forward a word of caution. When the Secretary of State has to consider what may be detailed representations on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
complex schemes, the time lag must vary from case to case. If there is a good flow of housing action areas and there is no question of local authorities not having work to do, the time limit is not so vital as it is in relation to the matters affecting local authorities that we discussed when we dealt with earlier amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be cautious in the way that he answers this brief debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) that these matters have to be looked at in the context that, following this Bill, we hope that local authorities will have running programmes of housing action areas so that, if there is delay in one area, there is plenty of work for a local authority still to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot recommend that the Committee accept the amendment. In a case where a public inquiry was involved, it would put an impossible burden on the Secretary of State. It would mean that he would have to meet timetables which were not wholly within his control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not able to comment on the Great Junction Street Order in Edinburgh because, in any event, it happened under the previous administration and not under this one. If my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Cook) cares to write to me about it or about any other cases of which he is aware, I shall look into the circumstances and write to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this administration, it is our intention to see that proposals are dealt with as expeditiously as possible. Where no public inquiry is required, I should not expect the period of three months referred to in the amendment to be exceeded, except in very unusual cases. But when there is a public inquiry—and the question whether there should be a public inquiry is not a matter for the Secretary of State; it is statutorily controlled—difficulties arise if time limits are laid down for the Secretary of State which he is not in a position to control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not happy that inquiry proceedings should take an undue length of time. I agree that there have been cases where there has been delay in setting up the inquiry, delay in the Reporter getting on with the job, and delay in the Reporter
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
producing his report. I find it quite unacceptable that, an inquiry having been held, there should be a considerable delay before the Reporter produces his report. Where that happens it is thoroughly unsatisfactory, and I shall do all that I can to see that delays of that kind do not occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other contexts we are looking at public inquiry procedures in any event. I can given the assurance that I want to look at the administration of public inquiry procedures to see whether we can speed up decisions and avoid unnecessary delays. By that I do not mean delays which arise from the proper discussion and determination of the merits of proposals. I mean delays which arise unnecessarily not out of the nature of proposals. I am already looking into these matters, and I hope that we can avoid the unnecessary delays which have occurred in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that assurance, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central will withdraw his amendment. It would place obligations on the Secretary of State which the existing measure would not. The result of the amendment might in certain circumstances produce consequences which my hon. Friend would not wish to see happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to emphasise that, although I cited the Great Junction Street Order, that is not an exceptional case. There are many others similar to it. In the case of the Springfield Street compulsory order, 10 months elapsed between the public inquiry and the decision. In the case of the Argyll Street Order a whole year elapsed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) that, although it is prefectly true that if a local authority has a rolling programme the holding up of one order need not interfere with the remainder of the programme, the people residing in the treatment area affected by the delay cannot understand the reason for the delay and want to know why their order is being held up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the assurance which has just been given by my hon. Friend the Minister of State, especially when he says that he does not regard three months as exceptional where there is no public inquiry involved and that it is his intention to cut down the delays.

	<div class='title'>COMPENSATION IN RESPECT OF LAND ACQUIRED COMPULSORILY</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 71 in page 24, line 26, leave out "exceed" and insert "be less than".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the amendment is to ensure that justice is done where an owner is compulsorily purchased. It may be that as the Bill stands a person whose property has been compulsorily purchased will receive compensation up to the value of the site at the time that the valuation is made. That is the best that he can hope for. The best that he will get is that rather out of date justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the amendment is to ensure that he gets at least the out-of-date justice. It may be that a better form of wording would have been something to the effect that the person whose property is compulsorily purchased will receive "not other than the valuation". But as the Bill stands, it will not exceed the value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a valuation takes place some time before the property is transferred, with the rise in land values and the fact that the owner has to find other accommodation, it would be justice to say that the valuation should be on the basis of being not less than the value at the time when the valuation was made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson). It is a matter on which we need some information. It appears to the layman that what we are saying here is that if a house is in a clearance area and does not meet the tolerable standard, the maximum compensation is site value. There is also a provision that, in addition to the site value, there will be compensation for disturbance. If that is so, it is unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
Many people spend a great deal of money buying substandard tenements in which to live, and they put all their life savings into them. If we say that, irrespective of the circumstances, site value plus disturbance is the maximum that we shall give, it is unjust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that we may have misread the clause but, if that is what it says, we object to it strongly. Although demolition costs may be expensive, it would be unfair if this was to be the basis of compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing here with houses which do not meet the tolerable standard. It has been a long-standing principle that market value is not paid in those cases but that cleared site value is paid instead. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) has perhaps misunderstood the effect of this, and so perhaps has the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson). There are special provisions under Section 18 of the 1969 Act to ensure that owner-occupiers—not landlords owning for letting—receive a supplementary payment, and this brings the compensation up to the market value. So in the case of an owner-occupier, someone who buys a tenement property below tolerable standards, it will be taken over, and the payment made to him is not the cleared site value but the market value, which is usually a good deal greater. Even slum houses which are in areas of shortage have a saleable value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition there is the responsibility on the local authority to rehouse; there is also the home loss and disturbance payment under the 1973 Act, so that there is no question of an owner-occupier receiving only the cleared site value for the house. The only person who receives that is the landlord. I am speaking here about a right which goes back many years and which is a well-established principle in housing legislation. I hope therefore that the hon. Gentleman will feel that the position of the owner-occupier is well taken care of, and that he will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister clear up one point? Would the site value basis apply equally, whether in a housing action area a property is for demolition or improvement? Would the same criteria apply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the important point is whether the house is below the tolerable standard. It is not a question of the kind of area that it is in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this market value for the owner-occupier a right, or is it entirely discretionary? The Minister said that under previous legislation the owner-occupier would have a possibility of getting market value. Would the owner-occupier have to battle for this, or is he entitled to it by right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a right, not a discretionary payment by the local authority. I appreciate that it is difficult to follow this point because the Housing (Scotland) Act 1969 is attracted in Schedule 3, page 45. But the position is taken care of.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 76, in page 28, line 31, leave out from 'may' to 'area' in line 33 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>so soon as they receive notification from the
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this amendment it would be convenient to consider Amendment No. 79, in page 28, line 31, leave out 'final resolution under section 20' and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'draft resolution under sections 15, 16 or 17'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is perhaps one of the most important parts of the Bill. As it stands, the Bill would allow a time period of six months to elapse from the laying down of the draft resolution to the time when the local authority could control occupation in the housing action areas. Much was made of this point by several speakers on Second Reading, and I do not intend to delay the Committee for long, but I fear that if the six months period is to be retained in the Bill it will act as a magnet to unscrupulous landlords to move into housing action areas and try to take advantage of gullible tenants. It would be unfortunate if this were allowed because the matter had not been properly debated in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have drafted the amendment in a slightly different way from Amendment No. 79, to take effect at the period after which the Secretary of State has considered the draft resolution and has notified the local authority either that he rescinds the resolution or that he does not propose to rescind it. We have chosen the later period rather than the period in Amendment No. 79 when the draft resolution is passed because I feel that a great extension of powers is being given to local authorities under the Bill in any event. Although I believe that under the housing treatment areas powers of control of occupation orders were given to local authorities immediately after the draft resolution had been passed, in this case local authorities are being given greater scope to declare housing action areas rather than treatment areas. It seems from reading the Bill that until the time when the Secretary of State has notified the local authority that he does not propose to rescind the resolution it is passive and inoperative. Therefore, we have chosen this particular moment as being the first viable moment for this power to be operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will seriously consider this amendment. If an amendment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
of this sort is not allowed, I feel that tenants will be exploited in a similar way to that in which they were exploited in the past in housing treatment areas, in such a way that the public would justifiably blame this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will consider this amendment carefully. It is one of the most important amendments which we have moved in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our fear is twofold. If a draft order is made, and approved by the Secretary of State, and later approved by him as a final order, every person in the area concerned will have an entitlement to rehousing. This is particularly applicable in cities, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. White) will confirm that people who are in properties which are to be demolished, or from which they are to be forcibly removed, are given top priority. I know of many cases in which housing officials in cities have been almost tearing their hair out because when faced with tenants in properties which are to be knocked down and four or five offers of rehousing are made, the tenants say they will not move until they get a house in a particular housing scheme. Local authorities have certain reserve powers in this connection, but, bearing in mind the views which the public and the media might take, the authorities generally go out of their way to accommodate people in areas suitable to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has special knowledge of unscrupulous landlords, and many other people also take the view that unscrupulous landlords are a problem. However, I fear that some unscrupulous tenants can be a problem. If an area is to become a housing action area, it becomes highly desirable for people to move into it, by buying or renting houses, in order to get another house in a nice area later. We should not kid ourselves about this. There is a big problem in cities, not so much of acute housing shortage but shortage of the type of houses which people want to move into. In many cities there is the anomaly of a long housing list with, at the same time, a considerable number of empty council houses in the non-desirable areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unfair and unjust to a local authority if there were a mad scramble for housing in particular areas because word
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
got around that if people moved into a housing action area they would be able to hold a pistol to the local authority's head and say "I want a nice house in a nice area." This would also be particularly unfair to tenants who may have been waiting 10, 15 or even 20 years for transference to more suitable areas for work or family reasons. It would be unjust if all the available houses were eaten up by people unscrupulously moving into housing action areas because they heard that there might be rehousing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to be fair and reasonable to people living in these areas. We did not want to put unreasonable restrictions on them because the local authority may make a housing action area and if a control order is being exercised which results in considerable restrictions on the freedom and liberty of people living in those areas there is a problem of trying to get a balance between the two. We have suggested in Amendment No. 76 a half way house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not said that when a local authority designates an area in a draft order, we should immediately put on a control occupation order. I have a strong feeling that the moment the Bill becomes law, some local authorities will designate many housing action areas in cities, towns and counties. Whatever happens, local authorities in bidding for their share of what cash would be available under this legislation will ask for much more than they expect to get. It would be unreasonable if we were to put a restriction on every area where a local authority proposes a draft order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will look at an order and in some cases chuck it out of the window within 28 days and say that the proposals are not on, but other orders may need more time for consideration. We suggest that he should put a control of occupation order on those to take them over the first hurdle, those which are not rejected by the Secretary of State as being unreasonable or unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the first amendment might mean putting a control of occupation order on areas which will not prove to be housing action areas, but statistically those which go over the first hurdle will probably go over the last hurdle, although in an amended form. Therefore, our amendment is a happy balance. It we make no amendment to the clause, an area will become
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
known as a housing action area and there will be a mad scramble to obtain houses simply, or perhaps partly, in the hope that it will result in the allocation of highly desirable council houses in a highly desirable area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must bear in mind the problems of our housing management departments, which have a difficult job and are constantly accused of unfairness because of their housing allocation policies. We must not make their problems even more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that our amendment strikes a happy balance. I would not be happy with Amendment No. 79 which seeks to leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>'final resolution under section 20.</p></blockquote>
and to insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'draft resolution under sections 15, 16 or 17'.</p></blockquote>
which I know the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Cook) is to propound. The intention is the same as in our amendment. However, if we are to have control of occupation in every area where a local authority housing committee or council wants a housing action area, it would place an unreasonable burden on the people living in those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment strikes the right balance. I am not suggesting that my hon. Friend's wording is accurate, although he has considerable legal experience which has been helpful to hon. Members on this side. However, I suggest that we must have something along these lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. If we do not have an amendment like this, we shall be putting an intolerable burden on local authorities which have the problem of explaining their housing allocation policies and assuring people that they are fair and just.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be extremely happy if the Minister chose to accept Amendment No. 79. I tabled this amendment because of experience in Edinburgh with a number of unscrupulous landlords. One in particular was referred to by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) on Second Reading, namely, Mr. John Dorward, a council tenant who also lets out 200 other properties in the city,
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
mostly in slum clearance areas, some of which are not owned by him. On occasion he has entered a derelict tenement, opened up a flat that the authority owns, and has closed and re-let it in his name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a letter from the sanitary inspector establishing that in one month alone this landlord was guilty of 26 separate breaches of control of occupation orders. Since that letter was written, Mr. Dorward has been before the court on a number of occasions. It must be of particular and acute concern to the Committee and to the House that the law as it stands has apparently been powerless to get this man to cease this vicious practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious that the amendment should be accepted, not so much to affect Mr. Dorward's operations, as to help the victims of his practices—those whom the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) mentioned as the unfortunate tenants who find themselves in this position. They are vulnerable. I know that many of the people whom this landlord specialises in rehousing are deserted mothers. They are chosen by him because they find it difficult to fight back. They do not have a full grasp of their rights and they do not have a man to stand up for them. Often they pay between £4 and £6 a week for a room and kitchen in slum conditions without any amenities. Sometimes they lose their family allowance books to the landlord so that he can claim the rent. Indeed, on one or two occasions they have been the victims of clear and insidious intimidation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not feasible to imagine that they will be rehoused in modern council houses. If the local authority has already rehoused someone from a house in which someone else is the second tenant, it may refuse to rehouse them. In those conditions the families are the victims of a circle in which they are intimidated and harassed by the landlord and at the same time they are ignored by the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The control of occupation order comes into force with the draft resolution. I do not suggest that we should create a new situation. We should retain the status quo, which has not hitherto created any difficulty, when draft resolutions have been rescinded. This is one of the great advantages that Scottish housing legislation has over English legislation where there is no parallel provision. I am anxious
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
that we should, not redress, but maintain the present position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point concerns me about Amendment No. 76. The hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) in his amendment refers to the fact that the control of occupation order should come into force when the local authority is informed that the Secretary of State does not wish to rescind the resolution. Under the legislation the Secretary of State has power to ask for an extension beyond 28 days if he thinks that the circumstances warrant it. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) indicated that in some cases the Secretary of State will require a longer period because of the complexity and difficulty of a particular order. I appreciate that. Last week I suggested that the power to take longer than 28 days may become the rule rather than the exception.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point referred to the approval of the final order where detailed considerations have to be taken into account. But in deciding whether a resolution should be chucked out of the window or looked at further, I do not think there will be any real problem about extending the 28 days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Gentleman referred earlier to the final order. However, his argument applies equally to the draft order. I think that these problems will arise with the draft order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Amendment No. 76 as opposed to Amendment No. 79 is accepted, I fear that there will be occasions when it will take the Secretary of State some months to notify a local authority, and for those months there will be no control of occupation order in force. I hope, therefore, that one or other of the amendments is accepted by the Minister to rectify the situation. Naturally, I should prefer him to accept Amendment No. 79.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to say right away that I am agreeable to these amendments in principle, subject to redrafting and the necessary consequential amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with the situation between the passing of a draft resolution and the passing of the final resolution and with the discretionary power of the local
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
authority, which is not a power which i would necessarily wish to exercise in every case. The period may be one of months, but there is a tendency in Committee for hon. Members always to make the period the absolute maximum under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It generally is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it is not our intention that it should always be the maximum. We hope that the whole procedure will in normal circumstances go through more quickly than is sometimes indicated by hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the difficulty in the period between the draft and the final resolution that we may, on the one hand, have unscrupulous tenants—that may be an unfair charge—or tenants who are willing to take a chance on the situation that, by moving in in the interim period, they will eventually be rehoused, as it were, outside their normal turn in the housing queue. But we are even more concerned about the landlords who may exploit this position in an unscrupulous way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A landlord who has an empty house which he knows is to be demolished or is to disappear in an improvement scheme because it is to be integrated with another house would have a period between the draft and final resolutions when he would be able to offer that house to a tenant at perhaps an unreasonable and, indeed, an illegal rent on the basis that the tenant would know that at the end of the period he would have an opportunity of being re-housed because of the operation of the housing action area. That kind of situation is ripe for exploitation by unscrupulous landlords. Therefore, I accept that we must amend the Bill to prevent that happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention has been made of a particular landlord in Edinburgh—Mr. John Dorward. I understand that he has been acting illegally by breaching control of occupation orders. Changing the date of the operation of a control of occupation order by itself would not affect a landlord who is determined to act illegally. However, I hope that the considerable increase in fines under subsection (4) from £20 to £200 will deter people in those circumstances. That is the way to deter landlords who deliberately set out to break the law. We are principally dealing with people who will exploit
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
weaknesses in the law. Therefore, I think that the argument for making a change is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the amendments to be withdrawn so that the Government can table the necessary amendments on Report. Apart from anything else, there will be a number of consequential amendments. Therefore, it would be more convenient if they were all put down together. I should also like an opportunity to consider the wording of such amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 79 would bring the situation where a control of occupation order might be made the date of the draft resolution. Amendment No. 76 would have the effect of bringing it from the date at which there had been no requirement to rescind the draft resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In normal circumstances the period would be very short. I do not think that there would be any great practical difference if, in the normal course of events, the fact that there had been a draft resolution was not publicly known or at least no notice had been given to the tenants and owners in the area, because that happens only when the Secretary of State has not withheld his consent to a draft resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to look into this matter more carefully to see which alternative we should write into the Bill. In normal circumstances, it ought not to make much difference. If we are to make this change to prevent what might be the exploitation of a loophole, we had better ensure that we get it right. There is no point in making an amendment perhaps leaving another loophole. Therefore, I should like to consider how this should be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to that, if the amendments are withdrawn, I assure the Committee that the argument is accepted and I will ensure that the necessary amendments are brought forward on Report. At the same time as I put down the amendments I will let both hon. Members concerned know why I have chosen a particular amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for considering the amendment and for giving the assurances that he has given. The Minister has recognised the importance of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
I should like to support what the hon. Gentleman said about unscrupulous landlords who break the law. The amendment is not designed for them, because we shall not stop them by putting down amendments which create new laws which they are able to break. It is designed for the not so famous unscrupulous landlords—those who might be tempted. In fairness to them, I hope that the Minister will consider the later rather than the earlier date. The earlier date could create unfairnesses to landlords who are not being unscrupulous but who find themselves with housing action areas which may, 28 days later, be declared not to be housing action areas after all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the Minister's assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 82, in page 29, line 14, leave out '£200' and insert £400'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment arises in connection with the previous discussion about unscrupulous landlords, particularly Mr. John Dorward, who has been in court six times and each time has been fined and, on leaving the courtroom, has announced that he intends to continue with his unscrupulous practice. The maximum fine in each case is £20. The last time he appeared before the court, only two months ago, the sheriff said that it was unreasonable that he should be limited to a maximum fine of £20 when the rent in any one case was £450.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the suggestion of the change in the Bill from £20 to £200. Nevertheless, I do not see why we should stop short of putting in the maximum which is possible on summary conviction. I suggest that the maximum should be £400. We should give the sheriff discretion to impose a fine up to £400 in cases where he thinks it appropriate. I hope that the next time John Dorward appears before him he will consider his a fit case for imposing the maximum fine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot recommend the Committee to accept the amendment. We are already increasing the maximum fine from £20 under the 1969 Act to £200, and I believe that we now have a fine that should be able to deter even the most unscrupulous landlord who deliberately sets out to break the law because he believes he can make more money than he is likely to pay in fines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that the normal limit on a common law charge brought before a sheriff is £100, and it would be most unusual for a statutory penalty on summary proceedings to be higher than £200. We are therefore providing a figure which is a sufficient deterrent and which is largely in line with penalties for what are considered to be serious breaches of the law. I think that £200 is enough, and I cannot recommend the Committee to go beyond that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that there is any basically right figure here. When there has been deliberate, wilful and continued breach of the law, the sheriff takes a serious view of the event and uses his powers accordingly. His present powers are inadequate, but the fine of £200 should be sufficient to deal with this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister says, but Parliament should look carefully at fines in case they become out of date. There is a case for a threshold clause on fines to take account of rises in the cost of living. I was staggered to get a note yesterday from an economist telling me that at the present rate of inflation the £ today would be worth precisely 2p in less than 20 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was he the hon. Member's stockbroker?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it was someone who claimed to be an economist, and I am told that economists are usually reliable people. This is a factor that we should bear in mind. Fines fixed today could, with the present rate of inflation, be of ludicrous value in a few years' time. We fix fines only for a period of years and therefore we have to bear in mind that with the present rate of inflation the fine we are now discussing could be worth about £4 in less than 20 years' time. I hope that it is a matter that the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
will discuss with his colleagues. I know that the Government, like previous Government's, are trying to cope with inflation—rather less successfully than we did—but we must pave the way for inflation-proof fines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I agree with my hon. Friend the Minister for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor), about the difficulties of inflation, I want to leave that point to one side. I do not believe that £200 is nearly enough: I would make it £500. For some of these people a fine of £200 is just a flea-bite. If it is not possible for some legal reason —and I am not clear about that—under the summary procedure to have a £500 fine, let us use another procedure and take these people to a higher court. I am sure that that would meet with general approval from the public and would also act as a real deterrent. I shall be interested to know what the hon. Members on both sides of the Committee think about this, but I do not regard £200 as being enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the explanation of the technical reasons for not having a fine greater than £200. In the light of that, I suppose that I must seek to withdraw my amendment, but I do not share my hon. Friend's optimism that a fine at this level will deter people such as the man we have been discussing today. He is charging rents of £5 a week. Unfortunately, it takes about a year to get a breach of control of occupation order before the courts and in those circumstances it is almost certain that the fine that will he imposed under the Bill will be less than a year's rent, which this man will have collected in the time it takes to get the case before a court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should take a lesson from the fact that over the last year we have failed to control this man. Edinburgh Corporation became so desperate at its failure to stop him that at one stage it proposed to evict him from his council house. However, it decided that that would not be right in principle. This man has an income of £1,000 a week and it is foolish to believe that a £200 fine is sufficient to make him cease from his reprehensible practice. I have just received a note as a result of which I shall withdraw my original statement. Instead I should like to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly the figure of £200 is in the Bill, but there is also provision for further fines of £5 per day per house, so that if Mr. Dorward is letting 20 houses, he can be fined £5 a day per house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The fine imposed for a breach of a control of occupation order relates to the one specific house and the one tenant. The fine of £5 per day applies only if he continues to let the same tenant the same house for a fixed period. He cannot be fined for the whole range of his tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason I passed my hon. Friend the note asking him not to withdraw his amendment is that I wanted to say a word or two in reply to the points made. I did not want him to deprive me of that opportunity, especially since I thought I might have been able to say something helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall consider the points made here. I am attracted to the idea of being able to keep fines in line with the real values, and that is the point that I have made on a number of occasions on other legislation. There are objections to doing that sort of thing by order, but I shall certainly look into that. The normal procedure is that penalties are laid down in substantive legislation and not by regulations which, as we know, do not always get the attention which they may deserve, so there may be difficulty from that point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we should provide the alternative of imprisonment as well as a fine. I am told that that would be unprecedented, but that does not seem to me to be sufficient of an objection by itself in this kind of legislation. If the amendment is ultimately withdrawn, I shall reconsider the matter before Report and certainly before the Bill reaches the statute book to see whether we can do something better to deal with these worse cases of deliberate, wilful and continual breach of the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment deals with an essential point in Part III. The clause is the first containing powers to evict. One of the dangers of this sort of Bill, when we have been discussing throughout our proceedings the provision of better housing and the clearing of slums, is that unless we are careful, we shall pass legislation which will create homelessness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is simply to ensure that before the sheriff makes an order for possession of a house, he should be satisfied that the tenant has been offered alternative accommodation which is reasonably suitable to him. It may be that this is already covered under subsection (3), but it certainly is not defined and the matter is left very much to the discretion of the sheriff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
There is a danger, and I see examples frequently in my constituency where there is a shortage of houses, of people being asked to leave a house when they cannot find alternative accommodation because it simply does not exist. It would be disastrous if as a result of the clause tenants were thrown out of their houses with no homes to go to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter may be covered by subsection (3) but it certainly is not clear and from a legal point of view the provision is ambiguous. The amendment would provide an additional safeguard for tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo everything that has been said by the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr Ancram). The provisions as they stand have caused considerable disquiet among people interested in housing and many of us are worried that the draconian powers of summary eviction granted in these cases might be used against innocent tenants. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister, in the light of this concern, will be prepared to accept the amendment. He may wish to draft his own which would be an amalgamation of all the amendments, but it is important that any amendment should contain some reference to location as one of the criteria of suitable alternative accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a suitable alternative to offer a person living in the centre of Edinburgh in one of the slum clearance areas a house at Wester Hailes, even though the house may have adequate plumbing and so forth. It is not an adequate alternative because of the change in district.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate why this and the other amendments have been suggested. The effect of Amendment No. 73 is to impose the same obligation on the sheriff as is imposed under Section 10 of the Rent Act 1971. However, the circumstances with which we are dealing in the Bill are different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new situation is one where there is an element of compulsion on the landlord as well as on the tenant. A housing action area may be declared and the local authority may decide that certain things should be done to the houses in that area. Part III deals with the situation where the landlord is willing to meet the obligations imposed upon him by the local authority, but the tenant is not willing to allow the
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
landlord to discharge those obligations. It is important to bear that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the possibility of the landlord being unwilling to meet his obligations under the Bill and for the local authority compulsorily to acquire his property. Where the landlord, however, was willing to meet his obligations but the tenant was unwilling for that to happen, the local authority would compulsorily acquire the property so that those obligations imposed by the housing action order were carried out whether the tenant liked it or not. Circumstances therefore could arise in which there would be unfairness to the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of Part III is to put right what could otherwise be an unfairness to landlords who might face compulsory orders in circumstances in which they are unnecessary because they are willing to do the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are already protections elsewhere in the Bill and in the clause as a result of which the sheriff can take account of all the circumstances of the case. There is no question of the landlord simply going to the sheriff under this part of the Bill and being able to do with his tenant anything he likes. The safeguards already exist. The safeguards of rehousing, home loss payments, and so on which, we have already discussed, are already in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, some of the apprehensions which have been expressed about Part III are misconceived. Nevertheless, the fact that they have been expressed both elsewhere and by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee leads me to wish to see whether I can put them to rest in the Bill. If the amendments are withdrawn, I shall consider the wording and see whether appropriate amendments can be tabled at a later stage. When the Bill was drafted, we did not intend to provide a charter for landlords against tenants in this part of the Bill, and I do not think that that is what it does. But I am willing to see that people's apprehensions should be set at rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend raised an additional point about location. But that is dealt with in New Clause 3, tabled by the Opposition, in a rather wider context, and I should prefer to deal with the matter when we come to that new clause. I can then consider questions of location as well as other
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
questions raised, and perhaps put down amendments on Report or later.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Minister for the assurances he has given I was not suggesting that landlords' charter was being created. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Cook), from a perhaps slightly more politically biased view, tended to see it in that light. I was concerned merely with the position of the tenant. We have had experience in my constituency of renovations going on, where available housing has been used for decanting, where justifiable evictions have taken place and caused homelessness because there was not another house to move into. That was the point being made from this side of the Committee. We were concerned purely with the dangers of creating homelessness.

Although subsection (3) could cover that sort of thing, its whole emphasis is towards rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties, which would not include the question whether somebody had accommodation, because that cannot be described as a right, obligation or liability in strict legal terms.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 75, in page 34, line 45, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'but the principle on which the amount shall be based shall be that local authorities shall be fully compensated for revenues lost to them in consequence of the counter-inflation orders .</p></blockquote>
I have great pleasure in moving the amendment, because I believe that the clause is irrelevant to the purposes set out in the rest of the Bill. It sticks out like a sore thumb. It will do nothing to improve housing conditions in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we understand the reasons for the clause and recognise that to remove it now would be unfair and probably impracticable. But perhaps the Minister will say whether it is the Government's intention to retain the rent freeze after December. I understand the Secretary of State has announced that he will compensate local authorities for up to 80 per cent. of the revenue lost as a result of the implementation of the clause, the balance to be met by ratepayers. Ratepayers are bearing an intolerable burden already. The rate support grant did not recognise the cost of reorganisation of local government in Scotland as it did in England. That is only one of the reasons why there will be frightening rises in rates in Scotland. Unlike rent increases, rises in rates hit at every household in the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It therefore behoves us to ensure that the ratepayer does not have to pay for this arbitrary act of government. That object will be satisfactorily achieved if the hon. Gentleman accepts the amendment. A vote against it would be a vote for higher rates, which I am sure no hon. Member present wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot recommend the Committee to accept the amendment. The whole question of the rent freeze has already been debated at considerable length, although not in the Committee. It would not be right for me to go over the whole of the ground. But I should like to make the general point that the rent freeze was and is an important part of the Government's attack on the rising cost of living. In any case, what we were doing was preventing rent increases from taking place, not because the local authorities wished them to take place but because they were to happen as a result of the previous Government's deliberate policy to impose rent increases on local authority tenants whether or not the local authority wished those rent increases to be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the local authorities in Scotland were very much against the previous Government's decision to arrogate to themselves decisions about rent levels which had previously been rightly considered by local authorities to be an important part of their housing function. It is for that reason that the rent freeze has been widely welcomed by not only tenants but local authorities. Although Conservative Members have tried to make an issue out of the matter, only one local authority, as far as I know, has made a complaint about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides for the amount of the rent income subsidy to be determined by the Secretary of State. That is to be done by means of an order. We have already announced that, when the order is introduced, at least 80 per cent. of the loss in rent income will be made good to the local authorities concerned. That will happen on a basis that provides that the reimbursement of the local authorities is directly calculated on the loss of income by the local authorities specifically, so that there is no question of the subsidy being distributed on a formula basis which might be more favourable to one local authority than another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a case like this, it seems to me right that there should be some sharing of the burden by Government and local authorities. The figure I have mentioned—at least 80 per cent. to be borne by the Government—seems to me to be a very fair offer to the local authorities concerned. It is roughly the same as the figure in England and Wales under rather different
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
housing subsidy arrangements. The English subsidy arrangements will provide for compensation for the local authorities automatically through the normal arrangements for assisting local authorities in England and Wales, although those arrangements will not provide an automatic reimbursement at a particular percentage for each individual authority. The percentage is likely to vary between one authority and another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 80 per cent. reimbursement in Scotland will produce a result for Scotland which will be exactly the same, as far as one can make it, as what will happen in England and Wales. A further point as regards England and Wales is that the normal rate support grant arrangements there attract grant for deficits on housing accounts. That does not happen in Scotland, because our rate support grant arrangements are rather different. Therefore, if there is a further rate support grant increase order for England and Wales later this year there is likely to be further reimbursement for English local authorities for the loss of income resulting from the rent freeze. If that happens—and all this is something about which we cannot be absolutely firm now—there will be a corresponding adjustment to the situation in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The percentage will certainly be 80 per cent., and it could be more, perhaps appreciably more. In all the circumstances, that is very fair to local authorities; and, therefore, I cannot recommend the Committee to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I might make one additional point. Under the counter-inflation legislation of the previous administration, there was also what might be called a rent freeze for a period. A number of local authorities in Scotland were prevented from putting up their rents between November 1972 and April 1973. No doubt the tenants were delighted with what the Government did. But the unfortunate authorities concerned must have considered themselves doubly unfortunate because they did not get a penny reimbursement from the then Government. This Government have acted a good deal more generously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not altogether surprised, though I am obviously disappointed at the Minister's attitude
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
What is particularly depressing is the total failure on the Minister's part to provide reasons why the total amount should not be reimbursed by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Housing (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Act was not a remarkable measure in the way that rent increases were imposed. However, the order under the counter-inflation legislation is in no way discretionary. Irrespective of whether a local authority wishes to increase its rents, no rent increases are allowed. In those circumstances, that Act is irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here, the local authorities having estimated for a certain amount of revenue and having based their last rate demands on that estimate now find that their income will be considerably less than they were entitled to believe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister suggested that the Government had committed themselves to providing 80 per cent. of the increase and that the burden must therefore be shared between central government and local government. What he has not said is why it should be shared by central government and local government. The concept of sharing the burden implies that those living in council rented properties are the most needy section of the community. As the result of these proposals, there will almost certainly be rate increases even beyond those necessary as a result of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now in a position where the community in Scotland will have to accept this burden. Does the Minister suggest that the community living in older properties in city centres and areas not covered by local authority property are in a position to help give financial benefit to council tenants? If the Government feel bound to have some form of control over rent increases, it is they who take that decision; and surely it should be the Government who pay for the resulting financial consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friends will vote on this amendment, because it is a very important one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to put two detailed questions to the Minister. First, what is the position in Glasgow? We know that Glasgow has a fifth of Scotland's population and its housing situation is alleged to be the most serious one. Here we have provision for
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
the Government to make good some of the money lost by local authorities. Bearing in mind what Glasgow housing convenor said last week, we have to know the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rent freeze started on 8th March. It is to end on 31st December. Every local authority in Scotland should have had a rent increase in October. But Glasgow does not have one due in October because it failed initially to implement the Government's Housing Act. As a result, Glasgow is three months behind everyone else. On the basis of the Government's freeze order, Glasgow tenants get nothing from it because they do not have any rent increase due between 8th March and 31st December.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the effect of this clause on Glasgow? Will it get any compensation? Under the clause, is the Minister planning to give anything to Glasgow? Will it lose anything? Will it gain anything? What will be the effect on the Glasgow ratepayer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a state of total confusion. We have a local authority which is three months behind and which, on the basis of the regulations, should not be affected. Will Glasgow tenants and ratepayers have a much heavier burden simply because their councillors delayed implementing the previous administration's legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that there may be legal disputes between the Government and the local authority, but the situation is such that the Glasgow ratepayer is entitled to some indication from the Minister of the facts of the case. If we are to give a great deal of money under Clause 45, will Glasgow get anything?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will the local authority be under an obligation to put up its rents in January?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see the danger of a real rates emergency. People are terrified about inflation. They believe that it is getting out of control. Rates have always been an intolerable burden in some parts of Scotland. But ratepayers are genuinely alarmed that the increases this year will break all records.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under their 80 per cent., the Government propose that most tenants will gain something. They will pay a little more in rates, but they will have a rent freeze. But those who are not affected by the rent freeze gain nothing from it and will have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
to pay more. Under this clause, unamended, we are saying that some will have to pay more in a situation in which the Government say that there is a crisis of inflation which needs to be dealt with. That is quite unfair unless there is additional compensation from our taxes to those local authorities which have been deprived of this cash. If we do not do this, we shall inflict a further burden on ratepayers in Scotland, who will really be hammered this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister's references to England were relevant in view of the fact that we are discussing the Housing (Scotland) Bill. The impact of revenue losses on the Scottish rates is much greater because of our very much larger proportion of local authority houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed that the Minister did not answer the question about what will happen after December. I support my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) when he says that we believe that it is necessary now for local authorities to be given guidance on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said encouragingly that the amount of support could be more than 80 per cent. If that is the case, why not accept the amendment and ensure that it is precisely 100 per cent.? It is shameful that the figure has not been finally decided so that local authorities may budget and decide what to do about their rate situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I wish that Ministers would stop lecturing me about the previous Government. They will recall that it was only gerrymandering by the Minister's hon. Friend which prevented my being here in 1970 to encourage the then Government into better ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not accuse the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson) of being responsible for anything done under the previous administration. However, one or two hon. Members on the Opposition benches bear a certain measure of responsibility because they were here supporting all the iniquitous provisions of various pieces of legislation produced by that Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pent-lands (Mr. Rifkind) asked why the burden should be shared. It is an interesting philosophical point. I can best answer it by
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
saying that it is simply because it is long precedented in housing subsidy and housing financial legislation that there should be some sharing of the burden between central government and local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the previous administration introduced their Housing (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Bill and imposed a national rent rebate scheme on local authorities, they paid a share of the rent rebates and expected the local authorities to pay a share as well. When that same administration, with universal approval. introduced a rent allowance scheme for private tenants, a percentage of it was borne by central government—I think 80 per cent.—and the remaining 20 per cent. was borne by the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these matters, the Government were introducing statutory obligations on local authorities. At the same time, they did not bear 100 per cent. of the burden. There is no difference in principle between what happened on those occasions and what is happening under this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a basic difference in that at present the whole purpose of these restrictions is to be part of counterinflationary measures, and there is something absurd in introducing such measures to assist one section of the community which impose exceptionally increased pressures on the remainder of the population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The previous administration used the same argument in connection with the 1972 Act. They said that they wanted to put up local authority rents but that, because of counter-inflationary considerations, they intended to introduce a rebate scheme to see that the inflationary effects were modified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments are the same with this provision as those that the then Government used with the previous provision, so that the principle of having the burden shared in this way, with the bulk of the money coming from the Government, is well precedented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) said. We are facing a serious situation over rates in the current year. I understand that we shall have an opportunity to discuss this at some length when we consider the Estimates in the next two weeks or so. For that reason, I forbear at the moment from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
attributing the proper share of responsibility for the present serious situation which falls upon the previous administration. It is a serious situation, and I accept that, but it does not seem substantially to change my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the Glasgow position, the rent income subsidy will be attributed directly to the loss of rental income, as I said originally. If an authority does not lose from the rent freeze, it can hardly expect to get money from the Government to compensate it. I will get 80 per cent. of nil if its loss is. nil. That seems perfectly reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart asked what was to happen after 31st December 1974. The Government hope to announce quite soon their proposals for housing finance beyond 31st December 1974. When we make these proposals known, they will be seen to go wider than questions of the rent freeze. We shall deal with the situation beyond 31st December 1974, and it will then be clear whether the provisions relate to Glasgow or anywhere else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided</i>: Ayes 8, Noes 8.</p>

	<p>in this clause. The definition as it appears in the Bill at present excludes
	<br><blockquote><p>"any yard, garden, outhouse or other pertinents belonging to the house or usually enjoyed therewith".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>It therefore confines the definition of "house" to within the four walls of the house, excluding the yard, the garden and the rest. The definition was included under Part I of the Bill because we are dealing basically with the house internally and we wished to exclude from Part I items such as the garden or yard which are much more relevant to amenity or environmental improvement, and there are other statutory provisions dealing with such improvements under the 1969 Act.</p>

	<p>However, in including the definition we have now found that we have perhaps
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
made it too restrictive because there are certain works outside a house—for example, the provision of a septic tank, which we would want to have included within the improvement provisions of Part I of the Bill. Therefore, we wish to remove the definition because it might be unnecessarily restrictive.</p>

	<p>The kind of improvement at which we aim under the Bill can be done not by a restrictive definition in the Bill but by guidance to local authorities, and I therefore want to remove the definition from the Bill.</p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three reasons for moving this new clause. The first is to insure against irresponsible designation of housing action areas by a local authority and to ensure that where a local authority is designating an area it has regard to the sense of priority in relation to the resources available to implement the proposal. Secondly, where housing action
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
areas have been defined, the new clause will help ensure energetic implementation of the proposals. The third reason—an important one—is that often in cases where action is required by the Bill, properties could be affected seriously by planning blight if there were long delays between initiation and implementation of proposals. We want to protect property owners against planning blight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot recommend the Committee to accept this new clause, although I appreciate the reasons behind it. It is necessary to ensure that once a final resolution has been passed the local authority gets on with the job, and I do not believe that the way to do that is to have a power by the Secretary of State to call for a report on what has happened and, if sufficient has not happened, to try to rescind everything that has been done from the start. Apart from anything else, that would be completely impracticable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I give an assurance that we shall wish local authorities, when given powers, to proceed with all due expedition. When the final resolution has been passed and the proposals are then to be implemented, the local authority is under an obligation. It is not then a matter of the local authority deciding whether to proceed depending on how it feels at the time. It has taken on a specific obligation and duty to see that the houses defined in the housing action area are dealt with in accordance with the terms of the resolution. Therefore, the local authority will have to get on with the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the local authority has an obligation directly imposed by statute, or through some action of its own, the default powers available to the Secretary of State are then open to him so that he can ensure that the local authority carries out its obligation. These default powers are in existing housing legislation and will be fully available to the Secretary of State to use under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. Gentleman wants to ensure will already be ensured under the existing legislation and the Secretary of State will keep watch to see that things go ahead, and if necessary use the default powers. That is a much better way to proceed than to attempt to set the clock back, which would be hopeless. There could be a situation in which part of the job had been done and part of it not done,

This is a sentiment which we have expressed in various amendments in the Committee. We are suggesting that we should try to preserve communities, not just houses. It is important if, as a consequence of housing action areas proposals, people have to be moved from their homes, that we should try to take reasonable steps to rehouse them in the same area. This would prevent a lot of unhappiness. I hope that the Minister can at least indicate that he agrees with the sentiments, even if the new clause is not properly drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a good deal of sympathy with this clause, provided we look at it on the basis that it is what the tenants and owners want.

	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
been displaced but which will, in fact, encourage a local authority to deal with those people more unfavourably than at present. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) made the point earlier this morning that people displaced in Glasgow for whatever reasons—roadworks, closure of houses, or demolition —by and large get far more favourable treatment than people on the ordinary waiting list. That is basically right because there is an element of compulsion involved, but it means that people on the ordinary housing list are sometimes critical of the fact that they never seem to get what they want or go to the top of the list because the local authority always gives preference to people being displaced for compulsory reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must find a balance between those compulsorily displaced and the ordinary housing applicants. In my experience, people in Glasgow who are compulsorily displaced are treated more favourably than the ordinary housing applicants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal in the new clause would give an additional protection to tenants and owners who would be displaced. I am not against that in principle, because location of a house is an element of suitability which has to be taken into account, but is is difficult to get this exactly right. If the new clause is withdrawn I shall see whether I can include in an appropriate part of the Bill—perhaps even by way of a new clause, depending on what my study of the situation may suggest is best —a provision which will import the sort of idea which hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have put to me, but not at the same time producing a situation which in certain circumstances might give less right to tenants and owners and which would help a local authority which might wish to be cavalier in its attitude to people who had been displaced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that I would be able to get the balance absolutely right, but if the new clause is withdrawn I am willing to make a further effort, preferably on Report, but if not, an amendment could be put down in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>'(1) A local authority may also purchase by agreement privately let or vacant dwellings outwith housing action areas in order to secure—

	<p>
	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to see the clause added to the Bill so that local authorities are given explicit power to purchase privately let or empty dwellings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be useful to remind the Committee that in our election manifesto we said that the Labour Party believed that municipalisation was the only permanent way to deal with the privately rented sector. I believe that to be a fundamentally correct policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without doubt, most private landlords, especially in substandard areas, are under-capitalised. They have neither the skill nor the interest to carry out modernisation. We see this when we consider the uptake in improvement grants. The picture shows that less than 5 per cent. of all improvement grants are taken up by private landlords, despite the fact that the privately rented sector contains the great bulk of substandard houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many private landlords are selling their properties to developers who turn out the tenants, improve the properties, and then sell to owner-occupiers. I do not object to that as such, but in certain areas it is creating a serious localised shortage of houses for rent. This is affecting people who have lived in these areas for many years, particularly the elderly who have long lived in our city centres and cannot be expected to become owner-occupiers. This also
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
applies to night shift workers who need to be near railways, the post offices and city centres. They, too, in many instances cannot afford to become owner-occupiers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is important to give local authorities the right to intervene, first, to give an impetus to improvement, which is lacking at the moment, and, secondly, to preserve the rented sector within our city centres. I know that local authorities have considerable compulsory purchase powers within housing action areas. However, there are large areas in city centres which are not intolerable, which would not justify housing action area orders on the basis of the Bill, but which are substandard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A major criticism of the Bill has been that it does not give local authorities discretion to create housing action areas on the grounds of social and environmental considerations in the way outlined in the English Bill. I submit that the new clause goes some way towards meeting this situation. It takes account of social, environmental and management considerations. It does not give local authorities the right to declare housing action areas on that basis, but it gives them fairly considerable powers to intervene in areas where they would not be able to maintain housing action area orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that my hon. Friend may say that this is not the correct Bill in which to bring forward such a measure. He may say that this Bill is concerned primarily with slum housing and that we ought to await further legislation. If he can assure me that the Government have this matter under active review and are seriously considering bringing forward legislation that will deal with the privately rented sector in the not too distant future, I must be patient and await that legislation. However, if the Government are not actively considering the matter, I must press the clause in what may be my own only opportunity within the foreseeable future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an outrageous speech, and the clause is outrageous. I hope that if there is to be a vote on it, the Committee will vote against it and fling it out of the window with some of the other wild ideas we are hearing from Leftist extremists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand how the clause, which seeks to give total powers of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0088">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
municipalisation of all rented property to local authorities, has any place in a Bill dealing with housing action areas. No doubt it has a connected purpose. If the clause is accepted, I am sure that my hon. Friends, who have other ideas on housing, will put down some exciting and interesting new clauses for future Housing Bills. The hon. Gentleman, in suggesting that municipalisation of privately rented property will solve our housing ills, must be living in cloud cuckoo land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would ask him to go round some areas where local authorities have not only taken over the houses, but have built, planned and are managing them.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that one difficulty with these municipal estates is that they are entirely municipal with no mixture of housing tenure? The purpose of the clause is to preserve a mixture of housing tenure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the houses in the hon Gentleman's constituency had been taken over by the Glasgow Corporation, we would not have had the problem of rents being increased by 800 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is bringing in a subject outwith the Bill. He knows that the increase of 800 per cent. in my constituency did not result from a Tory Bill, but from a Labour Bill voted for by every Labour Member in 1969. I should be glad to go into this matter with him in detail, but he knows that it was the direct consequence of splendid Socialist legislation for which his hon. Friends, who are trumpeting for more Socialist legislation, gladly voted. The trouble is that Socialist Members rarely know what they are doing. However, I hope that they will know what they are
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
doing when they chuck out this clause completely. Until local authorities can provide satisfactory, reasonable and proper housing for their tenants, let them not try to extend their empires. If anyone has an empire which he cannot control, he should not want a further empire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could argue for hours, but I do not believe that the arguments about municipalisation and nationalisation are for this Bill. I hope that the Committee will register its strong protest at this outragous clause and the scandalous speech of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Cook) by not accepting it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of those provocative remarks, I thought that some of my hon. Friends might have been stimulated to rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Cook) made a reasonable speech in support of the clause. However, I am afraid that I cannot recommend its acceptance. It would go beyond the general intention of the Bill. In particular, subsection (2) would attract the compulsory acquisition procedures as well as the purchase by agreement procedures provided in subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what my hon. Friend has said about the need to look at housing improvements on a wide basis. I do not suggest that there would not be instances when it would not be reasonable for a local authority to buy housing outside a housing action area. Indeed, this is provided for in existing housing legislation, and specifically in earlier clauses of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the circumstances that attract the compulsory procedures are defined as being for the purposes of housing action areas. The clause would provide for something so wide and ill-defined that it would attract compulsory acquisition procedures beyond the normal purposes of housing action areas. For that reason, I could not recommend that it be added to the Bill.

	<p>burgh, Central (Mr. Cook) a few moments ago.</p>

	<p>However, Sir Myer, we appreciate your chairmanship because you represent a Scottish constituency and you know about housing, and when we put forward amendments, you know what we are talking about. We greatly appreciate the patience you have demonstrated on the few occasions we have run into difficulties and we appreciate, too, the courteous way in which you have dealt with our points.</p>

	<p>Your chairmanship has been largely responsible for creating a situation in which the Bill has been considerably improved. For example, we have heard from three of my hon. Friends amendments leading to major concessions from the Government. First, my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Henderson) secured a major concession that grants would be paid within one month. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) had two major amendments accepted, one of them to speed up the procedure for housing action areas. Today, my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Ancram) managed to get two amendments accepted, one to control slum landlords and the other to safeguard the rights of tenants in housing action areas.</p>

	<p>We feel proud that the Committee has achieved this under your chairmanship, Sir Myer. It is yet another indication of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
how unfortunate it is that some hon Members do not regard the work of this Committee as important or helpful to Scotland. These major advances in the Committee are an indication of what can be achieved by our hard, plodding work. It is highly regrettable that we have still had no official indication from the minority parties in Scotland that they will play a part in future Bills in our Committees. I am shocked by that. In view of the major advances "achieved by my hon. Friends, I shall harry those hon. Members until we have a clear indication that they will come to the Committee, listen and study, and play their part in helping Scotland.</p>
