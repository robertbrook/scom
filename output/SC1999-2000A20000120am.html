	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is wonderful at this point to be able to help the Government to handle their business. As I was
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
saying in our previous sitting, I try to be helpful to Ministers whenever possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that right hon. and hon. Members have already read the 
	<i>Official Report</i> of the proceedings and will test me to ensure that I have understood where we have reached, but let me help those who have not yet managed to do so. We were discussing, as you rightly said, Mr. Hood, new clause 1, which is about access rights for the Comptroller and Auditor General to various public sector bodies. New clause 1, tabled by the Public Accounts Committee, seeks to extend the National Audit Office's jurisdiction to all public sector bodies, particularly non-departmental Government bodies that are not currently audited by the NAO, and, among other things, to change the phraseology in the Bill with respect to the way in which the NAO gets to see the papers that it requires. At present, the Government propose that it should be a duty on the Department to give access to the NAO. Under the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866, the National Audit Office had the right to demand access, and new clause 1 seeks to reinstate that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my remarks on Tuesday evening, I was wondering whether the Government could take time out to consult on the implications of extending the Comptroller and Auditor General's jurisdiction, as I thought it rather odd that all parties in the Committee were in favour of extending the NAO's jurisdiction. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, in his evidence to the PAC last week, made it crystal clear that he was extremely sympathetic to that view. His only concern was whether this was the right Bill in which to do it and whether the Government would have time to consult. In my final remarks on Tuesday evening, I said that I believed that there was time for the Government to undertake the necessary consultation, primarily because we understand that there is such consensus—among the NAO, the Treasury and Parliament. Therefore, consultation would surely not be difficult or controversial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To some extent I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there is a need for a good deal more discussion about these issues before we are certain how to proceed, but does he agree with the point made by the Conservative spokesman, the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), that new clause 1 would allow the NAO access to the accounts of any firm operating the working families tax credit? If that were the effect of the new clause, does he believe that it would be a good thing? Certainly, those of us who are concerned about burdens on business would be worried if that were the effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>9 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note with interest the Financial Secretary's intervention. In fact, I was not dealing with any of the points that he raises, but I shall answer them nevertheless. Obviously, the Government have been stung by reports in today's newspapers that, according to the British Chambers of Commerce, various other legislative measures have increased the regulatory burden on business by billions of pounds. Perhaps that is the BCC's first counter-attack.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
Like the Financial Secretary, I am unsure about the suggestion by the hon. Member for West Dorset that the NAO should have rights to every private firm. He and I have already had a written dialogue on that very point, but I am happy to discuss the suggestion further and would not rule it out completely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Davis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Haltemprice and Howden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the Financial Secretary's benefit, let us put the subject in context. The new clause would entitle the NAO to access areas that the Government have entitled themselves to access. I suspect that the relevant sampling rate would be, at best, one in 1,000. Therefore, for every pound of burden that the NAO might impose on the private sector, the Government would impose £1,000, or perhaps £1 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has far greater knowledge and experience of this issue, and I am grateful for his intervention. Does he or the Financial Secretary agree that the Inland Revenue was given significant powers with regard to the operation of the working families tax credit? A major criticism of the proposal was the Revenue's power to check on fraud. When a similar tax credit operated in the United States, fraud was a significant issue. The Treasury did not want the same problem to arise here because one of its flagship policies would thereby have been scuppered. Therefore, draconian powers were granted to the tax authorities to ensure that the tax credit was not being abused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, we had a written dialogue during a previous sitting, and since then I have looked into the matter. The Financial Secretary's predecessor, and his erstwhile colleague, the former Paymaster General, ensured that the Inland Revenue's powers to pursue fraud in relation to the WFTC exceeded those of any other Department in British history. The Revenue has unfettered discretion to do whatever it chooses. All that we seek is the right for the NAO to conduct dipstick checks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that this interesting exchange does not directly relate to new clause 1, so if I am not careful, Mr. Hood, you will rule me out of order. None the less, all members of the Committee are grateful to the Financial Secretary for raising the matter. Perhaps that is this morning's first example of an own goal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the issue, which Ministers raised, of whether there will be time during the Bill's passage to discuss the merits of extending the institutional jurisdiction of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Perhaps we can draw a parallel from other consultation exercises that the Government have undertaken. Were I to pursue this matter too far, Mr. Hood, you would certainly rule me out of order, but I direct Committee members' attention to the consultation exercise that the Government undertook on electoral arrangements for the Greater London Authority, and in particular the question of election limits. Proposals were published just before the Christmas recess, and a final submission date was set for early January.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We should not be discussing the Greater London Authority elections. I must ask the hon. Gentleman to direct his comments to the matter before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hood. I thought that you might bring me to order. You are quite right to do so, and I shall obey your instructions. May I just make the point that the Government consulted on that issue for a very short period while the House was in recess during the Christmas break? They felt that that was sufficient consultation on election arrangements. On a parallel with that, they could easily consult all the bodies that Share a consensus on these issues during the next few weeks. That is clearly possible, given the Government's track record on other, more contentious, issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to answer that point in detail. Why cannot the Government consult to meet the aims to which they claim to be sympathetic while the Bill is before us? As other hon. Members have said, it is unlikely that we shall have the chance to pass such legislation again for many years. If the Government duck the issue this time, they will have lost an important opportunity to do what they say that they want to do. If, however, they do not intend to consult while the Bill is before the House, when will they do so? What are their plans? They say that they want to do so, and that they agree with the idea. That is reassuring but not good enough. We want concrete details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are asking the Committee to take their word for it and to refrain from pressing the amendments and from encouraging Members in the other place to table similar amendments, why can they not set out how and when they plan to carry out the measures that should be implemented by the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government were to publish a consultation paper, introduce a short Bill and try to get it through the House with all-party support during this Session, that Bill would have a rapid passage both here and in the other place. However, if they are not prepared to say when they will consult, or when they would be likely to legislate, it will be our job to prevent such an easy passage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To emphasise that point, I shall read the answer—already referred to in our proceedings—given by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to the PAC, when he was asked about consultation, and about the issues on which he thought that consultation was necessary. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think there are a lot of other considerations that have to be weighed very carefully. We have to be satisfied that the changes were actually required in practice, that there was no costly duplication of effort, of scrutiny and audit, that there were not any down side effects on existing arrangements that were working satisfactorily. We would need to be satisfied about the effect on service providers, on business. We would have to take account of the regulatory burden that might be imposed and we would have to be satisfied that the changes would provide satisfactory audit… You would have to look at the relationship with the Audit Commission certainly and the relationship with the new statistics commission."</p></blockquote>
That sounds like Sir Humphrey. It does not sound like a Minister giving genuine political reasons that we can accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>215</span>
All the issues that the Minister raised could be countered by our saying, "If you believe us, and you are sympathetic to ensuring that the NAO can look at all those Departments, many of those points are trivial." If the Government will accept that position in principle, the principle would override many of those minor concerns. I am sure that a short period of consultation would result in a response from all the bodies concerned that the theoretical problems that the Government are suggesting have little substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Government to put their money where their mouth is. If they believe that they have shown in practice, since they came to power in 1997, that non-departmental public bodies should have the NAO as their auditor, the Comptroller and Auditor General should be given access to their books. That is the way in which the Government have behaved elsewhere since 1997, so why do they not take this chance to get all non-departmental public bodies thus administered and audited? If they were to undertake the necessary consultation for such a measure and get it on to the statute book, that would command huge support in the House and outside. I believe that that could be done efficiently and in good order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Williams 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start with two apologies. First, members of the Committee may have noticed that I was not present for last Tuesday Morning's sitting; I had to attend an important Privileges Committee hearing. Secondly, I intend to speak for somewhat longer than usual, because I want to respond to the points that the Economic Secretary made. A clear confrontation of the arguments is important so that the Committee can make its decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the pressure that some of my hon. Friends are under. It is difficult to vote against one's own party because one believes that although it is winning the arguments, one has to vote in accordance with one's conscience. I ask those who have doubts about the Government's position to do Ministers the good service of telling them about those doubts in private. Perhaps Ministers will then appreciate that the arguments are not entirely one way, as Treasury officials appear to believe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final introductory comment is that new clause 1 is linked to clause stand part. A vote in favour of the clause standing part would inevitably be a vote against the new clause, which would fall because it is intended to replace the clause. The Whip will understand that my hon. Friends must take their own decisions about supporting the PAC amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said to the hon. Member for West Dorset outside the Room, I have already been made to suffer one of the greatest disadvantages that can befall a member of the parliamentary Labour party—I have been excommunicated from my bleeper. However, I am not easily intimidated, and will try to address some of the serious points that the Economic Secretary raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start with the nub of the argument, which is the central point of the collision of ideas between members of the PAC and those who brief the Treasury. Our debates keep harking back to 1866, and the Economic
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
Secretary said that we are now dealing with different questions from Gladstone's time. She is utterly wrong, as the Treasury knows. The machinery is different, but the questions remain absolutely the same. The Public Accounts Committee and what is now the National Audit Office were set up at a time of high corruption, profligate waste and public sleaze.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Issues do not go away. All that one can do is try to control them, and if they are not controlled properly, they get out of hand. They cannot be defeated by one good action by the Government or the National Audit Office. It is a continuing battle—essentially, as I hope to demonstrate, the same battle as in Gladstone's time. Gladstone's solution was to set up a monitoring system to scrutinise those who were profligate, wasteful or fraudulent, and to ensure that the public understood what was being done by those who purported to represent them. Such issues in Department after Department are still considered twice a week by the Public Accounts Committee. Depressingly, the same problems often recur in the same Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that as we are not in Gladstone's age, we can leave more and more to Departments, but fraud is corrosive and it spreads. We considered a case not long ago involving one of the most senior Inland Revenue investigators, who is now languishing in prison. That investigator was so good at his job and got such good results in big cases that his seniors turned a blind eye to the fact that he was fiddling expenses. Word went around the department that a blind eye was being turned to the fiddling of expenses, so others started massaging their expenses. Such issues are, sadly, recurrent and Parliament's job is to boot them out whenever possible. The governmental machine is answerable to the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the proposition that Departments can be relied on. Many years ago, I started a campaign when I discovered that Departments held files marked, "Not for NAO eyes." I tabled questions to every Department asking how many files they held that were not for NAO eyes. I wish that I could find my file—it is somewhere in the archives—but there were hundreds. Only one Department had none. If innocent officials in those Departments were anxious, desperate and committed to complying with the standards required by the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office, why did files need to be so marked? Such files no longer exist, because I suggested to the National Audit Office during a closed sitting that files marked "Not for NAO eyes" were as accessible to it as any other Government document and that the best solution might be to ask for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggested that that would save a lot of time and pinpoint what was wrong in the Department. No such files remain, officially, but a question arises about the commitment that the Minister loyally believes, exists throughout the civil service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister believes that we can rely on Departments to get things right. The PAC held a hearing on Forward Catering, which used to provide £3 million of catering throughout the civil service and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>217</span>
was about to be privatised. An entrepreneur was running it and we discovered that accounts had gone walkabout in three regions. Ghost workers were employed; they worked in one name in the morning and another in the afternoon to avoid national insurance contributions. The head of that powerful public body, with his deputy and one of their wives and daughters, secretly set up a private company, which made a bid in complete conflict of interest, without notifying his Permanent Secretary and accounting officer. In the process, he entered into three contracts, none of which went out to tender, and all of which breached the rules of his organisation, the Treasury and the European Economic Community. He did things on a grand scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The upshot was that the national insurance fund was defrauded of £250,000. Which Department was that gentleman in? The Treasury. Therefore, those who tell us not only that the Departments keep an eye on everything, but that an eye is kept on the Departments, had, in their own Department, a happy little group plotting a highly profitable privatisation of a public asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Departments are so reliable, we should consider why there has been a series of scandals involving the Welsh Office. In terms of monitoring and accountability, the Welsh Development Agency provides a lovely little cameo, which, if it were fiction, would make people laugh. The NAO found that WDA directors had given themselves free cars—which was strictly outside Treasury and departmental rules—for official and private use. They had also introduced redundancy payments that were outside departmental rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those transgressions did not involve massive sums of money, but, interestingly, when the report was published, a parliamentary colleague from Cardiff told me and my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells), who is now Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs, that there were civil servants in the Welsh Office who wanted to talk to us, but who were afraid to meet us in Cardiff because they did not dare to be seen with us before the Public Accounts Committee hearing. We met them in—I think—Room W4, or one of the W Rooms, where they unveiled Operation Wizard. It was a scheme devised by the WDA directors to investigate the possibility of privatising its two most profitable parts—consultancy and property. As they did not want to push the price up, there are no WDA minutes to tell us that Wizard existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although people knew what was happening, they were terrified to do anything about it. One departmental head allegedly kept copies of internal documents in his attic, in case he needed them for his own protection later. The WDA directors commissioned three feasibility studies into the possibility of privatisation. However, they knew that the NAO would look at their books, and, because those studies were not for NAO eyes, they were renamed and farmed out to improbable divisions within the WDA. Not even the NAO was able to
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
detect the existence of Wizard. Under subsequent changes, those whistleblowers could go to the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is an accredited contact, only if he was responsible for auditing that body. How could that happen, and what was the Welsh Office doing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was one of three scandals that occurred. I have a high regard for the new Permanent Secretary in the Welsh Office, Mr. Scholar, who had come from the Treasury. He had to pick up the mess that someone else had left. PAC investigations often find that, because those who make a mess often get away before its hearings begin. I asked him, "How many people in the Welsh Office monitor quangos?" There are between 40 and 80 such quangos. He said, "Our monitoring amounts to the equivalent of two man-hour years. Two officials monitor all the Welsh Office's responsibilities." That does not fit in with the advice that the Economic Secretary quoted earlier from the Treasury about the competence of Departments to look after their own affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On defence, I spent a year working on Gulf war shipping contracts. I received help from the shipping industry, and I gave relevant documents to the NAO. I discovered that, during the Gulf war, the Ministry of Defence spent about £150 million—that is a ballpark figure because I do not remember the exact figure—on shipping contracts to get troops and weaponry, for example, to the war zone. That was done through a private broker. The British shippers were squeezed out: they got only five contracts, and all the rest, including the major contracts, were picked up by five brokers who had close contacts with the Scandinavian shipping industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result of the investigation was that Hogg Robinson was sacked as the broker and a completely new system was introduced. I did not follow up on what happened—the police investigated the matter while our hearing was under way, but I lost track of developments after that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministry of Defence is one of our biggest spenders, and the Department of Health another. When Guy's hospital wanted to build a new extension, it put in a ludicrous and nonsensically low estimate. It bid about £25 million but ended up spending about £125 million once it had jumped the queue and had its project approved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Departments are not especially good at monitoring. Anyone who tells the Economic Secretary otherwise is in danger of accidentally misleading her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must inform my Front-Bench colleagues that, on the entrepreneurial side of this matter, I feel caught. I remember our election manifesto commitment to be prudent in public finance. The Chancellor likes to remind people constantly that that is crucial. I am surprised that so few of his officials read what he has said. Many people would say that taxpayers' money is not meant to be put at risk—that is not why they pay taxes. Let us look at the entrepreneurial capability that is being suppressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I come now to the pent-up entrepreneurs who are waiting to burst forth on the world—as long as they are using someone else's money. We had an example of that when Wessex health authority decided to computerise. It was a wonderful scheme: every doctor in the region was to be able to tap into every hospital and find out what was available. The health authority spent over £60 million on the scheme. It did not work. It was not the hare-brained scheme of a civil servant who did not understand these matters. The health authority chairman at the time was—if I remember correctly—ex-IBM, and is still one of the great and good whose name constantly appears in matters relating to government and industry. Nevertheless, £60 million was spent on a venture that was at the frontier information technology at the time, but did not work. It was very enterprising, but very
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
wasteful. If that £60 million had gone into providing health facilities in the region, it would probably have been much more welcomed by those living there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on Second Reading, within two weeks of us announcing the dates of the Public Accounts Committee hearing, the chairman of the West Midlands regional health authority unexpectedly took early retirement. NHS Executive representatives expressed great surprise at that at the Committee hearing. Contract problems were also involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Privatisation creates opportunities for many people, including those with insiders' information, and appropriate arm's length controls are needed. During the privatisation of rolling stock companies, one person invested £100,000 and made £15 million, another invested nothing other than insiders' know-how and made £15 million and a third invested £110,000 and made £35 million. The privatisation process was a good risk from the investors' point of view, but the public lost out hand over fist. I am sure that there are at least three keen advocates of the Treasury's proposal to have greater risks in the public sector. We are told that such issues mean that although we want to impose appropriate controls on those 80 bodies, that cannot be done—that they cannot be audited by the National Audit Commission. Would auditing inhibit risk-taking in such cases?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this context, we should also consider the traffic director for London, the British Film Institute, Food From Britain and the Museum of London, which is well known for its wild excesses in the museum world—I foresee problems arising in that regard, and we might need to have a full debate on it. I do not foresee many risks with the Crafts Council, unless it uses the alternative meaning of the word "craft"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting the right hon. Gentleman, who is making an entertaining speech. Might amendments be tabled in another place that would require an examination of each of the bodies that will be excluded by the Government, who are reluctant to accept new clause 1 and similar proposals? That might involve testing the Government's arguments in relation to each of those bodies and, in effect, doing the consultation job for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have anticipated the hon. Gentleman's needs. There are, I believe, 17 amendments on the Amendment Paper that would allow the Government to do what we have been told we should do: deal with the needs of each body in turn. We know what we want to do. If the Government do not agree with our proposals, they must explain why those bodies should be excluded from proper supervision. I hope that that dispenses with the argument about Departments being capable and good risk-takers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As politicians, we are interested in policy, but the NAO and the PAC deal not with policy but with administrative matters. If a Government decree that such and such is the policy, all that we can do is to try to ensure that it works effectively. It is not for us to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
judge whether that policy is right or wrong—that is the role of departmental Select Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one of our hearings, I told the Chief Secretary to the Treasury that there could not be people who were more firmly on his side. One approach is suggested in the Treasury briefing paper, but the Treasury also wants greater risks to be taken. It is pushing the private finance initiative on the ground that risks will be taken by the private sector. The private sector will be rewarded for taking the risks that the Treasury says Departments want to take. The Departments seem to be out of step with Government policy. The Government, sensibly, are willing, if they can, to pay an insurance premium to pass the risk on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The PFI will be a major element in the future, and in ensuring that it works one could not have better eyes than those of the Public Accounts Committee and the NAO. We will certainly make the necessary investigations to ensure that the PFI works in the interests of the terms that the Government have laid down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to some other points, which I promise to cover more quickly. The Minister said that the guidance on access by the NAO can be amended. However, that of course implies that it can also be reamended. There is no right for the NAO in amended guidance. Indeed, Treasury guidance is often just that—not mandatory. The Treasury is much more modest about its abilities than Ministers. Officials are always saying to the Public Accounts Committee, "It is not our job to monitor what Departments are doing and how they are spending their money. We send them the guidelines by which they should work, and we rely on them reading and implementing them." Guidance is an utterly inadequate substitute for statutory mandatory right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NAO has been allowed to report on the process of setting up PFI contracts, but is not allowed to monitor the on-going situation. We were able to examine the contracts for Fazakerly and Parc prisons, but we cannot investigate on an on-going basis the six private prisons that are working for the Prison Service—although we can go into any detail we wish in respect of the remainder of prisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax credit scare has already been dealt with by the Chairman of the PAC, the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr. Davis), but I must re-emphasise the point. The powers that we are asking for on behalf of the NAO are no different from those that the Government already have in respect of their Departments. I know whom I would sooner trust if I were a Minister. If Departments know that the NAO is watching what they do, they might be more diligent. They might say, "A sample of so and so would be okay, but if we expand it, the NAO will have no grounds for complaint." A small private business man would be no more exposed to interference and aggravation under our proposition than he would be under the Government's. Many such people would prefer to deal with a professional auditing institute or organisation rather than bureaucrats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the tax credit, my right hon.

Will he confirm that the Inland Revenue has access rights to the accounts of firms for tax purposes, but the NAO does not have such rights, and that new clause 1 would extend to the NAO access to the accounts of very many small firms?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am wrong, I bow to those who tabled the new clause, although it appears to have been very carefully conceived, in that it refers to a paying body and a receiving body, and would not extend the NAO's powers to the employer as a taxpayer. It would extend those powers only to the employer as an agent of the state in paying out moneys on the state's behalf That is thoroughly appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>9.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that helpful intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a love-hate relationship between the PAC and the Treasury. Treasury officials always attend PAC hearings and often give helpful advice. Where relevant, we can ask them questions, and, if we are lucky, we get answers, although I should point out that in fact we usually do. However, in respect of the rights of the House of Commons, the PAC regards the Treasury as a hostile element. It is astonishing that, after seven months, the Treasury did not bother to reply to a letter from the National Audit Office that explained the provision that it wanted to incorporate into the Bill. By way of defence, the Treasury argued that the letter did not specify that the NAO wanted a reply. I note that even the Financial Secretary has the charm to smile at such an argument, which, I realise, he would not have advanced himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Ministers are always heavily dependent on advice from officials. We all remember the Crosland adage that it takes a Minister six months to read into a new Department, and, unless one has held a senior post in opposition, that is certainly true. According to the Chief Secretary, the PAC's provision cannot be incorporated in the Bill because the long title does not allow for that. The long title states that this is a Bill
	<br><blockquote><p>"To make provision about government resources and accounts; to provide for financial assistance for a body established to participate in public-private partnerships; and for connected purposes."</p></blockquote>
Several clauses proceed to deal with auditing. Ministers were totally unprepared—I do not blame them—for our amendments because their officials had assured them that such amendments could not be tabled. A short conversation with the Clerk—such as the one that I duly had—would have established that such amendments were indeed in order. You, Mr. Hood, would not have allowed us to start our debate if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
you had had the slightest doubt that the amendments were in order, so that was not good advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it also correct that if the amendments had not been in order, large parts of the Bill would probably not have been in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. The long title is the last part of the Bill to be amended, so that it may encompass any changes that have been agreed by the Committee and deemed to be outside the original long title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were told that the 225 Government companies that have been set up are excluded because of a European Union directive. Countries such as Germany, France and Ireland are happy to allow their national accounting bodies to investigate and audit their public companies. That is happening in the majority of EU countries, but Ministers were told that it is inconceivable here. Ministers were told that that should not be in the Bill because it is not the intention of the Bill. The intention of a Bill is denned in the long title, and we have already shown—as you, Mr. Hood, and the Clerks have emphasised—that it would have been legitimate to read it as containing such an intention. When the Government wanted a vote in the House on the age of consent, they tacked it on to a Bill that was already being considered in the House. The long title allowed it. As the Chief Secretary said, there are numerous precedents for adding items to Bills as long as they are encompassed in the long title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Treasury must understand why the PAC exists; it is not stubbornness. It is effrontery for the Treasury to send out letters saying that witnesses should not be called out of retirement. When complaints are made, those who are responsible for things going wrong usually move on or retire before a hearing is held. It is lucky that we did not make a row about that at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that I have dealt with every argument advanced by Ministers—I hope adequately, although that is not for me to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final comment concerns the first one that I made on Second Reading. The Bill is not about auditing. There are about 4,000 accountable Government units—the national health service claims to have about 600—and there is no way in which the PAC, sitting 50 times a year, can monitor them all on behalf of the House. It can only scratch the surface and only because the NAO does the groundwork by synthesising the information and presenting the worst problems. We are discussing a wider matter. As I said on Second Reading, if ordinary citizens are lucky enough to live to the age of 80, their sole participation in parliamentary democracy will be 16 votes. We, as hon. Members, have certain privileges. That number of votes is what democracy means to the majority of people out there. It is not what I call democracy, or what most of us understand by the term. However, because we are here, so close to it, we often forget our role. In a representative democracy, there can be democracy only if those who rule the country—that is what Ministers and the Executive are there to do—are accountable to those who represent the country. All Members, including Ministers, represent the
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
electorate, and our job is to look after their interests. If we do not do so, no one else can. I am sorry to repeat myself—I am not very good at thinking up new phrases—but if democracy does not exist here in the House, it does not exist anywhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak again on this matter, But I shall be brief. I want to make three points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we have been privileged to witness a great parliamentary occasion, the effects of which will ricochet around the other place before eventually returning to this House, and may prove a determining factor in how the Bill emerges into law. The right hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) makes an overwhelming case, based on a quarter of a century's experience of these matters. No one listening to him with an open mind could fail to be convinced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to dwell on two points of detail that emerged from the right hon. Gentleman's speech, because there is a possibility that we are making progress. I hope that we have succeeded in persuading Ministers that there is no intention in the new clause to give the NAO a duplicative power to that of the Inland Revenue, which is far too discretionary. We are dealing not with private transactions in which the Inland Revenue can deal in an extraordinarily tyrannical way with someone who has, possibly, not paid his taxes. That is a separate issue and not within the scope of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with cases in which a firm, or an individual employer, is acting as an agent of the state in administering a de facto benefit. Whether that system is good or bad need not concern us. It is a system that the Government, in their wisdom, have chosen as the system of delivery of a benefit. It is a perfectly proper exercise of Government policy making. However, it means that we have to extend the scope of the activity of the NAO. Otherwise, we shall be accepting the precedent that each time that there is an extension of the delivery mechanism, there is a reduction in the scope of parliamentary accountability. That could reach a point at which almost all the Government's activities would be delivered through agencies other than Whitehall and the scope of parliamentary accountability would be reduced to a nugatory level. No one on the Committee would wish to see that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg the Financial Secretary to attend to this logic, because measures enshrined in statute have an enormously important precedent effect in Whitehall. I hope that Ministers will—not only as a result of this debate but as a matter of intellectual conviction—go back to the Treasury and persuade officials that they should give up that line of argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point of detail concerns the right of access. Ministers may, until this sitting, have been persuaded that the description of the right of access, or the duty to allow access, in clause 9—"A department shall allow"—was watertight. Ministers may have thought that, but they are wrong in statutory construction. That does not matter, because they have an opportunity to avoid the slightest doubt if they turn it into the contrapositive, as in the new clause, which states:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>225</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Comptroller and Auditor General shall have a right of access".</p></blockquote>
On Ministers' logic that the two are identical, they will lose nothing. Those of us who think that their statutory construction is wrong, however, will be satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have an opportunity to achieve what they say the clause achieves, although we do not believe that it does. That could be done unambiguously by changing the terms. I cannot see how that is anything other than an advance for all of us. We could stop quarrelling about genuine right of access or the gatekeeper function, and at least one major element of dissension would be removed. Ministers would merely achieve with certainty what they already believe that they have achieved. That is not the whole burden of our efforts, but, as the PAC put it, it would be a major advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that new clause 1 uses language from the 1866 Act, but the Government's proposals use completely different language? The Government have not tried to make a case for changing the language. Does he agree that unless they do, they should use the language of previous Acts that have served this country well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. No Committee member knows what reason the Government's legal advisers gave for making the change from the old wording to the new. It can only have been either that the new wording is a better way of expressing the same thing, or that it has the effect of diminishing rights of access. If the latter, Ministers have told us that that would conflict with their policy, so the changes should not be made. If the former, the Government should convince others that it is an improvement. Not only Members of Parliament are ganging up to make an argument—although it is significant that legislators representing many different parties, and, in the case of the PAC, none, read the clause differently. The National Audit Office and its legal advisers are too. If one set of lawyers, who are expert in such matters, argue that the ability of the NAO to obtain access will be diminished, while another set of lawyers argue the opposite, it cannot conceivably be described as an unambiguous improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to reassure the hon. Gentleman on one point. He suggests that there is a difference in the legal effect of two forms of wording. That in the Bill states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A department shall allow the Comptroller access at all reasonable times".</p></blockquote>
While new clause 1 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Comptroller and Auditor General shall have a right of access at all reasonable times".</p></blockquote>
There is no difference in the effect of those two forms of wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I think that the Minister is wrong. I feel confident that, after it has
	<span class='label label-info column'>226</span>
been considered in another place, this change will not be made. If it were made, however, we would know if the Minister were right only if the or matter came to the High Court or the House of Lords, as it would be challenged all the way. Ultimately, it would be a matter for judges to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think, that the Minister's advice is wrong. That is not only my judgment but that of the legal advisers of the body most directly concerned. Two highly paid sets of lawyers—one Government and one parliamentary—disagree. Therefore, he must admit that there is at least an ambiguity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Financial Secretary of the point that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) has just made: we are talking not about an alternative but about something that has stood the test of time since 1866. One of the phrases unambiguously, definitely and provably has a certain effect: access. The other, ambiguously and possibly, has an identical effect. If it is the Financial Secretary's policy to achieve the same effect, what can conceivable be the gain of making the change?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary is known to be one of the most intelligent Members of the House of Commons. This argument has nothing to do with party politics; it is a rational deduction. I believe that, if he considers the point, he will accept the argument. Once he has accepted it, we could get over many diversions, because they rest on the question of gatekeeperism. That was the main burden of the arguments of the right hon. Member for Swansea, West. Parliament and the public are not indifferent to whether there is a gatekeeper function. It is extraordinarily important that no such function should exist. It is fundamental to the operation of our democracy that Whitehall should not have the ability to close the doors on the NAO. Therefore, if there is the slightest ambiguity about the new phrase—as there is—Ministers, as parliamentarians, should be the first to ensure that that gate remains open. I hope that the Government will change their mind so that we can get on with all the other, much more contentious issues that we have been debating. That at least should be common ground between us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak again, but I made it clear at the outset that the Economic Secretary was badly advised and that, as a result, there was an inaccuracy, misunderstanding or misrepresentation in what she told the Committee—I am sure in each case inadvertently. I want to put that right on six different counts. I have some sympathy for the Economic Secretary, because, as the right hon. Member for Swansea, West said, she is dependent—as is the Financial Secretary—on her advisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point has already been talked about at some length by two Opposition spokesmen. The Economic Secretary's original reasoning for the clause, was that the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866 was unclear on how the CAG's access was to be enforced. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The clause … clarifies how access will be achieved."</p></blockquote>
There was always clarity about the 1866 Act and the CAG's access in Departments, although the clause
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>227</span>
deals with outside them as well. The access powers are directly invested in the CAG. Governments have never taken the CAG to court over such matters in 130 years, so the process is well established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt, as the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said, that the new clause provides no new powers for the CAG, just a requirement on the Departments to provide access. My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset said that if the Financial Secretary believes, contrary to the comments of the Economic Secretary, that clause 9 and new clause 1 are identical, we and the Comptroller and Auditor General would certainly prefer the original wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Economic Secretary said on Tuesday:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new clause would give the Comptroller and Auditor General virtually unlimited access to anyone receiving Government money … this is the intention of the clause."—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 18 January 2000; c.192–3.]</p></blockquote>
The Financial Secretary, who is, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset said, one of the cleverest men on the Government Benches, has walked into a mantrap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simple fact is that the Ministers are badly briefed by their advisers. There is deliberately not a right for the CAG to go anywhere that public money goes. I explained clearly that the new clause would provide access only where the Government had access already. As regards added burdens, there are two effects. One is a sampling effect—one in 1,000, or less. I shall make a promise to the Financial Secretary. If the new clause is agreed, the cost burden imposed by the CAG's involvement will be not only less than a 1,000th of that put on it by the Government, but significantly less than 1 per cent. of the fraud that will be implicit otherwise—indeed, it would help to reduce such fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point is this: the Economic Secretary said in column 193 that the new clause would provide access to devolved Administrations. Clause 9 was drafted some time ago and, as we heard from the right hon. Member for Swansea, West, has been with the Treasury for more than seven months. One reason for tabling new clause 1 was the feeling that at least the Treasury would be able to brief properly on this point if we did not change it. Therefore, we were working on the premise of a well established clause. If Treasury officials had talked to the NAO or answered the letters, this point might have been dealt with, because there is no intention to do so in the clause. However, the NAO's lawyers have suggested that an amendment to the clause using just seven words would address the issue. I say to Ministers that, if the clause is accepted, I would happily support that seven-word subsequent amendment on Report. Indeed, I would table it if they so wished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary also implied, in columns 195–6, that the NAO was happy with its guidance on access to contractors. That is not so. The latest guidance was issued following six years of negotiation with the Treasury on the circumstances in which access might be needed. Following the issue of that guidance, NAO officials wrote to the Treasury to say that they were unhappy that the guidance did
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
not suggest that a resumption of access would be needed in all cases, and that the Treasury had not agreed to legislate for a statutory power of access. That is on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then the Economic Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The general access for the CAG to Chessington"—</p></blockquote>
Chessington was the example that she used, so I shall use it—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is provided for in a free-standing agreement between the two".—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 18 January 2000; c.198.]</p></blockquote>
She said that, if there were any shortcomings in that agreement, the NAO had some responsibility. The NAO had to draw up that agreement precisely because the Treasury's preferred approach of 50 individual access clauses in 50 different contracts was seen as unworkable and unsuitable for the NAO's work with Chessington, which provides assurance across all Departments. The NAO's lawyers advise that a statutory right would be the only secure way in which the NAO could obtain the type of access that it needs at Chessington.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What my right hon. Friend has just said is very important. We are trying to understand what lies behind the Ministers' reluctance to accept that line of logic. Does my right hon. Friend agree that they must have the idea that the NAO and its lawyers are like a party on the other side of a negotiation or a body with which we have a conflict of interest and which is advancing some kind of special pleading? If that is the view of the NAO's lawyers, the whole of our parliamentary democracy has an interest in doing exactly what they want it to do, and not in trying to find a clever way of slightly resisting it, as if the NAO were a body that represented a foreign and hostile power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, that is correct. I have tried to stress along the way, when we have sometimes wandered into technical arguments, that we should never lose sight of the fact that the NAO is Parliament's auditor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other day my hon. Friend tried to adduce the reasoning behind this antagonism. I cannot remember whether the Economic Secretary was responding to him or making her original statement, but she advanced some extremely worrying arguments for such reasoning. Having sought to reassure us that the Treasury would always provide access when it was necessary—indeed, at one point she used the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"We all want to ensure that the NAO has access"—</p></blockquote>
she went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Hon. Members have underemphasised the impact of changes in audit on risk taking and innovation."</p></blockquote>
Then, even more worryingly, she said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The valuable role that auditing and the NAO play in public life by looking at our public expenditure needs to be balanced against the dangers of closing down innovation and risk taking in an appropriate measure."—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 18 January 2000; c. 196–200.]</p></blockquote>
She put both sides of the argument. She said, "We shall pretty much always give access", but argued that there was a strong reason not to give access to a bunch of risk suppressors from Parliament. That is worrying,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
because it is not clear whether the Government want to provide access or seek to restrict it. The fact that we will not be given any statutory rights or guarantees means, I am afraid, that we must assume the latter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset led me to a side issue. I want to make one more correction. The Economic Secretary said that the NAO had not raised specific access problems with the Treasury, which, she said, would be the first port of call. I raised that matter in the NAO-Treasury liaison meeting last week. Her argument misses the point. The issue that is involved is one of principle—that Parliament's auditor should have unfettered access—and does not involve the volume of cases in access disputes. However, the Treasury has not been plugging the NAO as the first port of call.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Specific access problems arise when Departments refuse to provide access to the bodies that they fund or the contractors whom they employ. NAO teams are in constant contact with all Departments and in the first instance will raise their concerns with the relevant Department. Issues are raised with the Treasury only when a stalemate occurs. The Economic Secretary referred to internal Whitehall procedures relating to the way in which Departments will inform the Treasury. Neither the Comptroller and Auditor General nor I are responsible for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens when we deal with the Treasury? Treasury involvement with training and enterprise councils provides a good example of the sort of response that the NAO can expect. The relevant Department readily accepted the need for NAO access, but the Treasury sought to veto that, and lengthy negotiations ensued. They were resolved only when the Treasury conceded the point because the Comptroller and Auditor General threatened to qualify his opinion of that Department's accounts. The picture that is contained in the briefing that was given to the Economic Secretary does not accord with our experience at the coalface; we found that the opposite was the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When this matter is considered by Members in the other place, I am sure that they will agree with me that Ministers' arguments do not pass any test. For that reason, and for the reasons that I have given, I shall press the clause to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not take up much of the Committee's time—we debated these matters, which are worthy of lengthy discussion, during our two previous sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West for his contribution, and for reminding us of some of the many scandals that occurred under the Tory Government. He demonstrated the undoubted value of the PAC, which is much respected by all hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall kick off by agreeing with my right hon. Friend that this matter is not about auditing. Different
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
auditing arrangements are used in different places. The Comptroller and Auditor General and the NAO have audit rights relating to many parts of Government. Other parts of Government are audited by private companies, perhaps because they are in a company, and private-sector auditors are appointed accordingly. I hope that all Committee members agree that we are discussing not auditing but access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend discussed the work of the NAO and the PAC. I do not believe that Departments, the Government or individuals are always saintly. He also discussed Departments and the failures that were discovered by the NAO and the PAC and thoroughly examined by the PAC. That shows not only how problems can and do arise, but that the present system does detect and deal with them. No system can guarantee to discover a problem as soon as it arises; if it could, we would live in a problem-free world. Such a world would probably be rather boring, and would certainly be very different from the one in which we live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Dorset is wrong about certain aspects of new clause 1. Its provisions would follow money originating—I emphasise that word—in the Consolidated Fund, so it would have a wide application. It would apply irrespective of rights that the Inland Revenue may have to check whether family tax credits have been obtained fraudulently. Money passing through the hands of intermediary departments or agencies to the smallest of contractors would be discovered. As my right hon. Friend eloquently noted, that would increase the burden on small businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary reconsider her speech, which symbolised the chain of argument? The Financial Secretary and I argued about whether the extension of the NAO's powers would cover employers as taxpayers or merely as agents of the state. The Economic Secretary seems to think that her speech supported the argument of her hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, but it supported mine. She clearly stated that the provision would have a wide application where the state supplies money from the Consolidated Fund. Does she agree that, in fact, the NAO's powers would be extended only in cases in which a particular private operator acted as the agent of the state in paying out money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did say "questions"; it is written down in front of me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In any event, there is much truth in my right hon. Friend's comments. I should have said that the issues and the questions remain the same, but we cannot simply fast-forward the answers from 1866 to 2000 in one whoosh. We should all recognise that the Bill deals with resource accounting and budgeting, not the delivery of additional access for the NAO and the Comptroller and Auditor General. I am grateful for my right hon. Friend's comments on the love-hate relationship between the Public Accounts Committee and the Treasury—Treasury officials may believe that there is more evidence of the second component of that relationship than of the first. I reiterate the words of my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to the Public Accounts Committee, and urge the Committee not to believe that there is a conspiracy to deflect or obstruct public interest in proper scrutiny. There is no such conspiracy, and it would be unfair to suggest that there is. I hope that, as part of the love relationship between the Public Accounts Committee and the Treasury, that is properly recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can only apologise for the lack of response to the letter. To be fair, it was addressed to officials, not to Ministers, and it arrived during what all members of the Committee accept was an extensive dialogue between the National Audit Office, the Public Accounts Committee, the Treasury and the Government over an extended period about access. That may have led officials misguidedly to believe that, because there had been an extensive dialogue, no answer was required. Nevertheless, I apologise for the fact that it did not receive an answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed many different issues. My right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West commented on the collision of ideas, but I hope that there is no such collision. The collision that we recognise is between what the Government intend the Bill to contain, and how realistic it is to deal in so concentrated a form, with all the questions that might arise on how to translate in such a short period the changed circumstances of government from 1866 to the new millennium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Audit Office has good access and some of the points made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West illustrate that. The fact that the National Audit Office fully investigated the problem of Forward Catering is an example of how the NAO has good access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause refers to access, and the NAO has access to all non-departmental public bodies, although it does not audit all of them. They have different auditors for different reasons, but the NAO has produced reports on non-departmental public bodies that it does not audit, and those reports have been valuable, have contributed to the scrutiny and have ensured that the issues with which hon. Members are rightly preoccupied are being dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be giving the impression that the National Audit Office has access to all non-departmental public bodies, but that is not so. It must often go through detailed and protracted negotiations to obtain that right, and many non-departmental public bodies prevent the NAO from examining their books. Is the Minister satisfied with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that they had gained access. The question is whether it is statutorily underpinned, as I said during our previous sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is not the right vehicle to advance the issue. The discussion is relevant, however, and I recognise that concerns exist. The Government are prepared to consider areas in which access might be improved, although it should not be assumed, as some Committee members have, that the views of the Government and the National Audit Office on individual cases will always be identical. We are prepared to consider what changes can be made by administrative means, but we will not use the Bill as a bus, to be caught quickly if jumped on, to deal with such a broad and complex issue. That is why my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary told the Public Accounts Committee that he was keen to have an on-going dialogue on such issues. Dialogue must have a broad agenda, which should include the cost of audit and the impact of audit on risk-taking and innovation. Although my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West parodied some of those issues somewhat, there are serious matters to be addressed, as hon. Members on both sides of the Committee recognise. Other issues include the link with the "Modernising Government" White Paper, the impact on service providers, the duplication of work carried on by other bodies such as regulators, and the need to talk to other public and private sector bodies involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I thank the Economic Secretary for her apology for the non-reply to the letter, although there were two letters, not one. It is nice to receive the apology, but it does not resolve the fact that the PAC was under a misapprehension for seven months, during which there was no communication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary spoke warm words about the value of the NAO and the PAC. She apparently accepted some of the arguments, while, at the same time, saying that the Bill is not the appropriate vehicle. It is the only vehicle—there have only been two or three appropriate vehicles since 1866. Bearing in mind the fact that the record of these proceedings will be read carefully in another place, will she give an assurance that the Government will consider the statutory option. We need further primary legislation providing statutory rights, not discretionary rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, we are prepared to have a full discussion of all such matters. It would prejudice the outcome of such a discussion if I were to give any assurance. Furthermore, the right hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that Ministers cannot usually give assurances about the Government's future legislative programme. Even if I could, it would not help him greatly. As I said, the agenda extends far beyond the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
issues covered in the Bill, which concerns the introduction of resource accounting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude with one point that I hope will help Committee members. It has been argued that the wording of the clause should reflect that of earlier legislation—that it should be expressed in terms of rights on the part of the Comptroller and Auditor General instead of obligations on the part of the Department. No legal reason exists not to change the wording, as both forms of wording mean the same. If this matter concerns Committee members greatly, I shall, for presentational reasons, consider the matter further, and the Government might decide to adopt the wording that some Committee members would like. There was no intention other than to ensure that the Comptroller and Auditor General had the same access to Departments as previously. If the change in wording is causing problems, I would be happy for it to be removed. In the light of that, I urge members of the Committee to reject new clause 1. It should not form part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall say just a few words concerning matters for which I have responsibility on the Opposition Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are moving towards an era in which PFI will be massively extended, with the agreement of both sides of the House. The risks are analogous to those that arose when the previous Conservative Administration, with the best of intentions, unleashed personal pensions. When matters move to the private sector, they become different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have debated whether the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"allow the Comptroller access at all reasonable times"</p></blockquote>
have the same meaning as the words in the new clause. However, that relates only to Department accounts. The Economic Secretary's assurance in respect of PFI rested on the argument that the matter would be covered by standard contracts. That is questionable. The Government would be wise to have the insurance of the statutory right of access so as to be able to follow public money through PFI projects. Otherwise, there will be a far greater danger of a harvest of rows and scandals—situations such as those to which the right hon. Member for Swansea, West referred. That runs the risk of discrediting PFI, which would be a disaster that neither side of the House wishes to see. Partnerships UK is designed to explode the number of PFI deals. The Bill facilitates that, but does not underpin it with a statutory right of access. That is totally contradictory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before turning to the detail our amendments, I shall explain in general terms how clause 10 will enable us to prepare the whole of Government accounts and why they are so important. Clause 10 places a duty on the Treasury to prepare consolidated accounts for the public sector in order to meet the commitment given in the code for fiscal stability. To enable the Treasury to meet that requirement as efficiently as possible, it allows that Department to designate which public sector bodies will be covered and provides it with powers to request
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
the audited information necessary to prepare the account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Audited whole of Government accounts will improve the information available and support the conduct and monitoring of fiscal policy. The accounts will also improve accountability to Parliament and provide greater transparency for taxpayers. However, producing full audited whole of Government accounts will require greater conformity across the public sector in accounting policy, systems and procedures. That is a major challenge, so the Government have decided to adopt a staged approach, and will concentrate first on delivering audited accounts covering central Government Departments. A final decision to extend coverage to the whole public sector will be taken in due course, when the outcomes of possible developments in financial reporting and further development work are clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that it will be possible to publish audited central Government accounts for 2002–03 onwards, with full audited whole of Government accounts perhaps published from 2005–06 onwards. In the intervening period, there may be significant changes in the composition of the public sector and best practice accounting methods. Those factors, combined with the inherent need to allow for the staged expansion of the scope of accounts, led us to adopt a framework approach to the clause, rather then be over-prescriptive at this early stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind hon. Members' concern about the Treasury, the clause contains three key controls, ensuring that the Treasury does not misuse that flexibility. First, the scope of the accounts must be approved by Parliament. Secondly, as with resource accounts prepared under clause 5, whole of Government accounts must be prepared in accordance with UK-generally accepted accounting practice, subject only to those modifications necessary for a not-for-profit environment and public expenditure control requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the accounts must give a true and fair view, otherwise the Comptroller and Auditor General will qualify his audit report. Whole of Government accounts will be an important extension of resource accounting and will provide Parliament with an overview of public finance, which it has never had before. Clause 10, along with our amendments, will provide the framework to secure that major advance in public accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government Amendment No. 75 will not change the intended scope of WGA. Its sole intention is to allow information to be collected from bodies through processes other than the designation route in clause 10. The change was required because clause 10(1) defines WGA as a set of accounts for a group of designated bodies. Therefore, information can be included only if it is obtained through the designated route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10(4) provides that public sector bodies alone may be designated for inclusion in WGA. The amendment reverses that process by defining the accounts as being for a group of public sector bodies, so that designation becomes only one way of
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
collecting information for WGA, allowing other sources to be used as necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Devolution gave rise to special challenges in framing the WGA clauses. A main driver for WGA is providing better information to support the conduct and monitoring of fiscal policy. Of course, that is a reserved matter for the Westminster Parliament, However, preparing WGA will involve the submission and audit of accounting information, both of which are matters for which powers have been devolved to varying extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the introduction of the Bill, the Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) Bill has been amended to provide the Scottish Executive with parallel powers to collect information from Scottish public sector bodies. The latter Bill may be used in conjunction with the Treasury's general powers under section 96 of the Scotland Act 1998 to request information for fiscal and macro-economic management purposes for inclusion in the WGA. To reinforce the Government's intention to use that approach to collecting WGA information, our new clause on obtaining information includes a restriction preventing the Treasury from designating Scottish bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more limited extent of the powers devolved to the National Assembly for Wales will mean that the WGA proposals should not impinge the arrangements put in place under the Government of Wales Act 1998. For WGA purposes, therefore, we plan to obtain, through the designated route, information on bodies in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will address amendment No.76 and new clause 3 together. The explanatory information provided when the amendments were tabled contains a diagram explaining how we plan that the collection, preparation and audit process for the WGA should work. The explanatory information also describes clearly how subsections (3) to (8) of clause 10 have been incorporated in the new clause. Therefore I propose to draw the Committee's attention to only the main changes to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2)(b) has been added to make it clear that the Treasury can require consolidation information to be prepared in electronic format. Similarly, the words "in such manner" have been added to subsection (2)(d) to allow the Treasury to direct bodies to deliver information electronically.

Subsections (3) and (4) allow the Treasury to require designated bodies to submit accounting information at certain times during the financial year. This would allow unaudited interim financial information to be prepared and published in the same way as is done by commercial companies. We envisage this provision becoming operative only after the WGA preparation process is well established. Although that juncture may seem remote now, we believe that it is prudent to allow for the eventuality, as experience in the commercial world is that when information becomes available there is increased interest and more frequent updates are requested. It also fits with

	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
the increased provision of information to which the Government are committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 77 corrects an erroneous cross-reference in the Bill. In the published version the cross-reference should have been to clause 10(6)(b). The provision previously cross-referenced is transferred into new clause (3), which relates to obtaining information. The same applies to amendment No. 83; the cross-reference should have been to clause 10(6). Amendment No. 84 simply changes the cross-reference at the end of clause 25(3) to allow for the new clause proposed in our amendment No. 15. The provision originally cross-referred to is also transferred into new clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments to clause 10 will provide a robust efficient framework for obtaining information on, and the preparation of, whole of Government accounts. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to amendment No. 37. It is a little more than a probing amendment and, depending on what the Minister says, I may withdraw it. The substantive point, as the Minister said, is that clause 10 allows the Government to stage the preparation of the whole of Government accounts, which we think is sensible and a proper and appropriate route. There might be a temptation along the way to bring accounts in more quickly than they should be, depending on how strong the internal accounts of the sectors brought in are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment is concerned solely with my Committee's role in scrutinising the accounts. Under clause 10(3), the Comptroller and Auditor General is required to issue a report on the whole of Government account that is about to be laid before the House. One issue on which we shall expect the Comptroller and Auditor General to report is the limitations and usefulness of the accounts. Amendment No. 37 would require the Treasury to provide information necessary for a sound basis for the Comptroller and Auditor General to report to my Committee on the limitations and usefulness of the accounts. That relates particularly to the internal accounts of new parts of Government entering the whole of Government accounts. It will require the Treasury to report clearly to Parliament the criteria that it has used in making decisions to include, or exclude, particular bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Hood. I was temporarily asleep—not actually but figuratively. For the record; "Irony".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak briefly to amendment No. 75—not that I have any objection to it as a replacement for subsection (1) because they are equally deficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 75 brings to light the reason why the Government were wrong to reject a national accounts commission or whatever other independent body will settle the shape of the accounts, why that
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
decision will be overturned in another place and why the Government will eventually change their minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth attending to the precise wording of amendment No. 75, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Treasury shall prepare in respect of each financial year a set of accounts"—</p></blockquote>
that is fine—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for a group of bodies each of which appears to the Treasury … to exercise functions of a public nature, or … to be entirely or substantially funded from public money."</p></blockquote>
Anything that moves could probably be regarded in that way, as "substantially" can have any meaning that one likes. The important part is
	<br><blockquote><p>"to exercise functions of a public nature",</p></blockquote>
and we are being told that the Treasury will have discretion—so it can change its view year by year—to include whatever it wishes from the main Government accounts, which we in Parliament will all be able to read and understand for the first time under our splendid and enlightened new system. We shall see a balance sheet of income and expenditure as drawn up by the Government. The rest of the reform does not amount to a row of beans, but this is critical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the first time ever, democracy may consist of some, perhaps many, Members of Parliament genuinely understanding what the Government are spending and receiving. That is splendid—except for the fact that the Treasury will be able to decide every year what to include and what to exclude in the accounts. One year the Treasury might decide that because PPP involves functions of a public nature, it is in; but the next year it may be out. If I were Chancellor of the Exchequer or Chief Secretary at some future date, and someone told me, "Minister, it is a little inconvenient to include this body in the accounts this year. A great deal of expenditure is associated with it, but not much income. There are many liabilities that we do not like. How about dropping them this year?" I would be tempted to accede, and might consult my Treasury lawyers to ascertain whether it was legal. They would say, "Oh, Minister, yes! Are we not wise? An Act allows you to decide purely on the basis of what 'exercising a public function' means to you. We can advise you not to include it this year." Wham—it is out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that the Economic Secretary intends to act that way. She will solemnly assure us in a moment that she does not. If so, she should not seek to pass an amendment that would allow it to happen. Legislation is necessary to create rules to prevent wrong things from happening. The amendment is systematically wrong and is viewed as wrong across the political spectrum. It is wrong for the Government to include some provisions and exclude others ad hoc. The Bill should make that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a reason why the Economic Secretary cannot change the provision, even if she wants to. It is impossible to define in statute—for ever, or at least for many years to come—the scope of Government activity. Nobody knows. We started a splendid new departure in the late 1980s and the present Government are heroically continuing it. It will probably be part of the British political consensus
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
for many decades to come. I refer to the extension of Government services to areas previously unheard of, at the same time as the withdrawal of the state from other activities. Nobody can judge precisely what is within the scope of Government accounts, as the Economic Secretary well knows. That is why we need an independent body, without any interest in presentation, to decide what goes in and what goes out. The only alternative is, as proposed in the amendment, to give the Treasury discretion year by year to decide what is or is not convenient for inclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not labour the point any more. The Government amendment is wholly unacceptable, clearly wrong, and should and will be changed by the inclusion of an independent body. Instead of worrying about whether the amendment is passed, the Economic Secretary should be thinking about what public body would be suitable in our democracy to ensure that Government accounts are meaningful. She should not be deciding what the Treasury will find convenient to include from one year to another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to reply, but not to the point made by the hon. Member for West Dorset. I have explained fully why we need that sensibility; it has nothing to do with his paranoia about the Treasury. The claim that things could drop in and out of accounts without Parliament or the Public Accounts Committee noticing is exaggerated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary says that Parliament would notice if something dropped in or out of the accounts. Does she have any conception of how many items might be involved? Does she genuinely believe that, given a hundred thousand different projects, we in Parliament could wake up one Monday morning and say, "Ah, I've noticed that you've dropped the Leeds symphony hall because it has extra liabilities of £100 million." Given that she has excluded the NAO, does she really think that we in Parliament will inspect accounts with a microscope to discover whether the Leeds symphony hall has been dropped? [

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry; I was laughing about a remark that was made from a sedentary position behind me. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his instruction in how legislation should work, about which he clearly believes that I am painfully ignorant. I disagree fundamentally with him about those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for being slow to respond to the point on amendment No. 37 made by the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden. We fully accept that it is reasonable for Parliament to take a close interest in the scope of WGA and the designation process that underpins it. Designation decisions will be taken on the basis of a set of high-level principles that we plan to set out in the 
	<i>Resource Accounting Manual,</i> which, therefore, will be subject to review by the Financial Reporting Advisory Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the scope of WGA is gradually extended, each new statutory instrument will describe the new categories of body being included in WGA. That should provide a good overview of the designation
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
process for Parliament. As part of his audit, the Comptroller and Auditor General will examine the designation decisions that relate to each body. He could highlight any significant decisions with which he disagreed. That process should provide Parliament with sufficient assurance that the Treasury is not misusing its designation powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In due course, WGA may encompass more than 1,500 bodies, so the report proposed in the amendment would be impossibly burdensome to produce and add little to the process. We hope that the right hon. Gentleman is convinced, as I am, that the existing arrangements and the CAG's involvement at appropriate stages will allow parliamentary scrutiny and that, therefore, he will not press his amendment to a Division. If he were to do so, I should encourage hon. Members to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Economic Secretary for that response. I shall not press my amendment to a Division. She is right that it would be a sizable burden and that such matters will be dealt with in other ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset, if I had considered the villainies that he might get up to as a prospective Chancellor of the Exchequer, I might have paid even more attention. I shall return to those prospective villainies under clause 11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary has made a serious point, which is an improvement. She said that the Treasury would be constrained because Parliament could inspect the general orders that it made. I am sure that she is right; that is exactly how the Treasury will go about its business. I do not think that she has had the benefit of experience of working inside government and making orders on these matters, but I have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For some years at 10 Downing street I was involved in the annual business of setting the orders that established the distribution of local government finance. If the Minister cared to talk to her colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, they would say what I am about to say, although not publicly. I can say it publicly because some time has passed. The year-by-year activity goes like this. Officials go away and labour mightily to produce a distributional order for standard spending assessments that conforms to general principles. It can be annunciated before Parliament and is protected from defeat in law, because it is general, but it nevertheless meets Ministers' policy objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then Ministers and special advisers come along and say, "Unfortunately, we have noticed that council X, which we particularly wish to favour, and council Y, which we particularly wish to disfavour, have not come out right." Officials—some of the brightest officials in Whitehall are doing this—go away and invent a new set of much more complicated general principles. Because they still qualify as general in a legal sense, they still cannot be defeated in the courts. Lo and behold, the two councils suffer the fates that Ministers and special advisers wanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0469">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
However, it turns out that another council has been hit which was not meant to be, so the general principles are revised. By an ineluctable process of generality used as a substitute for specificity, the specific results that Ministers want are partially, but not completely, achieved. Sometimes they are defeated at law. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] If the chuntering of the Government Whip is meant to indicate that this is some special malfeasance of the previous Government, he is wrong. It has been going on for half a century—it went on under the previous Government, it is going on now and it will go on in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Economic Secretary genuinely believes that by setting up general orders she will avoid the possibility of Governments of any persuasion finding it convenient to exclude or include some item and forming a general principle to achieve that effect, she is misled about the nature of government. No such assurance can be given because she employs, on behalf of the public, some 2,000 very brilliant people at the Treasury who, to safeguard the proper interests of their Ministers in presenting matters to the public, will always invent for her general principles that will achieve the bad results that I am talking about. She cannot hide behind general principles; the only assurance is an independent body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 67, in page 5, line 4, leave out subsection (1) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1) The Treasury shall prepare consolidated accounts for the whole of government, subject to subsection (1A) below.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(1A) In pursuance of subsection (1) above, the Treasury shall—

	<ol>

	<li>before 1st June 2000, consult with the Comptroller and Auditor General, Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliament, as to the criteria by which bodies will be deemed to be part of government for the purposes of this section, and publish the results of the consultations;</li>

	<li>before 1st December 2000, designate by order the bodies to be included in the first consolidated accounts for the whole of government;</li>

	<li>before 1st December 2002, complete all the preparations required to produce the first consolidated accounts for the whole of government for the following financial year;</li>

	<li>after the publication of the first set of consolidated accounts for the whole of government, review every three years which bodies should in future be deemed to be part of government in consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor General, Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliament, and following such a review, designate by order the bodies to be included in future consolidated accounts for the whole of government.'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The amendment is an attempt to find a way forward between the Government's proposed designation process for what is to be included in WGA and what most Opposition Members—and I suspect a few Labour Members—would prefer: namely, an independent body, the case for which the hon. Member for West Dorset has just put. I note in passing that the hon. Gentleman's comments shed light on what many of us suspected went on in Whitehall to gerrymander resources allocated to councils. However, it has never been quite so openly
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
stated by an official—I would bet that no one has been as frank as the hon. Gentleman. I am sure that those who work or used to work in local government will have a wry smile at his exposure of what goes on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) and I are putting forward an alternative designation process. It is not perfect, as it is not an independent body. It would require the Treasury to carry out a proper consultation process with all the bodies that need to be consulted, including this place, to publish the results and to set out the criteria by which bodies should be included in the WGA. That would ensure that those bodies that ought to be included in the WGA were included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 67 goes some way to meeting some of the concerns of the hon. Member for West Dorset. It is not perfect. It tries to ensure that the process is kept up to date. A review process is built into it to ensure that, if new bodies or agencies are set up, if things are contracted out, privatised or whatever, the criteria can be looked at again and the Government can, by order, remove bodies from the WGA or put them on to it. That designation process has greater merits than what is proposed in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One other aspect to amendment No. 67 that is substantively different from the Government's proposed way of assembling WGA is that it contains dates and a timetable. The Government may say that requiring Departments and the Treasury to meet certain timetables for assembling these complicated accounts is far too restrictive. What happens if they miss them or if it all turns out to be far more difficult than we first thought? Well, the experience of resource accounting and budgeting is that, if Whitehall is given an open-ended timetable, it will take an awful long time to present the accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Resource accounting and budgeting was put forward by the previous Government in 1994 by the then Chancellor, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). They are only just beginning to be looked at and used as living accounts, as it were. That is a long delay. Whether it was because the mandarins hoped that we politicians would forget about it and shelve the idea or whether it was genuinely complex, I do not know. But, having taken all that time, the lessons have been learned. The skills and expertise have been developed. We do not need to wait another decade before we get the WGA. There is cross-party support for this, as we all seem to believe that this will make a huge difference and be a paradigm shift in the way in which we look at public finances. Let us therefore get to WGA as soon as possible. Let us not wait or put obstacles in the way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This information is important and will improve the way in which the country is governed. It will, as the Economic Secretary said, enable us to make sure that fiscal policy operates far more effectively and is more readily understandable, not just by this place, but by Ministers and civil servants, because all the information will be there in a comprehensive and, we hope, consistent way. If it is so beneficial and if it will help the Minister and the civil servants do their jobs and enable us to make sure that they are doing their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V001P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
job properly, let us have that information pretty quickly. Let us not waste time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the Economic Secretary gives clear reasons why it is completely impossible to keep to the timetable, we shall be anxious and want to know what timetable she envisages. We may never get hold of Government accounts as a result of the Bill: the Government are making no attempt to accomplish the matter by a certain date. The Government may be keen to get whole of Government accounts, but events often get in the way, so that they do not get the priority they deserve. Short-term political pressures may result in Ministers telling their civil servants, "Don't worry about that, as we can put it off for another year or two, or even another five into the next Parliament. You should focus on this matter, which is far more important to our electoral considerations."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, for Parliament, this country and the running of public services, WGA is one of the most important matters with which the Treasury can deal. Therefore, Committee members should tie Ministers and civil servants down to producing those accounts by a prescribed date. If the Economic Secretary is not prepared to back the amendment in the timetable, will she outline the timetable that she and her colleagues have in mind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is not acceptable. The purpose of the WGA clause in the Bill is to provide enabling legislation for the production of WGA, not specify a detailed, unrealistic timetable for preparation and completion. The timetable being followed is outside the scope of the Bill, but it is set out in the 1994 Green Paper. There is no question of delay, as we are on time in relation to all matters. I therefore urge hon. Members to oppose the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady was not forthcoming. She says that the Government are on time. However, there is no timetable for the final publication of WGA. Will she confirm that the process is open-ended?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to press the amendment to a vote. I wanted to air my concerns, and I trust that the Economic Secretary has taken note of them. Will she tell her officials that the process is not allowed to be open-ended? She should tell them that she, her colleagues in the Treasury and other Departments—and Parliament—want that information and that they should make it a priority. Her civil servants should set out when they will deliver that information to Ministers and Parliament. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 70, in page 5, line 24, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(6A) Where a body for the purposes of subsection 6(b) uses an auditor other than the Comptroller and Auditor General, it must report this to the Treasury and to Parliament, and justify the decision, including how this represents good value for money.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment would ensure that resources are not wasted and that the audit is not duplicated. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
concerned the Minister when we examined access rights. Indeed, when the Chief Secretary to the Treasury gave evidence to the PAC, he said that that was why the Comptroller and Auditor General's access rights could not be extended to several bodies and why the Government were worried about the potential costs of duplication, scrutiny, audit and so on—the whole list of excuses that we heard earlier. Amendment No. 70 should be acceptable to Ministers, because it is an attempt to avoid that sort of duplication. Where bodies that have to prepare accounts for WGA are designated but choose to use an auditor other than the Comptroller and Auditor General, they must explain why and make their case in terms of value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want a whole set of auditors. It may be that, in specific cases, a particular body or Department uses a private sector auditor—because that is the cheapest way to prepare the accounts—but then sends them to the National Audit Office for scrutiny so that the NAO has oversight of them. In many cases, however, better use might be made of public money if the body or Department concerned went straight to the NAO for auditing of the accounts. The idea behind amendment No. 70 is to avoid wasteful duplication and to ensure that when Departments and bodies choose not to use the NAO, they justify that decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman has tried to be helpful over the life of this Committee, but I regret to say that I will not be helpful in return, because I urge hon. Members to reject the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It makes perfect sense for auditors to audit the financial information that is required for WGA as well as the financial statements of bodies. There is no reason to alter those arrangements. There is no logic in the hon. Gentleman's suggestion; it would merely lead to a duplication of effort and confusion. It makes sense to retain the arrangements in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the Economic Secretary would give the Committee a good argument for why the amendment was unnecessary. It would not, as she seemed to suggest, prevent bodies from getting audited in any way they chose; it would merely require them to justify any decision not to go to the NAO by showing that it was a cost-effective approach. That is hardly limiting. One would think that a Government who were trying to get best value for money in public audit would jump at the idea saying, "I wish that we'd thought of it first." The amendment would not change the process—it merely seeks a little openness about how public money is used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I do not intend to press the amendment to a vote, but I hope that the Economic Secretary will reflect on the issue and ask her Treasury officials in the precincts of Great George Street to justify why such a provision should not be included in the Bill later. I maintain that it would improve the legislation and her response gave the Committee no reason to demur from that judgment.

	<br><blockquote><p>'The Treasury and a body which is designated for the purpose of section 10 and a person who acts as auditor of such a body'.</p></blockquote>
The Bill places on the CAG a new duty to report on the whole of Government accounts, which the Public Accounts Committee welcomes. It is right and proper that Parliament's own officer reports to the House of Commons on an account whose aim is to consolidate the financial statements of the whole of the UK public sector and, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset pointed out, to provide a certain type of information for the first time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To maximise credibility, the accounts need to be independently audited to professional standards, which already happens in New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States. As the Government White Paper of July 1998 acknowledges,
	<br><blockquote><p>"a WGA should be capable of withstanding audit and … to justify an unqualified opinion they would need to be free of material error as defined by the standards of the auditing profession."</p></blockquote>
Yet the Bill does not provide the CAG with the powers that the standards of the auditing profession require to guarantee such an unqualified opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the private sector, the powers of the principal auditors of a consolidated account are governed by statute. As there has been a dispute about it, I shall read out section 389A(I) of the Companies Act 1985:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A subsidiary undertaking which is a body corporate incorporated in GB, and the auditors of such an undertaking, shall give to the auditors of any parent company of the undertaking such information and explanations as they may reasonably require for the purposes of their duties as auditors of that company."</p></blockquote>
Statute already recognises the need for auditors to have access to information and explanations not just
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
from the auditors of subsidiaries, but the subsidiaries themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Generally accepted accounting practice also recognises that in some circumstances primary auditors need to undertake their own tests within the bodies consolidated. Accounting standard 510 governs the relationship between principal auditors—those reporting on the financial statements of an entity that include financial information on one or more component bodies—and the auditors of the financial information of the component bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The principal auditors may consider it appropriate to discuss with the other auditors, and the directors or management of the component, the audit findings or other matters affecting the financial statements of the component and to request copies of reports to directors or management issued by the other auditors. They may also decide that supplementary tests of the records or the financial statements of the component are necessary. Such tests may, depending on the circumstances, be performed by the principal auditors or the other auditors."</p></blockquote>
Yet the Bill provides the CAG only with access to information and documents from the external auditors of the bodies consolidated within the accounts and not from the bodies themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers provided to the CAG by the Bill are also inconsistent with those that already operate in respect of the only other major consolidated account that has existed for many years in central Government. I refer to the accounts of the trust and authorities of the national health service, which are consolidated into a summarised account for the national health service. Here the Comptroller and Auditor General is the auditor of the consolidated account but not of the individual trusts and authorities within the consolidation.
