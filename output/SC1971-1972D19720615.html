	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 74, in page 3, line 9, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but in no case shall it be less than the earnings-related supplement to sickness benefit which the beneficiary was receiving".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the same time it will be convenient to discuss Amendment No. 9, in Schedule 1, page 11, line 15, after "£6.75", insert:

	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will recall that, on the last Amendment, at least, we had a very good debate. What improved the situation out of all recognition at the last Sitting was that we had contributions from both sides. This is not always so, and I must say in passing that it genuinely helped the discussion. The Under-Secretary smiles. I hope that he will agree that the contributions from his own side were helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Brilliant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The conduct of one hon. Member from the Government side certainly was, because he voted with us. I hope that we can have a debate in that kind of spirit, with contributions from both sides, again this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Amendments is to improve the lot of the invalidity pensioner by the introduction of the principle of earnings-related benefits into the State scheme to cover the needs of long-term incapacity. These proposals are in line with Labour Party thinking on the subject. During the last Parliament, the Labour Government introduced the National Superannuation and Social Insurance
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
Bill, which was wholly based on the principle that, if men and women made earnings-related contributions, they should be entitled in return to earnings-related benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Present Ministers have carried with them into office the beliefs they held in Opposition, and those beliefs are now unfortunately in the White Paper, Strategy for Pensions. The Government are still floundering along with the idea that, in future, the work force will be prepared to pay earnings-related contributions and receive in return only flat-rate benefits. If the average man and woman were asked to accept such conditions in the private sector, one would be entitled to describe such a scheme approaching a swindle, and one could hardly envisage that there would be many customers for it if it were advertised in the daily or the week-end Press. However, I do not wish to exacerbate any feelings of tension or disagreement between the two sides of the Committee. I seek only to achieve agreement in this limited area in order further to assist the long-term sick and invalidity pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present system of State benefits provides that a person with an adequate contribution record who becomes sick and is unable to work is entitled to an earnings-related sickness benefit in return for his contributions for the first six months of incapacity. After that, however, he returns to flat-rate benefit, which we now call the invalidity pension. The only items in the Bill which are new are the term "invalidity pension" or sickness benefit and the addition of the invalidity allowance which we discussed on the earlier Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even with the increases proposed in the Bill, with the level of benefit standing at £6.75 for a single person, with higher benefits for a married couple and the trinity of invalidity allowances in addition, 220,000 people will receive only 35p. invalidity allowance and 75,000 will have no invalidity allowance whatsoever. Therefore, very large numbers, perhaps almost all on invalidity pension, will receive a benefit recognising their chronic sickness, their long-term inability to work, but at the end of the day, even the increased rates proposed by the Government are still recognised by the State as being inadequate to live on without recourse to some other form of income. The result is that a large proportion of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0610">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
such sick people will have to depend in the future, as in the past, upon means-tested supplementary benefit in order to have enough to live on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this side of the Committee, we believe that as a matter of priority we should seek to push back the area of means testing as much as we can. I know that the Minister will explain that, as the result of the higher allowances for the children of invalidity pensioners, some pensions could be taken off means-tested benefit and could have enough to live on without means-tested benefit. Nevertheless, large numbers of people who have only the income laid down by the scale rates for invalidity pension will still have to go to the Supplementary Benefits Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of supplementary benefits, there are some contradictions in the argument on either side. It depends upon the attitude taken towards means-tested benefits. The general view of my party is that we should seek to get as many people as possible off means-tested benefits. But the invalidity pensioner or retirement pensioner could well complain under any system, as will happen under this system, that as a result of the pattern of child allowances and the invalidity allowances, when there is an increase in the invalidity pension the net result is that their supplementary benefit has been reduced and in total they are little or no better off. I am not taking about not a change in the rates but about a change in the scheme. As a primary principle, one of the reasons we seek to introduce the concept of earnings-related benefits in return for what are becoming increasingly earnings-related contributions—and with the introduction of the Government's proposals, and if the computers in Newcastle are fully operational by that time, we will move over fully to earnings-related contributions—people will be getting inadequate flat-rate benefits, and for many of them they will not be enough to live on without recourse to means testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That illustrates the two major reasons why we seek to introduce the principle of earnings-related benefits for invalidity pensioners. First, we do not want them on supplementary benefit, and, second, we think that there is an important principle here which should apply not only to the private sector but to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
State scheme, that; there should be a relationship between contributions and benefits. When he begins his working career, no one assumes automatically that his health will break down permanently. People look forward to a build-up of credits in the State scheme, and, when they can, in a private scheme through private insurance, in order to accumulate income for their retirement. What is so sad about the State scheme as it now stands is that there is no real provision for earnings-related benefits or any extra benefits on top of the flat-rate allowances and pension if a person's health breaks down irretrievably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Committee to what we know in the House as the Boyd-Carpenter graduated pension scheme. Under the scheme, for every £7.10s. a man pays in he draws an undynamised 6d. A woman draws the same amount for every £9 she pays in. But if a man or woman has been paying into the scheme from the outset and today becomes a permanent invalidity pensioner, he or she will draw no benefit from the Boyd-Carpenter scheme until reaching the age of retirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Sydney Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sixpence my hon. Friend refers to is in the old currency, is it not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for indicating that the scheme is even worse than it appears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Behind the times as usual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad the hon. Gentleman is starting to interrupt. I gave him every opportunity to make a contribution last Thursday, but all he did was to leave the Committee. I can see he has a speech ready and we look forward to hearing it as soon as I sit down if he can catch your eye, Sir Stephen. The Committee is looking forward to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. A. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not try him by sitting down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. McCrindle) obviously has not been listening. I have something important to say. I recognise that hon. Members on the Government side, even those who were not here at the time, are extremely sensitive about the Tory Mark I swindle, the Boyd-Carpenter scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite apart from the old arguments
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0611">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
we have had, it is intolerable that the scheme pays out undynamised old sixpences, whatever that equals in decimal currency. If a person was entitled to 6d. in 1965 and he begins to draw it in 1975, he does not draw 6p, and the sum he draws takes no account of the effects of inflation. Even worse, if a man's health breaks down irretrievably at age 35, 45 or 55, he gets none of these sixpences until he reaches 65, if he is lucky enough to reach that age. The point has been made by the Disablement Income Group that in this situation a widow is better off than the wife of a man who becomes chronically disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the Minister cannot accept our modest proposals for the introduction of earnings-related benefits for invalidity pensioners, he ought to look at his scheme again if the Government are to show any conscience for what they do with other folks' money once it has been collected. The situation is made worse by the fact that the Government have consistently refused to compel the private sector to provide early retirement pensions. We are not yet in sight of anything which will be acceptable to hon. Members, and, certainly, the scheme proposed in Strategy for Pensions is unacceptable at a time when we are considering the relationship between the public and private sectors, the degree of control and supervision, and the minimum requirements the Government should seek from the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In talking of the private sector, I mean pensions provided by organisations such as the National Coal Board or ICI. The Government are refusing to give the private sector instructions to include provision for early retirement in pension schemes. It is true that many occupational pensions do this. There are some very good occupational pension schemes in this country, and the best are as good as anything else in the world. I do not take a hostile attitude towards occupational pension schemes. The hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. McCrindle), who has a connection with these matters, will recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members are anxious to improve and develop pension schemes from wherever they may spring. Our main job is to see that people have enough to live on. Many firms do not have good schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
Some have inadequate breakdown schemes. Many working men and women do not have any scheme at all in which a breakdown provision can be included. I understand that in Sweden invalidity pensions are a feature of all privately funded schemes and that this is a Government requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Government have not been prepared to say that firms should make provision for breakdown pensions, will the hon. Gentleman tell us what conversations they are having with the life offices and the organisations dealing with occupational pensions on this subject? The pension fund managers must have views about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our object is further to improve the lot of the chronically sick man or woman by continuing the principle of earnings-related benefits after a period of six months. What a terrible blow it must be to have earnings-related benefit during those six months and then overnight be deprived of that extra money and be back to flat-rate benefit. For a man over 60, there will be no invalidity allowance, not even 35p. For a man under 60, there are various rates payable. By the introduction of the earnings-related benefit concept, we should go further along the road in assisting invalidity pensioners, who would find some relationship between their income at work and their income when their health has irretrievably broken down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a highly desirable aim. I hope that the Government will be prepared to accept the Amendments and thus bring additional aid and succour to many thousands of invalidity pensioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sydney Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that we should have had a contribution from the Government side at this juncture. Perhaps hon. Members opposite are waiting for inspiration from me. I hope that we hear from them, because what the Committee has to consider is the principle of what we are proposing, and not necessarily only the cost, which I am sure is uppermost in their minds. Any extension of costs necessarily raises the question of increased costs in industry or additional costs for the Exchequer, which must mean that the "jolly, jolly sixpence" which the Chancellor took off in his first Budget will have to be put back again—if he does not go in for the TUC idea of a wealth tax and really dip into
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
the deep pockets which are able to carry such schemes through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to consider the principle and look at other countries to determine whether we are lagging behind. Judging from the vote on the Common Market issue last night, we can see that there are many feelings of doubt on both sides as to the wisdom of joining the Common Market. I imagine that there are mixed feelings in the Committee. We know the views of my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle). It is not necessary that Britain, if it is destined to join the EEC, should follow a policy of slavish adherence to the emerging systems in the Community. We must discover whether those schemes are progressive in content and point the way to improvement. There should be no slavish adherence in the cause of harmonisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will tell us what the developments are. It is said that we are lagging behind with the idea of earnings-related benefits. One of the principal arguments when my right hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, East (Mr. Crossman) became the Minister in charge of these matters centred round his proposals for national superannuation. I well remember his putting this scheme to the Labour Party Conference many years ago now and the applause and support which it received. I believe that he got the biggest ovation at that conference, and it was not one of those phoney standing ovations; it was a heartfelt compliment, an acceptance that what he said was common sense. He stressed the feeling about the drop in pension which is related to these Amendments. There is a matter of psychology involved for those who fall by the wayside, who become old or who become invalids early in life and have to face a drop in income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spent most of my Second Reading speech talking about pensions, but it may be that in future the problem will not be so great. If workers, under either Government, build up a State pension and invalidity allowance as of right under extended State provision or by extending occupational provision, the future will be brighter. However, we owe something to those at present suffering and who have not built up credits because the schemes were not in operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Billericay told us the other day, the business is
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
extending because the Government's policy has been to encourage such developments. The trade unions have not been slow here. Before I came to the House I was a tutor-organiser of a trades union education organisation, and I involved myself very much in the examination of pension and sickness schemes, because stewards would bring their problems to organisations such as ours. I subsequently worked for the TUC. I bring that sort of background experience to the matter, and I underline what my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. O'Malley) said about the drop in pension. In October, it will be down to £6.75 in simple terms, without additions for dependent relatives, and then without earnings-related benefit after six months. That might represent a considerable drop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be told what the Government have in mind and whether the United Kingdom will make independent progress or will fit in with the harmonisation arrangements in the Common Market. The Disablement Income Group has pointed to the progress which would be made if we were to move in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must get away from the means-test system, which people detest. It goes against the grain to go cap in hand, especially for people who have spent many long years in industry and who in the past worked much longer hours than are customary today. We must examine the whole question of how to relieve such people and at the same time get away from the idea of a means test. There will always be the person who leads an odd sort of life who will have to be assisted on a means-test basis, but it should not be the common pattern of events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the national superannuation scheme was first introduced, it became known as the graduated pension swindle. It was a swindle when one compared the amount of benefits one got with the contributions paid. It still has similar symptoms. I confess that during the period of Labour Government no substantial change was made in that regard, but I have no responsibility in that matter since I was a critic of the Labour Government on that score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I feel that if the electorate had been intelligent enough to return a Labour Government in 1970, we should have taken advantage of the then greatly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0613">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
improved economic situation—a situation which is now worsening—to improve the national insurance system. The balance of payments situation provided a launching pad for the incoming Tory Government for improvements to the system, but in their two years of office they have made a complete mess of it. However, there is no reason why they should not now change their ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with this Amendment, it will not be good enough for the Under-Secretary of State merely to add the global sum involved in Opposition Amendments. Since the object of our Amendment is to improve the position, the hon. Gentleman must deal with principles and inform the Committee whether he is in favour of the improvements which we are suggesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Mr. Paul Dean)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the whole Committee would agree with the object emphasised by the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. O'Malley) in moving the Amendment, namely, an improvement in the invalidity pension. There are provisions in the Bill which do just that, and I shall come to them shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should outline the effect of the two Amendments. The effect of Amendment No. 74 would be to substitute in certain, though not all, cases for the proposed rates of invalidity allowance in the Schedule earnings-related amounts of up to £7 per week. The effect of Amendment No. 9, which is somewhat similar in principle though different in detail, would be to substitute entitlement to earnings-related supplement only for entitlement to invalidity pension where the weekly amount of the supplement payable before the 169th day of incapacity was more than £6.75. It introduces the concept of earnings-relation into the provision of invalidity pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main difficulty in principle about the Amendments is that they do most for the higher earners and nothing for the lower earners. This is the effect of trying to graft on the earnings-related supplement to the present arrangements. I do not believe that the Opposition want to do that. If there is additional money available for invalidity pensioners, it should be concentrated on those with least resources rather than on those with most.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
This is the main effect of the Opposition's Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman sets as his target the aim of trying to get invalidity pensioners off supplementary benefit. This is a target which we all share, but the Amendments would not achieve this. Neither of the Amendments will take one person off supplementary benefit since they would concentrate the money available on the higher rather than on the lower earners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman be a little more specific when he speaks about concentrating the money available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will develop the detailed point in a moment. I am seeking to establish in the first place the principle that the Amendments would not assist the lower earners; this is what is involved in trying to graft this type of arrangement on to the present system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may be allowed to deal a little more with the general background of the principles involved. The earnings-related supplement was introduced by the Labour Administration in 1966. It meant that most people who were sick or unemployed for over 12 days were entitled to an earnings-related supplement on top of a flat rate of benefit for a period of six months, provided that their earnings were sufficient to entitle them to the supplement. This did not apply to people with comparatively modest earnings. At the end of six months, people on the supplement dropped back to the flat-rate benefit to which they were entitled, plus the invalidity allowance and any other allowance which we have been able to introduce in the last two years. The idea of the Opposition when they introduced that scheme was to provide a cushion—to try to ensure that there was not a big drop in income for people who went sick or became unemployed. Inevitably, this meant that the higher paid benefited much more than the lower paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have continued the earnings-related supplement in our proposal in the Bill and in last year's legislation but, in addition, we have concentrated the additional resources available on the long-term sick, those sick for over six months. This is the idea behind the invalidity pension and the invalidity allowances discussed at our last Sitting, and is equally the idea behind the allowances
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0614">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
which give help to the children of invalidity pensioners and to working wives. The concept was not on the basis of earnings but on the basis of likely need, which we felt could best be defined at this stage at the age of onset of disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a few words about long-term aspects. The advantage of concentrating the additional help through the national insurance scheme is that it achieves immediate maturity. This is the contrast between the national insurance scheme, which is based on a pay-as-you-go principle, and almost any form of occupational scheme, whether run by the State or by a firm or company in the market. However much accelerated maturity may be put into an occupational scheme, there is a period of maturity, and people who need benefits have to wait some time before the benefits mature. This appears to us to be a strong argument for concentrating the benefits at this point of time, when we have a backlog to make up, in the national insurance scheme where maturity is immediate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not mean that we are neglecting the longer-term prospects through occupational pension schemes and the like. I answer the point on this aspect put by the hon. Member for Rotherham by saying that we have had discussions with the occupational pension interests and with others concerned and are anxious to remove any barriers which may exist to breakdown pensions. There may be some barriers on the tax side, but we shall ensure that any difficulties which may lie in the way of firms which wish to provide breakdown pensions are removed. Equally, we should encourage everybody who runs a pension scheme, and who is able to to do so, to introduce some element of this kind within the scheme. Equally important, we shall ensure that the Government as employers will set a good example in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there any reason why the Government should not add, as a condition to the exclusion of employees from the proposed reserve scheme by the introduction of other schemes at their place of work, that those other schemes should include provision for breakdown pensions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must be careful not to
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
discuss a Bill which has not yet even been published, but we are anxious to encourage development of breakdown pensions. Many schemes provide for them already. The public service schemes do. I am sure that this movement will grow, given the right conditions and the sure foundations which we intend to build in our long-term proposals for the reform of pension arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell) that we are studying the position in Europe. Whatever differences of view there may be about our future arrangements with Europe, we all agree, I think, that if any of the European countries have practices which are better than ours, it is up to us to find out about them and see what lessons we can learn from their experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Harmonise upwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman says, we want to harmonise upwards. It is difficult to get an accurate comparison, because the figures collected by the various countries do not compare like with like. This is being worked on at the moment so that we can establish a more accurate yardstick. But the broad picture which emerges is that many of the European countries are further advanced in dealing with civilian disability than we are. We have been late in this field. We have been good with war pensions and, on the whole, with industrial injury benefits, but backward in dealing with civilian disability. All of us are now trying to put this right. There are no differences between us on the desire to proceed faster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it not also be true to say that the aid to widows and wives in European countries is nothing like as good as it is here? It rather distorts the picture to take the individual who is disabled as the only example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. That was to be my next point. I had been dealing with disability, but, on the general picture of pensions and pension cover, two points emerge. First, many of the European countries have managed to achieve a higher level of benefit for the individual contributor than we have. But they do not attain anything like so comprehensive
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
a cover for the dependants of the pensioner as we do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, we must not only take into account what is being received in cash but must measure that against the cost of living, housing costs and the fact that there is no free health service in our sense. If one balances out all these factors, there is not a great deal of difference. There are some areas where we are more advanced and some where they are. But I hope that we shall have a more accurate yardstick when we get figures which compare like with like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged for that information and that insight into the Government's thinking. Will the Minister go a short distance back to the maturity theory, which seems to be leading him to reject our Amendments? Although that theory may be right for future State or occupational extensions, it cannot apply to the bulk of people. If they changed their occupations over the years, they would not have built up any maturity, because those occupations would not have enshrined, as do the State principles, full transferability and gearing. I accept that the hon. Gentleman has accepted the whole idea of transferability, but right now there is a case for change. Does the Minister accept that, although the maturity argument might apply in future, it is a bit thin now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is helping me. One of my points is that, although there may be some element of maturity, whether full or accelerated maturity, in the occupational scheme concept, if one puts new benefits into the national insurance scheme or improves the existing benefits, maturity is immediate. As soon as the contributor and the taxpayer have found the money, the legislation has gone through, and the administrative work is done, a benefit can come into effect. I am saying that, with the need at present, this is a better approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objection in principle to the Amendments is that, in our present position, those who are better off will be helped the most.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Marsden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister would want to correct his reference to a "free" health service. We do not have a wholly free service, do we?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point was that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
overwhelming cost of the health service is met from general taxation and not from contributions, whereas in Europe a patient pays, when he sees his doctor or goes into hopsital, a proportion or in many cases the whole of the sum, and has some of it refunded from his insurance scheme. That is the distinction I was drawing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that the Amendments would mean that help would go to those who arc better off rather than those who are worse off. The main effect of Amendment No. 9, for example, is that only those with earnings of £1,470 or more for the relevant year would benefit—that is, those who are eligible, because of their earnings, for the earnings-related supplement. All the rest would be out. I do not think that that is what the Opposition want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Amendments would also exclude a series of other groups, creating anomalies and unfairnesses which I am sure the Opposition do not want. They would exclude the self-employed, those who have been sick since 1966, when the earnings-related supplement was introduced, or before—in other words, the very long-term sick. There would be nothing for those who had exhausted their right to earnings-related supplement before the introduction of invalidity benefit or for those who had received their full entitlement to earnings-related supplement with unemployment benefit but who, later in the same period of interruption of employment, became chronically sick. These are all groups who, both sides would agree, are in much greater need than those who would be covered by the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason that these groups would be excluded is not any defect in drafting of the Amendment but is inherent in the system of earnings-related supplement which we inherited from the party opposite. It is not, therefore, the right approach to try to graft this type of arrangement on to the existing system, because it will not produce the results which I suspect the Opposition would like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Barbara Castle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In these exclusions, is not the Minister recounting faults in the invalidity pension scheme and not just in the earnings-related scheme? Are not some of these exclusions
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
and faults endemic in his own flat-rate scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main exclusions are caused by the form of the earnings-related supplement. Some are caused by the interaction between the earnings-related supplement and the flat-rate benefits, but the main problems are caused by the supplement scheme, which by its very nature—I do not complain about this; it was done deliberately by the Labour Party when in Government—helps only people above a certain level of earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am saying is that one cannot graft these proposals on to the earnings-related supplement scheme without leaving out a whole series of people who, if there were additional resources available, would be the strongest candidates for them. This is much more an argument in principle than about cost, but I must mention that the cost of the Amendments would rise to about £100 million a year gross, or £60 million net.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main argument against the Amendments is that they are objectionable in principle. I hope that hon. Members, having heard how the arrangements would work in practice, will feel able to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first word I had on my scribble was "cost". The Minister has made great play of the fact that he has costed all our Amendments, and I am sure that he will put forward this argument in his beguiling way at each sitting of the Committee. I think he agrees with the objective of improving the lot of the invalidity pensioners and others, but he seemed to lay too much stress on the difficulty which is enshrined in all methods of related social security benefits to previous earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister that the TUC knew that when the scheme was introduced. It accepted that, in the nature of things, the workers who were earning most would benefit most by earnings-related benefits. Nevertheless, it accepted the principle as sound, that it was a recognition of the problem that faces anyone who loses his job for whatever reason, old age, invalidity and so on, and faces an enormous reduction in his income. It was to deal with that problem
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
that the earnings-related principle was introduced by the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is that deficiency. We all received letters as soon as the principle was introduced. The low income earner said, "What kind of Government is this that gives higher benefits to the higher wage earner, the people who could have saved more, who have more resources?" That was the argument adduced by the Government in favour of the three-tier system of invalidity allowances, that the older one was when one became an invalid, the more likely one would be to have resources to fall back on, and, therefore, the allowance should be less than for younger people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I direct the attention of the Committee to the basic principle—I shall not become involved in the nuts and bolts of the Bill—on which we on this side are fighting, namely, the allocation of national resources, how we share out the national cake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer again to what has been happening in the last two years. The Government know perfectly well that in the last two Budgets enormous tax concessions have been given. When we on this side have pointed out that the people who have most resources received most, the Government said that was in the nature of the system that the bigger one's income the greater the tax concession one received under their proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is now using that argument against giving something not to the people earning over £4,000 and £5,000 a year, which was the basic principle that inspired both Budgets, but to people who will get £1.15p, £1.30p or even 60p or 70p invalidity allowance. We are talking about two different kinds of people. The same principle applies. The wealthier sections of the community received the biggest concessions in the Budgets, but that did not inhibit the Chancellor from doing just that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Old-ham, West (Mr. Meacher) went into this matter in great detail, showing the great discrepancies in the tax advantages that have been given in successive Budgets to the wealthier sections of the community as against the poorer sections. Whenever one is dealing with earnings-related benefits in national insurance or in the tax system, one can channel resources to the people to whom one wants to channel them. The Government make their political decisions on these matters. If the Government wanted to channel more resources to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
people about whom we are here concerned, they could do so by a general uplifting of the allowances. That is outside the terms of the Amendments and, therefore, I cannot go into it now. However, when the Minister again refers to the cost being £60 million net, I do not regard that sum as anything but a bagatelle. We shall produce figures later to put that figure and the other costings which the Minister has produced in a proper national context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that under Amendment No. 9 nobody earning less than £1,470 would benefit. Would he give us a little more information on how that figure was arrived at and the numbers that would be involved? Clearly, his officials have done a lot of work on the matter. Will he give us a better break-down of that figure, the numbers involved, and how he arrives at the £60 million net? I do not want to delay the Committee; I have made the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will not lean too heavily on the argument that our Amendments would not help the people most in need. The Government's Budgets in the last two years have done exactly the opposite; they have given most help to those who least needed it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard that argument about three times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the hon. Gentleman will hear it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When taxation was £3,000 million more, the Labour Government did not give more help to the people we are trying to help. I cannot understand why the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) continues to make this allegation. I was not in the House at the time, but I never heard him in public and never read in the newspapers that he was making the allegation there should have been so much more given to these people when taxation was £3,000 million more. Perhaps he will enlighten me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, there were many of us who attacked and criticised our own Government. I hope that the hon. Gentleman the Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) will concede that the last Government had different economic problems in those years from the present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These arguments are interesting, but I am sure that hon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
Members realise that they verge on being out of order. I hope that they will not be tempted to go along that path.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief and keep closely to the Amendments. The argument put by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) is the crucial argument underlying all the Amendments. We are talking about the overall distribution of resources. Although he gave us some strong reasons why we should think further about the Amendments, the Minister did not answer the two main points put by my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. O'Malley). If the Amendments are not accepted, how does the Minister justify that a sick man will receive earnings-related sickness benefit for six months and then there will be a marked fall in the level of his resources, and, at the end of two years, should he still remain sick, there will be a long-term addition. That is ridiculously anomalous in terms of the need of that man and his family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may not be the perfect Amendment to remedy the situation, but we are justified in asking the Government to suggest an alternative better means of protecting that sort of person, because at the moment he does not have such protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other main argument put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham, which has not been answered, is that the man who pays earnings-related contributions will have only a flat-rate sickness benefit as matters now stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the main division in this Committee on all matters is on redistribution, it is perfectly compatible with redistribution to have a relationship between earnings-related contributions and earnings-related benefits. The National Superannuation Bill, which just failed to reach the Statute Book, had that kind of gearing so that earnings-related contributions provided a higher absolute level of benefit for the higher paid, but in relative terms gave rather more to the lower paid. There is no reason why that kind of relationship should not be transferred to other parts of the social security system. The Minister has not answered that point, and we are entitled to ask for an answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister resorted again to what the Government, throughout our proceedings, will repeatedly say, that there is provision
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
in the private sector, and they are encouraging that sector to assist, to fill in the gaps, to upgrade the State system. He said that the Government will put no impediment in the way of private employers providing breakdown pension schemes which will take care of employees at the end of the six months' period and thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows perfectly well that the coverage of these schemes is nowhere near complete. Coverage is only about three-quarters, and it is the lower paid who are not covered. It is these persons whom it is not worth the while of the employer to protect. There are fewer of them covered, and those who are covered have small benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a threadbare excuse to say that one should not look just at the public sector, at what the Government provides, and that there is also a private sector. The private sector, if one happens to be in the higher income range, is excellent, it offers no more than a fairly mean average at the middle levels, and it is decidedly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tatty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: —tatty, as my hon. Friend says, or thoroughly inadequate, if one is in the lower income range.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister wishes to give real encouragement to the private employers, the best method is to show the way by an improved State scheme. Presumably, employers would then have to do at least as well. That is the right way to get improvements in the occupational sector. Exhortation will not do it. That will not work, for good economic, rational business reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister expressed the hope that, if this country enters the EEC, there will be an upgrading. That is a general argument which applies across the board in our social security system. But it is fair to say that, although there will be harmonisation over taxes, economic trading arrangements and matters of that kind, there is little evidence so far—possibly, this is regrettable but it is the fact—of any harmonisation of social policies, because they have much less impact on a customs union and the idea of a wider market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is illusory to suppose that, if we retain rather poorer level benefits, at least in some respects—I take the point about dependants—the quality of the service we offer may well be better. It is illusory to suppose that we shall float upwards when
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
we enter the Common Market. There is no evidence at the moment to indicate that is likely to be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West, I think that the Minister slid over the main point which he made in supposed objection to the Amendment. We are entitled to a more factual explanation about the unfortunate relationship which he asserts, about the form and nature of the earnings-related system, and the consequences for the Amendment. It does not seem to be automatically clear why it is so difficult to graft the one to the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the break-even point is £1,470, but I stress strongly that the Opposition in their first Amendment were suggesting that all invalidity allowances be upgraded to the level of £1.15 on top of the invalidity pension. If it had been accepted, it would have gone a long way to meet the argument that the present Amendment is regressive because it would assist the higher paid more than the lower paid. If the other Amendment had been accepted, the lower paid also would get considerable assistance from a modest but considerably higher flat-rate invalidity allowance on top of the invalidity pension. The Minister is wrong in saying that the Amendment should be rejected because it is regressive and against the general interests of the Opposition. If the other Amendment had been accepted, it would not necessarily be like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will answer those points, particularly about the relationship between the earnings-related system and the Amendment. For several of us, it is not clear that he is justified in a sweeping rejection of the Amendments on the basis of blinding us with science for a couple of minutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Lady wish to intervene now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I would rather hear what the Under-Secretary has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could respond to the additional points that have been made. The hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) says that he is not interested in the nuts and bolts, just the principle. That is fair enough. But I have learned in this job that I have to care desperately about the nuts and bolts, because one of the great problems in national insurance is that a course of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0619">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
action which may appear to be absolutely right in theory may have exactly the opposite effect to that desired when it comes down to the nuts and bolts. The Amendments provide a classic example. They set out principles which everyone accepts, but they become fouled up and produce unfairnesses and anomalies when put into practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not be tempted into dealing with matters of tax relief, in view of what you have said, Sir Stephen. I accept that we shall be coming on to that shortly in another Amendment. The hon. Member for Fife, West asked how we arrived at the figure of £1,470. The figure is provided under the earnings-related system as it exists at present. The earnings-related supplement begins on earnings in excess of £9 a week and £1,470 a year earnings corresponds to £7 a week benefit, which is the maximum available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) asked for more information about how the Amendment would lead to the unfortunate effects I have described. Basically, they are inherent in the system, because if we graft on to an earnings-related supplement, which is what the Opposition are seeking to do in the Amendment, we shall inevitably exclude those who are not entitled to the earnings-related supplement. Amendment No. 9 excludes them completely. Amendment No. 74 does not exclude them completely, but it does exclude a substantial number of people, as I have already explained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendments would give the most help where it was least needed, and I hope, therefore, that the Opposition will feel that they do not wish to press them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful and illuminating debate. It has illustrated the advantage of the detailed examination which we can conduct in a Standing Committee. Inevitably, on the Floor of the House, in Second Reading debates everyone tends to paint the picture with a broad brush. In Committee, however, it is our duty to try to understand the Bill and to understand what is motivating the Government in their policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such a situation, the Opposition very often, quite rightly, put down Amendments blind. During long experience in the House, I have frequently put down Amendments, or risen to speak to them, without completely understanding them. But, by the end of the debate, I have found
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
that I have forced the Minister to realise that he did not fully understand his own policy. Something of the kind has happened this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have started an argument which will have to go on well outside the confines of the Committee and into the future development of policy. The debate has been a most important stage in the illumination of the argument. When we put our Amendments down, we did not imagine that they were perfect. To begin with, the Opposition have to graft something on to an existing stock. It is impossible to graft a perfect rose if the initial briar is inadequate and weak. There are difficulties from that point of view, therefore. There are difficulties also in that we do not have the help of draftsmen or the whole apparatus of expert help which is available to the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were quite clear in our own minds, however, that we were seeking to save the chronic sick and disabled from a totally anomalous and unjustified fall in their standard of life as a result of moving from the six months' earnings-related benefit to the flat rate. In saying that this should be done, we are speaking for the representatives of the disabled in this country. The Disablement Income Group has expressed strong opinions about the failure of this country so far to include in its provision for the long-term incapacitated any form of earnings-related benefit. It is even more concerned that we are continuing to progress under the present Government towards a system which will perpetuate that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is entirely right that we should have used this opportunity to warn the Committee and the country just where the Under-Secretary's principles are leading us. He made great play of the principles, and I want to examine them a little more closely. We have heard a mystifying confusion of principles in the Committee this morning. The Under-Secretary admitted that the two Amendments embodied the same principle, although they used different methods. That principle is to include the chronic sick in an earnings-related scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested when he said that there was no conflict of principle between us. But is there not? He said we were doing it in the wrong way, and in a form which would have unfortunate results. He even used dramatic language and spoke about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0620">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
our good intentions getting fouled up and producing unfairnesses and anomalies. I cannot imagine greater unfairnesses and anomalies than those we are moving towards, with the help of the Bill, in the provision for the chronic sick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am genuinely mystified as to what the Under-Secretary is trying to tell the Committee. First, he said there was no disagreement about principles and then he said, as though it would come as a great surprise and make us immediately drop our Amendments, that the main effect of them, which condemned them out of court, was that they did most for the higher-paid. But any earnings-related scheme will do more for the higher paid. Is that a conflict of principle between us, or is it a basis for agreement? Earnings-related schemes, could be described as the work of the devil, and one could decide to have nothing to do with them, but one cannot accept the earnings-related principle, as I think the Under-Secretary has done, and then say that the Amendment is unacceptable because it would do more for the higher paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where is the consistency in the Minister's thinking? Above all, where is the Government's consistency when they say the real salvation for the provision for old age and so on should lie through private occupational pension schemes? These schemes, by definition, do more for the higher paid. Is the Under-Secretary telling us that he has had a complete change of view and that he now believes that the whole principle of earnings-related benefits is wrong? Do the Government wish to abandon the earnings-related principle in any form? That would mean abandoning their policy on private occupational pension schemes, which at present form such a major part of their overall policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that our aim was to assist only the better off. What greater nonsense could there be? We do not accept his assumption that, in examining all the Amendments, we must be restricted by the Government's idea of what resources are available. He speaks as though we are all in the straitjacket of what we are prepared to put into an insurance scheme. We are in no such straitjacket. Even the Money Resolution does not put us in such a straitjacket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are not caught in the Government's concepts of values or what benefits are available. We are thinking in
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
the context of a Budget when very large resources were available. So it is to falsify or—if I may borrow a phrase—to foul up the Under-Secretary's argument to say that somehow we are not in a position to help anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have plenty of Amendments on the Paper designed to help those who would be dependent upon the invalidity pension and the invalidity allowance, even if the Amendments were passed. We have dealt with Amendments relating to the amount to be paid. The Amendment makes very clear that we are not saying that one group shall receive the benefit to the exclusion of all others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase is,
	<br><blockquote><p>"in no case shall it be less than the earnings-related supplement".</p></blockquote>
We do not say that it should not be higher; we just say that it should not be less than the earnings-related supplement which the beneficiary was receiving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In arguing about the methods the Government have used, the hon. Gentleman said that their methods, presumably by means of a flat-rate invalidity pension and the invalidity allowance, had the advantage of immediate maturity compared with, as he suggested, our own scheme, which would have included earnings-related invalidity benefits. The Government believe in immediate maturity, but our Amendments would mature immediately. There is no difficulty about that.

What we are seeking to do is combine the advantage of the immediate maturity of an invalidity pension or allowance with an advance instalment in a move towards a comprehensive, radical State earnings-related scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has given me the perfect lead-in to something that I want to read to him. If that is right, the people who would be behind this scheme would be the disabled themselves. That is our beacon light. It is on the basis of that philosophy that the hon. Gentleman has turned us down. Let me, therefore, read to him what the Disablement Income Group is arguing. In its Occasional Papers Series No. 12, entitled "Creating a National Disability Income", it says on page 6:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Another contrast with most countries in Europe "—</p></blockquote>
having emphasised the point which my hon. Friends have emphasised, that in Europe they treat invalidity pensioners more generously by giving them earnings-related benefits—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is that, although generous earnings-related benefits are provided under Britain's National Insurance scheme during the first six months of sickness, at the end of that time the benefit automatically falls to a flat rate. Retirement pensions and widows' pensions are also primarily flat-rate benefits. The present Government is now promoting plans for virtually all employees to belong to an occupational pension scheme or alternatively to a State-sponsored 'reserve scheme' in order to save towards additional retirement and widows' pensions related to their future earnings. Quite illogically, comparable invalidity benefits do not feature in these plans and people who develop a prolonged incapacity for work will have no statutory entitlement to an earnings-related invalidity pension."</p></blockquote>
We are trying to graft on to the immediate maturity of the present provisions this commitment to give these people a statutory entitlement to an earnings-related invalidity pension. The Paper goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Yet the provision of such a pension is the pattern in most European countries. It was envisaged under the previous Government's National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill, though not as generously as DIG would have wished. But the White Paper Strategy for Pensions treats the problem as though it did not exist, implying that the present Government considers it too difficult to solve in the context of its own alternative to the Crossman plan. Instead in the National Insurance Act, 1971"—</p></blockquote>
we are dealing here with Amendments to that Act—
	<br><blockquote><p>"it has modified the basic National Insurance scheme by changing the name of the existing flat-rate sickness benefit to 'invalidity pension' after six months' incapacity for work and supplementing it by a small extra 'invalidity allowance'. At the same time"—</p></blockquote>
I want to be fair—
	<br><blockquote><p>"it has raised the supplements for children to the higher level formerly payable only for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
children of widows and retirement pensioners. "These changes provide some immediate relief to families not qualifying for means-tested allowances under the Supplementary Benefits scheme but do nothing to prevent the gap widening in future between earnings-related retirement and widows' pensions on the one hand and flat-rate invalidity pensions on the other."</p></blockquote>
This is the heart of our argument. The Paper goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"And people whose earning power has been drastically reduced by disability are still left without any benefit at all (with the exception of the means-tested 'family income supplement' …)"</p></blockquote>
I come to some of the objections which the hon. Gentleman has made to our scheme. He said it was unfair and would exclude all sorts of people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I bring a point to my right hon. Friend's attention? She has already refuted the statement made by the Minister a few moments ago on the basis of what the Disability Income Group says. May I point out that with an older man or woman receiving invalidity allowances at the rate of 35p, when it is increased, the Crossman scheme would only have to be running for a year for an older man on average national earnings to catch up with that invalidity allowance. Every year thereafter, he surges ahead. The hon. Gentleman's specific allegation against the Crossman scheme is quite unjustified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is an expert on these complex issues in the relative merits of superannuation schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the right hon. Lady will agree that, to complete the picture, she ought to read the next two sentences of the DIG Paper. The first sentence of the next paragraph is important. This explains the warm welcome that DIG has given to the progress that has been made in immediate help in the last two years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was intending to. I have it marked. It is an important part of my argument. I was going on to point out that DIG deals with some of the points which the hon. Gentleman made against our Amendments, some of the "unfairness and anomalies" which he said fouled them up. The Paper says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"DIG recognise that invalidity pensions related to earnings would be limited to those who become disabled in the future and whose disability occurs during working life. They could
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
not, for example, help people disabled from childhood who are never able to work; for them an appropriate flat-rate pension ought to be available without any test of means".</p></blockquote>
That is the answer to the hon. Gentleman's criticism. The Paper goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nevertheless if, as a community one of our aims is to protect living standards when earnings cease, it is just as important to improve the benefits payable in future years when the cause is disability as when it is death or advancing years. The Government's proposals for an earnings-related widow's pension without a corresponding invalidity pension makes social and economic nonsense and an earnings-related retirement pension at the age of 65 (60 for women) does nothing to lessen it. DIG believes that the time to face this fact is now".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman has been answered out of the mouth of the disabled themselves. We recognise that earnings-related schemes do more for the better off. We recognise, too, that there will be a continuing need for adequate flat-rate provision without means testing for those who cannot qualify. This is exactly what our Amendment does, graft the principle of earnings-related payment in future on to the flat-rate principle necessary as a fall-back position for everyone. Yet the hon. Gentleman has been telling us how difficult it will be to do this grafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to him regretfully, as I had to say at our first Sitting, that I think his motives are quite different from what he pretends to the Committee. I do not think that he is concerned with the social consequences of our Amendment. He is concerned with one fact, and the Secretary of State himself gave the game away in answer to a Question from one of his hon. Friends the other day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are concerned not to make the State provision in this respect so good that the occupational pension schemes either become relatively unattractive or have to be brought up to the level of the State scheme. My hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) was right. If we want to deal with this in private occupational schemes, it should be made a condition of those schemes. That is a simple way of doing it, rather than have the Government sitting back and twiddling their thumbs and hoping it will happen. The Government can control the situation by saying that,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>having put such a provision in the State scheme, the private schemes must do at least as well.</p>

	<p>Their approach is quite the opposite. They say that if they put such a provision into the Bill, it will be awkward because they will have to tell the private occupational schemes to follow suit, and they are not prepared to impose those standards. This was clear in an Answer the Secretary of State gave to the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Astor) on 11th May. The hon. Member asked the Secretary of State:
	<br><blockquote><p>"by how much he estimated that the 4 per cent. contribution to the proposed Reserve Scheme must be increased if the accrued retirement pension as forecast in the White Paper, Strategy for Pensions, is payable within any period in which a member is entitled to invalidity pension under the national insurance scheme".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>The Secretary of State replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If such provision were to be made, the contribution for men would probably need to be increased to between 4¼ per cent. and 4½ per cent. But, as a counterpart, occupational schemes would have to be required to provide invalidity cover for employees exempted from the reserve scheme and I am not satisfied that this would be practicable".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 11th May, 1972; Vol. 836, 
	<i>c</i>. 434.]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>Now, does the Committee have the facts clear? Now do we know what the argument is about? If these Amendments are accepted, or the principle of them, because we do not pretend that they are perfectly drafted, the Government would have to require occupational schemes to do the same, and they do not consider that that is practicable. Let us have less high-falutin' talk, let us face the political realities behind this and the Government's resistance to it. My hon. Friends and I will press the Amendment to a Division. We believe that our proposal would meet the pleas of the disabled, and we believe that ways could be found of grafting this earnings-related principle on to the basis of flat-rate benefits for the disabled and chronic sick. I hope that the Committee will support us.</p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendments would raise the level of retirement pension and all the other figures, uprating them not by 12 per cent. as proposed in the Bill but by 33⅓ per cent. This may seem to be a radical, dramatic and Utopian proposal, but it detracts not at all from the force of the importance of the Amendment to say that it is still a relatively modest Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 5 raises the level of the single person's pension from £6 to £8 which, in terms of the proportion of national average earnings, raises it from about 20 per cent. to around 27 per cent. In the light of the pension arrangements in the larger area which we are about to join our proposal is in no sense dramatic, radical or Utopian, because those other countries do considerably better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are doing no more than carrying to its conclusion the Government's own logic. The Government made clear on Second Reading that the purpose of the uprating is to restore the purchasing power to the pension and to all the related welfare benefits. That is the increase of 75p. It is well known that in the Budget, the Government, in an attempt to reflate the economy, had large sums to distribute and managed to raise the tax threshold—and we wholly support this proposal—
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
in every household by a pound. This goes to every earning household where there is at least one person earning and above the tax threshold. Since there are few pensioners who pay tax, because they earn or have a large occupational pension—about a fifth perhaps—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figure is about a third.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then we are talking about a substantial majority. These are persons with whom the Bill is concerned, the two-thirds beneath the tax threshold. The Government have given £1 a week to everybody else, but nothing to the two-thirds of pensioners who are beneath the tax threshold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In seeking to restore purchasing power, the Government have given £1 a week to the rest of the population, which takes the figure to £7.75p. Therefore, we are not far off with our figure of £8. A 25p topping up is the least we can do at a time when the Government have been able to give away £3,000 million. We are doing nothing more than taking the Government's logic to its own conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not want to mislead the Committee. He is comparing £1 off tax for earning households with 75p for the pensioner. I am sure that he would wish to remind the Committee that for the married couple the comparison is with £1.20p, the increase which the married couple will have on their pension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept that point, but we are talking also about single pensioners. I am prepared to take a midpoint between 75p and £1.20p; but, whatever the figure, the hon. Gentleman will concede that it is a question of restoration of purchasing power to a household, and the only reason for the figure of £1.20p in some cases is the consideration that there are two individuals and not one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are asking not only for a restoration of purchasing power but also for the £1 extra which the rest of the population have received but which two-thirds of pensioners have not. We have heard the Under-Secretary of State say that resources should be concentrated on the less well off. This is an 
	<i>argumentum ad hominem</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I follow the point of that intervention. Was the hon. Gentleman saying that the lower paid are having their contributions increased by smaller amounts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concede that. The Opposition wholly support proposals to take the load off the lower paid and to have a more progressively graduated system by raising national insurance contributions for the higher paid. But that is a different point from the one I am making now, on the question of benefits and making sure that they go to those at the lowest level. If the Government can give this money to the higher paid, we insist that it should also go to the lower paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should be said that Labour policy, over a number of years, has been not only that the contributions of the lower paid are not to be increased, but that they should be substantially decreased. That was one of the main principles of the National Superannuation Scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that. It is true that a shift from a regressive flat-rate system to a proportional system, such as was proposed in the Crossman scheme, is beneficial to the lower paid not only because it increases disproportionately the level of benefit but because it reduces the amount they have to pay in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of making sure pensioners are not left out in the cold, I wish to refer to a part of the speech made by the Secretary of State on Second Reading. It was a thoroughly misleading statement that must be set right. The Secretary of State must have known what he was doing, and certainly the officials behind him must also have known what he was doing. Yet deliberate confusion was made between the restoration of purchasing power and the question of extra assistance. The right hon. Gentleman then said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I remind the House that, taking a 13-month period, the recipients of national insurance benefits and corresponding benefits received a £1 increase last September and next October will
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
receive an increase of 75p, making a total increase of £1.75 for a single person over about the same period as the taxpayer has received a £1 weekly benefit."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 18th May, 1972; Vol. 837. 
	<i>c</i>. 718.]</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman was trying to make out that the 75p which the pensioner will receive next October compares favourably with the £1 given in the Budget to the rest of the population, because we also have to take account of the £1 increase in September last. But the £1 increase and the 75p are aimed at restoring purchasing power because of the effects of inflation and have nothing to do with the £1 which has gone to the rest of the population. Had the Government been in the severest economic straits—we are delighted to see that, as a result of the economic situation we bequeathed them, they are not—they would still have given these kind of increases. They might have been slightly less, but would have been similar. The increase of £1 is a separate matter. We are saying that the pensioners should get the £1 increase which the Government have felt able to give to the rest of the population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, that extra £1 to the rest of the population has been devalued by the amount of increase in contributions, so the rest of the population are not getting the whole of that £1. If one were to increase the old age pension by the £1 proposed, one would decrease the £1 going to the rest of the population. It is not a fair comparison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, there are other effects within the total package, but to suggest, particularly for the higher paid, that there is a reduction which is at all comparable is incorrect. Certainly, one did not notice hon. Members opposite leaping up to correct the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he repeatedly made the point about the £1 increase which he had given to the population at large. This is no more than a minor reduction in the force of my point and does not meet it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to make his point, the Under-Secretary has been picking on the most favourable to him. We favour a substantial increase in Exchequer supplement, which has been considerably reduced since 1948. In that way. we would place the burden increasingly on the broadest backs. We would also be favouring a more progressively graduated system of contributions at the higher income levels. It is not the case that there is a 
	<i>quid pro quo</i> here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I maintain that the pensioners are being left out in the cold. We are seeking to put them back by the fire by giving them £1, which is given to the rest of the population and which they are at present denied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was by way of an 
	<i>excursus</i>, to put the point in Government terms. We have our own reasons for thinking that the pension should be substantially higher. I want, first, to say why we believe that £6.75 is quite inadequate. Second, I appreciate your anxiety, Sir Stephen about our keeping in order, but the question of social justice and the wider argument is unavoidable on this Amendment, even if it is to be excluded or reduced on other Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third, I want to deal with the question of what the pension should be, given the level of affluence in Western societies and bearing in mind what other societies achieve. I accept that we must talk about how it is to be paid for, and I want, last, to consider the counter-arguments of Government spokesmen from time to time against this kind of Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, why is £6.75 not enough for the single pensioner? To take one crucial commodity, the food price index has risen since November 1969 by 23 per cent. The pension which was given last September was an increase of 20 per cent. over the level of November 1969. To that
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
extent, it has been true for the last two or three months that pensioners in real terms are worse off than they were in November 1969. That will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no argument about this. The facts are taken from the 
	<i>Department of Employment Gazette</i> statistics, which are a fairly arid but nevertheless relevant source of information in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are worse off, and will be progressively worse off as we move towards the October date of uprating. This means that the pensioners—it is true of them if of no one else—are having the effects of inflation unloaded on them, as on to those who are welfare dependants. No trade union would accept that situation. They have the sanctions to enforce their keeping up with the cost of living, and they use them—and I am fully in support of their doing at least that. But the pensioners do not have sanctions. They cannot withdraw their labour or appeal to anything but the sympathy and the conscience of the nation. In this Bill, that sympathetic and conscientious response has not been forthcoming. We are seeking to protect them from the effects of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only defence of the Secretary of State against this argument on Second Reading—again, it is a political argument—was that the rate of erosion of the pensions since last September has been no faster than in previous upratings by the last Government. I have not checked whether that is true—no doubt, it has been carefully worked out, and I am prepared to accept it—but the point is that pensioners do not shop around with declining percentages or with percentages which are declining less fast. what matters to them is the actual cash, and what matters is not just the rate of erosion but the level of increase of pension together with the level of erosion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we want for pensions is that the real increase should be preserved over the forthcoming review period for the whole of that time above the par value. In other words, if the pension before the last uprating was £5 and was raised to £6, then the very least that we would require—and the least that the trade unions would require for the working population—is that the £5 real value is maintained for the whole of the subsequent period before the next review following the increase to £6; in other words,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0627">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
that there would not be a loss of at least £1 in the subsequent review period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the very least that we can expect of a decent pension increase. If there is to be a rapid rate of erosion because of inflation—leaving aside all the controversial arguments about the reasons—from the point of view of the pensioners, it does not matter why; it matters that they be protected. The very least that one can do is to ensure that, if there is to be a rapid rate of inflation—the National Institute in its latest report makes clear that there will be—the level of increase must be enough to sustain the real value of the pension at the time of the increase throughout the subsequent review period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recent history of the pension shows the damage which has been done to pensioners. It was raised to £5 in November 1969, and again by £1 in September 1971, at which point the rate of inflation, again according to the official retail price index, had been 16 per cent. That is, the value of the £5 pension had fallen by September 1971 to about £4.20. It then received a boost of £1, which took it up to £5.20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in the middle of this period and it is impossible to say exactly what the rate of inflation will have been by October this year. But, from the way in which price rises have come down to 6 and 6½ per cent. and are now moving up again, it will be about 8 or 10 per cent. by October. If so, the level of the pension will have fallen by October, when the increase comes, bearing in mind that it is a 13-month and not a 12-month period—which is why it is, perhaps, slightly higher than one might think on the present 6½ per cent. annual rate of inflation—to about £4.70 or £4.80. Again, we will by then still be below the level in real terms of the pension in November 1969.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is then proposed to give a 75p increase, thus raising the pension to approximately £5.45. One then has to look along the period before the next review to November 1973. In that period, all that one can say is that the National Institute, the most weighty and informed ouside body for predicting the course of the economy in terms of prices, wages and other economic indices, suggests a rate of between 7 and 10 per cent. in price inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
By November 1973, therefore, one can expect the pension again to be back towards the level of about £4.85. This is my point. Bearing in mind the rate of inflation and the economic problem of just keeping up which pensioners have, they are being fobbed off with a pension which, by November 1973 or October 1972, whichever one cares to take, will not be worth the value that it had in November 1969.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. David Madel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In talking about the erosion of the pension and price and wage inflation, does not the hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I am escaping the point of that intervention if I say that that is not my business. I could do as the hon.

I would gladly do so, and I can do nothing else if I am to answer this point. If I am in order, I will—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would resist the temptation. I agree that almost anything is in order on these Amendments, but it would be helpful if we did not stray too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very much the view that I would take. We could have a very interesting discussion, but it is likely to be side-tracked away from the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever economic policy one pursues, the pensioner has to be protected. This is so irrespective of the question whether wage inflation is too high or whether, with the level of redistribution which has gone on, one can expect wage-earners, particularly low wage-earners, to hold back in their wage claims. It is entirely fair to make the point that, whatever economic policy one pursues, the pensioner has to be protected. If we had a prices and incomes policy and a board containing a person nominated by pensioner organisations, or even a housewife—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your assistance, Sir Stephen.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best, Sir Stephen, to resist the temptation. I merely say that I accept that point. I hope that it will also be accepted—this is the point I am making—that the level of pension is not enough, that pensioners are worse off than 2½ years ago, and will be worse off again after they have received this increase, as we move through the review period taking us to November 1973. That is the crucial point, that £6.75p is not enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Surely, he should be comparing like with like, the £4.85 with the figure before it was increased in 1969. Is not that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point about inflation. It is a fair point. I only plead that it does not in any way diminish my argument.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman correct the figure he quoted? Will he take the figure before the rise in 1969 and compare it with the pension in 1973?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. Gentleman listened to what I was saying. One can take different 
	<i>points d'appui</i>—to take a phrase from the Common Market—but if one is consistent throughout, one produces those results. It took me a little time to establish these figures. One could go away and come back with new figures, but the point will remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a party point. I appreciate that there is the exception of 1965—it is not unfair to cite that—but it has always been true that at some stage well before the end of the review period the real value of the pension in relation to the par value prior to the beginning of the review period has declined. The pensioner has always been worse off in real terms at the end than at the beginning. This is still continuing, and that is why we want to jack up the pension in such a way as to prevent it happening this time, on the basis that the rest of the population had their pound a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that that has always been the situation and that, if one takes a certain point between reviews one can always adduce the sort of figures he is giving. But does he not welcome the fact that that will be slightly more difficult in future because of the initiation of the annual review?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, but I do not think that that is a relevant intervention. We are in agreement about the annual review. That is not a justified interjection to make against the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0629">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
Back benchers on both sides were recommending an annual review long before the present Government instituted it. The opening speech for the Opposition of my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) at that time made clear that the level of inflation was such that it would be impossible not to do it. There is agreement on both sides about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point from which hon. Members have sought to deflect me. The pension increases are not enough to ensure that the pensioner over the period before the next review will be at least as well off at the end of it as at the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to be the required minimum. No decent trade union worth its salt will provide for an increase that does not take account of anticipated inflation as well as past inflation, to restore purchasing power and, hopefully, a little more for its members. We are doing precisely that. We are translating into pension and welfare terms what is happening to the rest of the economy in terms of wage bargaining. That is the first argument why £6.75 is not enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the second argument, to which we give considerable weight. This is the last uprating—if we go by the vote last night and subsequent votes—before this country enters the EEC. Accession is due on 3rd January, which will be 11 months before the next uprating. We therefore have to take account not only of the normal and expected rate of inflation but the fact that the Common Market will make a difference to the standard of living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I in no way wish to drag up the whole of the Common Market debate except to say that it is agreed on both sides that the Common Market will make a difference to the standard of living of everyone. The dynamic effects may make a positive contribution in due time, but in the short term it will increase the cost of living. There is no doubt about that. It may be ½ per cent. a year, the Government's lowest figure. It may be considerably more, as various persons have claimed and outside bodies have purported to prove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase to £6.75 is merely restoration in terms of the impact of entering the Common Market and the gradual transition into VAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
I will quote one attempt that has been made by an outside body called the Trade Policy Research Centre based in England, composed of a group of agricultural economists, some of whom are favourable to the EEC. That body has looked at the likely income distribution effects of entry into the EEC on low income groups, high income groups and also pensioners. I quote from page 71 of the Trade Policy Research Centre document, because its findings are important:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Expressed as a proportion of income, poverty families and pensioners spend about 5 per cent. of final income on farm support, whilst high-income households pay 1.3 per cent. These highest income families benefit by a change from deficiency-payment to EEC support methods by approximately £8 a year."</p></blockquote>
This is the crucial sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At the same time single-pensioner households lose by £16 and two-pensioner households lose by £30 a year. The heaviest burden is carried by poverty families which lose by £33 a year."</p></blockquote>
What provision is being made for them under the Bill? That is not an unfair question. The effect, involving an increase of 60p to 65p a week in the case of pensioner households, will not all come at once. We shall have a transitional period. However, it will come at least partly in the first year. One can imagine that it will be about one-fifth, or perhaps rather more, in the initial year, a significant increase which seems not to have been taken into account by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter remains not entirely knowable. We do not know what will happen regarding tax on food. The Government have repeatedly denied that there was any attempt to impose VAT on food. All one can say is that the other Community countries have VAT on food. We on this side would be surprised if, within a short period, it did not happen. We also expect VAT to be harmonised. We have spoken this morning about harmonisation of taxes and certainly that will occur. The Chancellor made great play about imposing VAT at the lowest rate which applies on the Continent, where the range is between 10 per cent. and 23 per cent. VAT has been imposed at 10 per cent. It will be surprising if VAT is not harmonised upwards to around 15 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the reasons given in this pamphlet—I will not go over the exact points about how a variable import levy rather than a deficiency payment system affects low income households and pensioners
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0630">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
and so on—the consensus is that there is that effect and it cannot be denied. There will be a significant cost of living effect this year which there has not been in previous years. What component of the 75p increase is supposed to take account of that? As far as we can see, there is none.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recommending to the Committee an increase of £2, we are at least taking true account of that factor. One can say that some of the 25p topping up above the £6.75 can be regarded as taking account of these special increases that would not otherwise have occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an important third reason why we believe that £6.75 is not enough. That is the sheer ungenerosity of alternative concessions which are made to pensioners. Fo rexample, some are provided free, or at nominal charges, with TV licences, television services, concessionary travel fares, meals and various other concessions. We are all familiar with these concessions. However, they are few in coverage and relatively small in size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whenever we ask for an increase in these concessions there are objections. I know this because, for my sins, I am a member of the Finance Bill Standing Committee. When we argued for the removal of television and telephone services for the elderly from the effects of VAT, we were told that these concessions could not be granted because it would be inefficient and that one should not interfere with the price mechanism—it was administratively too cumbersome to pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
vide these special concessions in a wide-based tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were told the answer was to provide an increase in the pension. We were told that the best way to assist people is to give them the money and allow them to choose. We entirely agree—give them the opportunity. We are asking here that pensioners should have the opportunity to choose. But if they are to be given only 75p, which does no more than restore lost purchasing power, where does the opportunity to choose come from?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trouble is that one tends to go round in circles, and run the danger of going out of order. When one raises on the Finance Bill the matter of assistance, one is told to ask for increased pensions. If I were to look at the various other mechanisms, fiscal and welfare, by which pensioners can be assisted, no doubt, Sir Stephen, you would get anxious about order and say that this is not the relevant Committee. We never seem able to make a significant impact at the right point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It cannot always be said that one has to go to another source for income. It is the most cynical and immoral buck passing. At whichever Committee or on whatever Bill one brings this point up, one is always referred somewhere else—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
