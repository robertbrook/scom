	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Marcus Fox</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 241, in page 50, line 24, leave out "twenty-one" and insert "eighteen".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment it will be convenient to take Amendment No. 636, in page 50, line 24, after "years", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"(or, in the case of a member of a parish or community council, eighteen years)".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fox</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some weeks ago I put a Parliamentary Question to my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office, regarding the age, not just for local elections, but parliamentary elections. I received rather a dusty answer. This morning I hope there will be an improvement on that. All that one can hope to do in the Amendment is to reduce the age at which one can be nominated for local elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) is not here, since Amendment No. 636 in his name is being considered at the same time. Amendment No. 636 seeks to limit this reduction of age to one type of election, namely to parish or community councils. I hope that he has done this as a safety measure in case my Amendment is not successful. Here is a golden opportunity to put something right which I think is inevitable. [
	<i>Interruption</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I appreciate that the usual channels must conduct their conversations, but regrettably, they can be heard here on the platform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fox</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Sir Stephen. The golden opportunity I refer to is one which follows inevitably from the reduc-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1402</span>
tion of the voting age from 21 to 18. In the Bill we are concerned too often with the past. On many Clauses this is inevitable, but on this Clause, and this Amendment in particular, I appeal to hon. Members to think about the future of local government. It is a unique opportunity for us to add a new dimension to the Bill, not in any way on a political basis. If any hon. Members on this Committee read a certain newspaper, I am accused from time to time of being political—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. Gentleman means party political, not political. What is the object, if not political?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fox</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give whatever interpretation the hon. Gentleman wants. I will not repeat the arguments produced under the previous Administration as to why the age was reduced to 18. We had a General Election with these 3 million electors able to use their vote. On this side of the Committee we all agree that that did not result in a disaster; indeed, in so far as it brought me to this House, I would say the opposite applies. We now treat 18-year-olds as mature, with respect to owning property, contracting marriage, exercising the vote and other legal responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a natural development and we ought to anticipate the justness of the case. Rather than hold back, I would appeal to the Minister to accept earlier rather than later the need for this reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this Amendment is agreed to, our council chambers will not be inundated with 18-year-olds, 19-year-olds or 20-year-olds; our selection committees do not work in this way. I made four attempts before I was elected to my own local council. I am convinced that it will reduce the average of the members of our councils, and this to my mind is the most important aspect of this Amendment. The average age on our councils in the past has been far too high. If it means that we lower the average age by a few years, who can really object? It will also provide a means of service for those few citizens in that age group who wish to serve in this way. There will be critics; every proposal to extend the franchise has been opposed, usually on the grounds that new voters are not capable of acting rationally or making political judgments. I hardly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0763">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1403</span>
think that that can be produced in this Committee as an argument for refusing this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do we limit and restrict this age group simply to voting and not serving? There are 18, 19 and 20-year-olds who could not care less about anything; there are those who are starry-eyed idealists, those who are self-centred and immature, some are hard working—[
	<i>Interruption</i>]—I am talking about my Front Bench now. Some are hard working and industrious, and others who are a great credit to their families.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Swain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that if the hon. Gentleman had as many blisters on his hands as on his backside, he might be classed as industrious. If he is referring to my absence from this Committee. I have been attending to my duties elsewhere on behalf of the miners, and trying to do it to the best of my ability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fox</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I can say to the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-east (Mr. Swain) is that if the cap fits, he had better wear it. [
	<i>Interruption</i>].</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have a running fire of sedentary interruptions. [
	<i>Interruption</i>]. I must ask the hon. Member not to continue to interrupt from a seated position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fox</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has quite misunderstood what I was saying; I will leave it at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is enough confusion in the minds of young people in this country without adding to it by maintaining the anomaly that is apparent by the need for this Amendment. In the debate of the previous Parliament, a phrase was used, "fit to fight, fit to vote". I suggest that "fit to represent" should be added to it. I hope my hon. Friend will accept this Amendment, as I feel that there is a need for participation by people in this age group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a lifelong opponent of blood sports, I would not dream of doing any fox-hunting in any shape or form in this Commitee. It is rather pleasant, if unusual, to find myself agreeing with a certain amount of what the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox) has just said. In the Second Reading debate, I first asked the Secretary of State why the qualifying age for a local government candidate was 21 in the Bill and not 18.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1404</span>
The Secretary of State, very properly and fairly, asked the Minister for Local Government why this was so; the Minister for Local Government, very properly and fairly, replied that he did not know. This is the position we have reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically this follows a train of thought, as the hon. Gentleman has said quite rightly, "Fit to fight, fit to vote". The stage immediately before that was the Latey Report and its implementations. "Fit to fight, fit to take your place as an adult citizen, fit to make contracts, fit to marry without parental consent, fit to buy and sell land, fit to make wills"—this is the law as it stands. That was the second stage in the process. If "fit to make a contract and fit to marry", why not "fit to vote"? That was the third stage we reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we are reaching the fourth stage. What we are concerned with, Sir Stephen, as you will point out to me if I go too far from the main point, is a Local Government Bill. We are concerned with nothing but whether, bearing in mind those three previous stages, somebody of 18 should be entitled to stand as a councillor in local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not necessarily share the belief of the hon. Member for Shipley that there will be a sudden, dramatic drop in the age limit of our councils. It may not make all that much difference. It may be that here or there one will find a bright 21, 20 or 19-year-old who will, in fact, become a councillor if that Amendment succeeds. It is quite possible, but it certainly will not be universal. The horrible spectre of Greater London, for example, being dominated by 100 18-year-old councillors and, until the Under-Secretary for State grants the hon. Lady her request about aldermen, by 16 18-year-old aldermen, is merely a nightmare that can be conjured up. It will not happen that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen, if the Amendment succeeds, is that in this field, if there really is a bright, intelligent and active young man or woman who previously would have been barred because of the 21 year age disqualification, he or she will be able to offer himself or herself as a candidate in the elections. It will then be up to the electorate to decide whether they think the candidate too young or should be rejected on other grounds. That is all it does. It tidies things up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not at this moment arguing that there should be a universal application of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0764">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1405</span>
this rule. I need time to consider whether it should apply in other fields. I believe I am right in saying that there are different age limits, for example, in the United States Congress and in the House and in the Senate. There always were in France in its many Republics. Quite what rules there are in the Sixth—or whatever Republic we have now reached—I am afraid I do not know. Certainly it was true that in the past there was an age differentiation; and I have no doubt that this is true in many other countries in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are concerned with, however, is local government. We have all of us agreed that we want local government to be allied with local democracy, to come nearer to the people in doing so. We are confessing, frankly, that local government has failed the people a little over the years, perhaps because of the change in events, but we certainly want to make a new start if we can now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we succeed and if the Amendment, which I heartily support, succeeds, we shall have done two things. First we shall have approached much nearer to the ordinary electors. Secondly we shall give young and able people a chance to play their part, perhaps as a first stage in the governing of their country. For that reason I should like to give my support from this side of the Committee to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Richard Sharples)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful to the Committee if I were to intervene at this stage. This is a most important debate and I think it right to give, at an early stage, the Government's point of view, and also my own views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what both my hon. Friend the right hon. Gentleman said in putting forward the main argument. Once the Latey Committee's Report was accepted by Parliament and once the right to vote at 18 was accepted—and this side of the House had a free vote on that—in logic one extended the whole range of responsibility to those who are in the age group 18-21. This is the direction in which opinion is tending to move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But having said that, I should sound a note of caution to the Committee. The questions raised by this Amendment should be discussed in a wider forum than this Committee. This is something about which reactions from people even
	<span class='label label-info column'>1406</span>
in the age group that we are discussing are very divided. I am thinking of the various conflicting recommendations which have come forward from the Young Conservative Organisation and also from the conversations that I have had with many young people. I take the point which was made by the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) that this is a matter which ought to be raised but upon which there should be some time for reflection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a second reason why I would advise the Committee to exercise caution about this. The Amendment put down by my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) is in terms of extending this idea only to parish councils. The main Amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox) was that one should extend the right to stand for election at 18 to local authorities generally. In logic one is bound to accept that, if this is accepted for local government, inevitably, within a comparatively short time, the principle will be accepted for Parliament itself. As I understood it, this was very much the argument put forward by my hon. Friend. We have given a great deal of consideration to this. It is a matter which probably cuts across party lines as did the right to vote at 18. There is no particular party view on whether 18 or 21 is right. Hon. Members on both sides will probably have their own definite views about this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the request of my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, when I saw that this Amendment was coming forward, I had discussions last week with the hon. Lady the Member for Mitcham (Mrs. Shirley Williams) who is shadow Home Secretary and also with the Leader of the Liberal Party. They agreed with me that a possible reduction in the age for parliamentary candidature was a matter appropriate for consideration by a Speaker's Conference. We think this is a matter which should have the full consideration of a Speaker's Conference, and then, if such a change were accepted for Parliament as a result of a recommendation from a Speaker's Conference, we would accept it also for local authorities, including parish councils. This should be discussed as a separate issue in the House of Commons on the basis of membership of the House of Commons, the primary body in this country, rather than coming in through the back door by its gradual extension through
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0765">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1407</span>
the different fields of local government and then becoming inevitably accepted as a 
	<i>fait accompli</i> so far as Parliament was was concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Speaker has agreed that there should be a Speaker's Conference and that this matter should be on the agenda, and other matters will come forward for discussion at the same time. I believe that this is the right way of doing it. I believe that we should consider it in its widest context. We should give time for the full range of opinion and the full implications to be discussed properly. My recommendation to the Committee is that this is the right way of handling it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fundamentally disagree with the Minister, and I shall support the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox) wholeheartedly. This Committee is given terms of reference by the House of Commons to deal with the Bill and to amend it if it thinks necessary and wise. The Minister seems to me to be taking out of the hands of the Committee a responsibility which has already been vested in it by the House of Commons, not only on Second Reading, but in Standing Committee D of the Bill upstairs. If I remember rightly, there was a vole which sent the Bill upstairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, as a member of the Committee, am prepared to carry out my obligations, as I hope other hon. Members are, strictly in accordance with the terms of reference. So I hope the Committee will disagree with the hon. Gentleman, however diligent he has been in trying to discuss it with people who are not members of the Committee, who did not volunteer to be members of the Committee, who had no intention of being members of the Committee, and as a consequence should have no influence over the discussions in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is where the hon. Gentleman and I disagree, because if this is accepted as a precedent, then in the case of any Clause of a Bill which is ambiguous, to say the least, and embarrassing to the Government, to say the worst, the excuse or reasons given by the hon. Gentleman could be justifiably applied, if a precedent is created this morning. Therefore, I hope that the Committee accepts its responsibilities. Whether the vote goes for or against the Amendment, if a vote is taken, is immaterial at this moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1408</span>
In supporting the hon. Member for Shipley, who ably moved the Amendment, I should like to say that I think it is the experience of many of us that, as young men in the political movement, that we were told by our elders that wisdom in politics came with grey hair. I, perhaps, broke through that barrier at an early age and am continuing to try to break through barriers, be it by violence or peaceful picketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was 30 years old, I was the chairman of my council, having served for almost nine years on that council. That was one of my proudest achievements, since, as a young man, I broke through a barrier into local government. I was the youngest man ever to represent the Labour Party on the Derby County Council. Why then should we object to young people breaking through this barrier?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to say that there is a safeguard—and I believe that both major political parties try as far as possible to make this safeguard work—in preventing such a thing described by my right hon. Friend the Member forDeptford (John Silkin) as the horrific experience of having more than 100 members of about 18 years of age on the London Council. The two major parties have always accepted their responsibilities by careful selection of candidates for local elections. As much care and attention is taken in the Labour Party, at least, in the selection of candidates for local authorities as there is of candidates for parliamentary seats. That safeguard is, therefore, already built in to protect any irresponsible youth from representing a major party in local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not use the emotional phrase "old enough to fight, old enough to vote". That, in itself, does not carry much weight. If a person is old enough to conduct his own analysis and arrive at conclusions from that analysis, I consider him old and responsible enough to act as a responsible member of a local government. If this were eventually to apply also to Parliament, I should welcome it, because it is high time we had new visions both in local government and in Parliament. For example my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East (Mr. Barry Jones) has come to the house at the age of 26. By the time he is 30 years old he will be as much a fixture as is the statue of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0766">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1409</span>
Churchill in the Lobby, because he will accept the traditions of the House. I do not say that with any disrespect to my hon. Friend, but it is a fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been here for 13 years and have seen men of vision come. Within a few months they have become part and parcel of the establishment. On the Conservative benches it is because they have been ambitious of becoming Ministers and on our benches it is because they have the ambition of becoming parliamentary representatives. I feel that if we can accept our responsibilities as Committee Members and vote for the Amendment this morning, the hon. Gentleman will have plenty of time between now and Report to solicit the aid of his hon. Friends or the hon. and learned Members in the Opposition, who are perhaps in a position to advise him. If the hon. Member can learn definitely whether there is to be a Speaker's Conference, perhaps something could then be done on Report or earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are concerned with local government. Surely it would be possible both to have this Amendment carried, and, at the same time, refer the rest to the Speaker's Conference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Providing this Committee accepts this Amendment this morning, or votes upon it, I do not mind. We shall be carrying out our responsibilities, but I hope we are carrying them out in the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman moved the Amendment, with the sole intention of making it possible for young men and women of 18 years of age to accept their responsibilities within organised society, to be representaives on local authorities, to bring new vision into local authorities, and I am sure that we shall be creating a situation in the future that can bring nothing but good to society as we know it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Janet Fookes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much inclined to accept the Amendment. I think the grounds put forward for lowering the age are powerful ones. I believe that we have a fetish with age. One is either too young, or, after a very short time indeed, one is too old. I can well recall the misgivings of my elders when I put myself forward at the age of 22, simply on grounds of age. I think one should look
	<span class='label label-info column'>1410</span>
far more to a person's talents and capabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I accept my hon. Friend's view that this raises wider issues, especially regarding parliamentary seats. I wonder whether it would be possible to have some kind of compromise, so that although we do not alter the age in the Bill, there should be some Clause or regulation put in so that it could be very easily altered, to avoid the Bill being mutilated, so to speak, very shortly afterwards. Would this be a suitable compromise at which my hon. Friend could look?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we ought to view this proposal further. I agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) has said, because I have been very conscious recently of the numbers of young people under the age of 21 who are playing a very active part indeed in major local government, welfare work, and taking initiative in a wide range of activities, and also taking a very responsible part in the strike claims committees. Many of these are people whom we want to take part in local government. I do not want to see them ruled out at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I completely accept that we have built in already our sieving process and, as my hon. Friend says, it is quite a tough one. Therefore, there is very little danger of a flood of younger people. That may be regarded as a pity, but nevertheless we want the opportunity of encouraging a limited number of those who are taking part. I see no reason why they should be omitted. At the end of the day any decision is in the hands of the electorate and any absurb flood will be checked by the electorate concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very sympathetic to the view that we should accept the Amendment. I also agree with the idea of setting up a Speaker's Conference for the wider implications whic hare not yet within the scope of this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Morrison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had a good deal of sympathy with the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) when he reminded the Committee that power had been vested in the Committee to make a decision in respect of every item in the Bill. Apart from that general proposition, obviously I am sympathetic

to the selected Amendment and to my own Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, there is great force. in the argument put forward by my hon. Friend the Minister of State that this matter should be considered in a wider forum. Whatever may be contained in the Bill, wider considerations do arise in matters of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the question of representation at the age of 18 is to be considered by a Speaker's Conference, I hope that that Speaker's Conference will not be too tidy in its conclusions or recommendations. There are strong arguments in favour of creating anomalies. I do not see why it should not be possible for 18-year-olds to be councillors at one level whilst not being councillors at a higher level. I hope this point will be made strongly at the Speaker's Conference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Amendment concerns parish councils. In this sphere of local government there are strong practical arguments in favour of representation at the age of 18, and there is a precedent for an anomaly. The strong practical arguments are that, at that level, parish councils are concerned to a considerable degree in the provision and management of facilities used and needed by young people, more than by old people, who are looked after more by the other tiers of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if it were decided that at district and county level the responsibilities were too great for an 18-year-old to assume, that argument would not hold much water with regard to representation on parish councils. Parish councils could act as a good training ground for young people on the way to being elected as councillors in the other tiers of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the precedent in respect of parish councils, I am informed that the precedent is the Local Government Act, 1894, under which, no doubt to the amazement of large sectors of the population at that time and probably to the horror of a few other sectors of the population, women were allowed to be elected to parish councils. This was the first sphere of government, central or local, in which women were allowed to represent the community as councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there is this precedent in respect of parish councils, and I hope that the Speaker's Conference will take note of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1412</span>
this. As I say, in the light of this, there is nothing new in creating another anomaly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not press my hon. Friend further, but I have considerable sympathy with the main Amendment, and obviously support my own Amendment. I hope that the Speaker's Conference will show understanding and sympathy in the light of the times in which we live and the increased responsibility among large sections of young people who nowadays would be perfectly capable of representing others on councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not supported the hon. Member in the moving of the Amendment, but he will recall that when he asked his Question in the House, I suggested to him that he might table an Amendment of this nature. I am glad to sec that he has done this. The hon. Gentleman might have deployed his case a little better, but perhaps he has been a little over-trained and peaked too soon. This matter is so clear-cut that he could have come straight to the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, in his intervention, said that this had been the subject of a free vote. I accept this, and I accept that it was a free vote, unlike the charade on 28th October under the guise of a free vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will clarify one thing which he said for the benefit of hon. Members on this side of the Committee. He referred to consultations which had taken place with the Young Conservatives. Certainly, as far as I myself am concerned, it would be helpful if he would explain to me and probably some of my hon. Friends, just what age groups this compasses, because some of the people whom I recognise in my own locality as being members of the Young Conservatives are of somewhat mature years, to say the least.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Leaving aside the maturity of the Young Conservatives, just to put the record straight, I did not say there had been consultations. I said that views had been expressed but there have been no consultations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification and I hope that, if he speaks later, he will be able to help me on the question of the age range.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, while we are on the ques-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0768">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1413</span>
tion of helping the Committee with information, I understand the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) is anxious to catch your eye, Sir Stephen and, should he do so, may I suggest to him that, in view of the reactionary grumblings which we heard a little earlier, it would be useful if he were to help the Committee by telling us what period of history he specialised in, because it seems to be pre-1832.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the Amendment purely on the grounds of consistency in our national affairs. If a young person were to ask any member of the Committee today, if we should reject the Amendment, why we are not prepared to allow somebody of 18 years to put up for a local council, we should be very hard put to it to scratch together a convincing argument. I believe that the Amendment is part and parcel of a whole current of opinion running through our society and through world society as a whole, certainly the West European countries, which recognises that there is an earlier maturation of people nowadays and that this is reflected in different ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Press comments reference has been made to the fact that this will mean that people will leave school and become members of the council possibly straight away. We should remember that the majority of the population still leave school at 15, and, if this should come into operation, will have been in gainful employment for some three to four years at least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a natural development. Any fears that councils might be swamped with young people are quite groundless. It would, in fact, be a very healthy thing if the average age were substantially reduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that if a young man comes out of university, he starts work in management almost immediately, providing, of course that his father is in management also?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point my hon. Friend is making. I agree that there is some degree of nepotism in industry today. Things are not so bad as they were but, nevertheless, it is true to say that it is being found now that people who have been in the education system right until they begin work in their mid-twenties are perhaps not so well-equipped with the knowledge of life and experience as was at one time thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1414</span>
It has been stressed that not only will the electorate decide whether somebody of 18 goes on to the local council, but that the local selection conferences of the various parties in local government—Labour, Conservative, Citizen, Progressive or Moderates—will exercise their own sieving process. I do not therefore fear that the foundations of our country and constitution will be shaken by passing a very modest adjustment entirely in line with modern thinking. With regard to the Minister's point that a wider forum is needed, we are charged with a great weight of responsibility for remodelling the whole of local government for a very long time ahead. We have made tremendous decisions here regarding boundaries of authorities, and we shall be making similarly important decisions about functions, and I do not think it at all inconsistent that we should take this decision on the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to begin by replying to the hon. Member for Bristol South (Mr. Michael Cocks). The Committee will be vastly relieved to know that I specialised in 18th century history, and afterwards we can compare notes, as he was a geography master and, no doubt, specialised in the concept of the Flat Earth. My hon. Friend the Minister of State, was extremely wise to urge caution. There is not a single speech with which I have completely agreed or disagreed this morning; there is something in everything that I have felt that I could go along with. For this very reason it is right we should look at this matter in depth, and to refer it to a Speaker's Conference makes good sense. The fact that the Home Secretary, the Shadow Home Secretary and Mr. Speaker himself have all agreed that this is a right and proper course ought to guide us in our deliberations this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no Amendment on the Order Paper referring to a Speaker's Conference. It is only the Minister's suggestion, as even he does not yet know that it will be officially accepted as a point of discussion, although he has spoken to Mr. Speaker about it. The Amendment on the Order Paper is for discussion of a straightforward question, and the alternatives at the moment are hypothetical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's intervention was constructive, and this is a matter deserving consideration in depth. The Speaker's Conference is the right way to go about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman who just intervened very rightly talked about the constitutional duties of this Committee. This Committee consists of 45 members. Most of our colleagues will have strong feelings on this issue, and should like to have an opportunity to voice those feelings. I hope that as a result of our discussion this morning it will become generally known that this matter is to be referred to the Speaker's Conference, and people will then have the chance to let their views be heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a great deal in what my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) said. This is something where there are bound to be anomalies. We must accept the fact that any age limit—65 or 60 for retiring, or 18 for consuming alcohol—is bound to be arbitrary. We all accept this. In our advice bureaux we all come across extremely hard cases where an arbitrary line creates personal emotional difficulties. There may be a situation where somebody at the age of 17 is more mature than somebody of 18. One must draw the line somewhere. There was a great deal in what my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes said, that there might well be a case for 18-year-olds to serve on certain local councils, but not necessarily stand for election to this House. The hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) talked about other countries, where they have different age limits. In the United States, for instance, one must be 35 to stand for the Presidency, but one can stand at a much earlier age for Congress. The American people, in their wisdom, decided that this was a good thing. They too now have votes at 18, but nobody has suggested that the Presidential limit should be brought down to that level. At the end of the day we might decide that for parish councils, even for all local government elections, 18 is a realistic age limit, but not necessarily for Parliament. As one of the youngest Members of the House, I am the last person to want to keep out young people. However, there is a great deal to be said for serving some sort of apprenticeship. There is an inherent danger in the fact that at 18—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to my hon. Friend in a moment. He is reasonable and, no doubt, his intervention will be even more reasonable if he mulls it over a little longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are about to raise the school leaving age—rightly, most people think, although there are conflicting views. There will be more and more people of 18 still in full-time school education. It may not necessarily be the right thing that at that age they should be eligible to stand for election to this House. This is a matter which ought to be referred to a body such as the Speaker's Conference where it can be discussed at great length and in enormous detail, and recommendations could then be submitted to the House which would probably be acceptable to us all. I give way to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Reed</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may very well be right about the desirability of an apprenticeship and so on. The question is whether we, as legislators, should make that decision or whether the electors should make the decision as to what is an appropriate age to arrive here. I am for the electors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that we are going to make a decision, whether it be 18, 20 or 21. In voting for this Amendment, my hon. Friend would in effect be making a decision for the electors because they could not elect a 17-year-old. That does not hold a great deal of water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would strongly support the caution urged by my right hon. Friend. I hope that this will be referred to a Speaker's Conference, that it will be considered in detail and in depth and that we shall then have recommendations that will be acceptable to us all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support the Amendment moved by the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox). I was somewhat disappointed by the previous speaker who began by saying that he both agreed and disagreed with all the speakers. He seemed to be getting the worst of all worlds rather than the best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the Amendment purely on the grounds of logic. It does not make sense to me to say that a young person of 18 has the right to vote, to make that important decision, but cannot be chosen to stand for a local authority if the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0770">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1417</span>
electors so choose. That is an important point. The Minister is typical of all Ministers of all parties; as soon as they sit on those benches they become hyper-cautious. We were given thoughts of wider issues, and the word "caution" was used two or three times. There was also the hardy annual that, even if it was to be done, this was not the Bill or the time. What we did not get from the Minister was any idea as to whether the Government have a view on this issue of reducing the age to 18. We are entitled to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been talk of a Speaker's Conference. Whether it goes to a Speaker's Conference or not, this is an issue which has been raised in the Amendment and in the Committee. The Government knew about it before this morning and we should know the Government's view on the principle of the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend expressed certain fears that London might be dominated by 18-year-old councillors. Many other hon. Members suggested that it was essential that we should build into the Bill some sort of safeguard against that horrific happening. I am not sure why we should need a safeguard, as we talked about reducing the age of majority to 18 in order to give young people something, to give them the vote or the opportunity to marry. I do not think it gives young people anything. It imposes on them additional burdens and responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we say that we need safeguards, I should think the first safeguard is the fact that very few young people will bother to stand for local authorities. I think it is true to say that to the vast majority of young people local government seems to be very much parish pump politics. I say this as a warning to us when we deal with the later Clauses in the Bill, that if we make a hash of allocating functions and leave any branch of local government without any worthwhile job to perform, even fewer young people will be interested in it, and there will be no need to worry whether the Amendment was carried or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second safeguard is the fact that the majority of candidates for local authorities will be selected and endorsed by political parties or by so-called non-political parties, who will know something about them and who will be the best people to judge whether a person would make a suitable councillor, whether the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1418</span>
person be 18, 19, 80 or 90. Even a genuine independent candidate would have to find a proposer, seconder and eight assenters who would know what sort of person the young man or young lady was. Above all, the greatest safeguard is the democratic safeguard. It is not up to a person whether he become a councillor. He must have the right personality, the right knowledge and the right ability to earn and achieve the support of a large proportion of the electorate. If he does not have that, he does not become a councillor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst I have no objection to a Speaker's Conference being held, I think that Conference should restrict itself to the parliamentary aspect of the case, as my hon. Friend said. I hope that the Amendment will not be withdrawn. I hope it will be supported by both sides of the Committee, because it is when both sides of the Committee act on a non-party political line that I suspect we get the best of things. I hope, therefore, that the Amendment will be carried, thus ensuring that so far as local government is concerned young men and young women of 18 will have the right to stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fergus Montgomery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Committee is going in circles. I do not think there is any great disagreement on either side on this aspect. I have to admit that my morning was made when I heard the speech of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) when he said that when he was young he was told that wisdom comes with grey hair. I hope, therefore, that he will sit with bated breath whilst I make my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that he was unduly cynical about the speech of my hon. Friend the Minister of State, when he suggested a Speaker's Conference to look at this whole situation. I think it is right that the Amendment could have wider implications and I think that we should consider, along with the right age for candidates for local government, the question of the age for parliamentary candidates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) when he talked about allowing people to stand for, election to certain councils at the age of 18, but not on other councils. This would perhaps create further anomalies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1947, when I was doing my National
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0771">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1419</span>
Service, I went home and we had a by-election in the Jarrow constituency. I was very annoyed because at that time we had disastrous Labour government and I wanted to vote against it. Whilst I was old enough to fight for my country I was not entitled to vote at that by-election. All of that has been altered now—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It did not make much difference!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Montgomery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Mr. Armstrong) said that it did not make much difference, but if he bothers to check the figures he will find that the result of that by-election showed a very considerable swing, even in Jarrow, against the Labour Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That state of affairs has been altered and, as most hon. Members have said it is true to say that to allow people the right to vote in these elections, but not allow them to be candidates, is not logical. It is also true that it ultimately depends upon the electorate. They are the people who decide whether candidates who offer themselves for election are suitable representatives or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East, I also went on my council when I was 22. I served for eight or nine years, but alas! I never became chairman because the Socialist Hebburn Urban District Council could not possiby ever have had a Tory as their chairman. With singular fair-mindedness, they always insisted on working their own rota system, which excluded anybody of any different political persuasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall not get too embroiled on this matter. When I began speaking I said, I think that there is a sense of agreement on both sides of the Committee. I should have thought that the fairest way was to have agreed with what the Minister of State has suggested, that this whole matter should be referred to the Speaker's Conference, so that all hon. Members, not just members of the Committee can have their views aired, with all the wider implications of what is involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The surprising thing is that when something is not required to be done at a particular time, we call upon all logic. The word has been
	<span class='label label-info column'>1420</span>
repeated time and again when in the real world the development of the human personality and the involvement of the human personality in society does not necessarily follow logic at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we must realise what we are about. I respect the Speaker's Conference. In a Committee of this kind it would be quite wrong to suggest otherwise. I do not want to inhibit the work of a Speaker's Conference, and I shall go so far as to say that on constitutional matters this is the best kind of conference that one could have for a variety of views and experience. That is not the point of the Standing Committee at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to call upon all logic—the Minister of State has done so and one or two hon. Members have emulated the notion, albeit to suggest that there is not much difference between us—it is not illogical to say to a young person that he can elect a Member of Parliament, he can have the judgment to decide the form and shape of Parliament, he can elect local councillors, but he cannot himself be a candidate? That is not logical. I was on the Standing Committee when we achieved the age of majority for the 18-year-olds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the position in this Standing Committee? I charge the Committee that it is dodging its responsibility by using the notion of a Speaker's Conference. I repeat that I respect the Speaker's Conference, but let us examine the situation of an 18-year-old, or any young person. One cannot have a test based on age itself to judge the ability and the qualification of a person to represent society in any of its political institutions. We had the youngest Prime Minister, whom I understand was no fool, at 21, the Younger Pitt—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy with the line being pursued by the hon. Member, but perhaps he could help the Committee by telling the depth to which he would go. Is 18 the sea bottom? Would he go below 18 when he says age is no indication?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson) has misunderstood. I said, "age itself". Age by itself is not the only criterion. I was about to pursue the idea that here, as an example, the Younger Pitt at 21, was in the House of Commons before that age. I believe Sir Charles Knox
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0772">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1421</span>
was another, and there are many examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the converse of the argument. There are many people in public life—I shall make no suggestions about this House because we are concerned with local government—who have served in local government and who presumably have a great deal of experience and knowledge to apply to the affairs of local government. I ask the Committee to bear this in mind. There are also many people in local government with many years' experience; but it is one year's experience multiplied by the number of years they have been in local government. They have not done a single thing after the first year. Therefore, it is wrong to presume that that right, then he makes a judgment. If the age of 21, automatically, because of this element of experience, whether it was stultified after the first year or not, that is a sufficient argument to say that other people below that age of 21 should not come into public life, especially when the same people say that such young people can vote for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it for granted that if a young person can vote for me to come into this House, and this Parliament has decided that right, hen he makes a judgment. If he can make such a judgment affecting the constitution of this House, I want to know how, in logic, one can deny him the right to be a candidate. I repeat that we are dodging the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of examples that I might quote here—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument carefully. Is he making a differentiation between local authorities and Parliament, or, if I follow his argument correctly, is he saying that a candidate should be able to sit for Parliament as well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not fall into that simple trap. It is far too elementary for me to pursue. I shall go so far as to say that the Minister of State's supposition, and one of his reasons for going to the Speaker's Conference, was that if we agree at this stage in respect of local government, this will create a precedent which will involve a parliamentary situation. That was why he was able to qualify his suggestion that this Committee should not deal with this now, but that it should go to a Speaker's Conference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1422</span>
I am saying that they are separate. It does not follow in all logic, as the Minister of State has repeatedly said, that if a man is allowed to serve a local authority, automatically in all logic he should come to Parliament. It is quite impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder what the Young Conservatives would think of the Minister's point of view. I only have the word of the Conservative Party for it, but I understand that the Young Conservatives are a vital, energetic, imaginative number of young people who produce some excellent and responsible reports for the Conservative headquarters to consider. Are you going to say to your Young Conservatives that they are not fit to serve in local government or that they are too young?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not inquire what I am going to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that you would not make such a suggestion, and I withdraw the word "you".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David James</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman realise that the Young Conservatives can be Young Conservatives up to the age of 35?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to those who are below the age of 21. Are we going to ask the Young Socialists—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You cannot say anything to the Young Socialists!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a perfect example of the sort of case when my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) should have credited my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East (Mr. Barry Jones)—who is a much younger Member—with the foresight to anticipate the point that I was coming to. I was about to ask, "Will we say such a thing to the Young Socialists?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that we consider the point with a degree of responsibility, in the light of the remarkable and exciting development of the younger generation. Many examples of the creativeness, ability, ingenuity and sparkling challenge of young people are to be found in literature, science, the Arts and the Humanities. The suggestion that young people cannot serve on a local authority and make a vital and challenging contribution—that we should deprive them of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0773">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1423</span>
that opportunity by calling in constitutional arguments to qualify the matter's being sent to a Speaker's Conference—should be a matter of concern to a Committee charged with dealing with the reorganisation of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reorganisation of local government means that the House has told the Standing Committee, "You are capable of understanding what you are studying". Are we to accept from the Minister of State or anybody else that after 25 Sittings of this Committee there is an experience outside the House which is different from our experience; that we cannot make a judgment about who should sit on local councils, but can make judgments about all the complications and complexities of their reorganisation? I cannot accept that.

We should press the Amendment. If there is no real division on the principle—which then means a free vote—and the Amendment is accepted, let the Government, on Report, put forward sound constitutional reasons showing why we were so stupid. We sometimes make heavy weather of these matters—referring them back to Report, or taking them to Speaker's Conferences—either because we feel that the time is not ripe to come to a decision or because we do not want to grasp the nettle. In local government we will find a principle that we must cherish as much as we can, as long as we believe in the liberties and freedom of our institutions. That principle is that Representation of the People Acts have always laid down a very limited and general area of disqualification—because of corruption, lunacy, or residential or other matters. It has always been limited. The real principle has been that whatever a man's abilities, education and background, as long as he is a British subject he is qualified to stand for Parliament and for local government. It is important to enhance this freedom, which is of paramount importance.

We have in our institutions men who are incompetent, whose judgment is blunted, and who do not know one thing from another. We would add to the qualities of public life by bringing in younger people. They would be refreshingly challenging to the institutions. They would not be inhibited. They would be on the threshold of experience. Surely society is big enough to take in people
	<span class='label label-info column'>1424</span>
to whom we have given the right of the age of majority in order that they can have an involvement in public life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these and many other reasons I urge the Minister not to allow the constitutional problems—which he has not fully described—to interfere in a situation that we can handle without any difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I would sooner work on a mechanistic plane.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the Minister. In my absence, I gather that he made an erudite speech about the Speaker's Conference. I did not hear him, but I had the pleasure and honour of hearing my mining colleague, the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain).

	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I used the word "apposite" purely in a metaphorical context. The search for good candidates in local government, as in the national field, is becoming harder as years go by. I believe that the Young Tories go up to the age of 35, but that is a very immature movement. They need to have older heads, but purely in a chronological sense. I return to the analogy of coalmining. If we pass the Amendment, we shall tap not merely a new seam—not a geological but a political seam—but many new fields. It is not only on the qualita-

tive or, indeed, the moralistic tone that I pursue this matter; I am concerned with quantity. If there are many more voters between the ages of 18 and 21 there are also many more potential candidates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can only speak for my own side. Some old fogeys like the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East and myself, who can look back over the decades, if I may use that term, realise that today it is more and more difficult to find good young candidates, because with nationalisation there are many more opportunities in the public sector, particularly in the Coal Boards, Gas Boards and the like, and in the municipal field also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not my hon. Friend agree that at this moment there appear to be more opportunities to serve in Social Security committees than on the National Coal Board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That needs a lot of deep thought. I feel that if I went into the deeper seams of that one I might be out of order. I accept all that is implicit in what my hon. Friend said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend not agree that it is a sign of growing old that we feel that there are not as many good young councillors now as there were? My experience throughout the country is that there are a number of young people serving on councils who are certainly as good as, and maybe better, than when some of us were young.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With my usual charity I feel that I could make a better case even than my hon. Friend has done. I would say that there are in this seam—18 to 21—even more in numbers and in quality of potential candidates. This is why I am supporting the Amendment. I do not wish to bore the Committee by speaking of educational facilities, pocket money, the mobility of the car and many other things which make it possible for younger people to have wider participation in social, economic and political life, though such things make them better qualified than their forebears and forefathers, like the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East and myself many years ago, who were less footloose than people are today
	<span class='label label-info column'>1426</span>
and had less chance of getting away from our coalfields and into the larger conurbations like the Hartlepools, for example, and sharing in the exotic life of larger communities. In the past we were kept in our villages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that apart, there is no doubt whatever that today we have a fine seam of young people. Whether we have a Speaker's Conference or not, whether we go more deeply into this than the debate this morning, I beg of the Minister, whoever are his advisers, in this field—if I may go back into coalmining—that he obtains some good geophysicists, that he goes deep, that he goes below the surface, that he goes above a few sociological comments from people who may sit in his office. Whatever happens, he must be sure in his own mind, whatever decision he comes to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side of the Committee are perfectly convinced already. We do not need further convincing. We believe from our experience in local government—and many of us have served in those areas—from our political experience and our local parties, and from our experience in our youth movements—we have served in those too—that there is a wonderful new field of fine young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I almost lapsed and spoke of the Pearce Commission going to find out opinion in a certain continent. Some of us do not need these commissions to tell us what the situation is. Nevertheless, if the Minister persists in his attitude, and if he does have further talks and a Speaker's Conference, I hope he will in no way skimp getting evidence in all walks of life. This is vital because I believe in giving them the vote; I believe that we shall have an accession of fine young people coming forward to fill the places of those of us who may have gone by the time the Speaker's Conference makes a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment. I promise to be brief. I believe I heard hon. Members mention my age as 26. Since I have a son aged 13, I should like for the record to say that I am in my early thirties. I have the habit of asking my son to read these Committee papers—[
	<i>Laughter</i>]. I certainly am in favour of vital young councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speaking strictly to the debate, however, I heard the Minister of State mention logic, and he urges us, as very often
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0775">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1427</span>
do his ministerial colleagues in the Committee, to get through the Bill in the interests of logic; yet today his argument has been quite the opposite, that one should be illogical in this particular instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things which worry me is that mention has been made of Speaker's Conference. I should like to know whether the Minister can tell us what the timetabling for the Speaker's Conference will be. If the Conference is after the Third Reading, it is not a very hopeful suggestion. I recollect speaking fairly strongly about the City of London, of all the illogical things which have been advocated in the Committee where this Bill is concerned. The retention of the City of London apparatus is the most illogical of all. It does not help very much to have such arguments put before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) indicated the events which led up to the Lacey Commission. He mentioned early marriage, the ability to become a National Serviceman and to fight a country's war, to make wills, to buy land and to undertake mortgages. Thus the logic surely was that at 18 one could at the very least become a parish councillor. There is no doubt in my mind that there is one great defect in the sociology of at least my constituency. I am thinking of the huge estates, the relatively cheap housing, semi-detached estates, where there are thousands of young married people setting up home and starting out on their married lives. These estates seem to be populated almost entirely by the 18 to 25 year-olds. I should have thought it would be an excellent idea, which the Government could accept, that from 18 years of age one could have councillors from such estates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt in my mind that young people of 18 and 20 today are very far from the apron strings of their mothers or of society. The decent education which we now give young people, the relatively fat wage packets, the early marriage, the general happiness and rude good health are all qualifications towards being a councillor at the age of 18. Students can organise huge student unions at the age of 18, 19 or 21; young people can, as they often do, help organise church and chapel, give sermons and con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1428</span>
duct Sunday School, and it is a fact that the 18 year-old is often at the vanguard of our political parties. They give it the muscle, the idealism and often the working parts. That is the case in many constituencies. Therefore I do not see how or why they should be denied this right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any of us who goes to a sixth form college in our constituencies, or to the local technical college, and talks or listens to the groups of young people, will know that they are eminently qualified to give a very reasonable and sound contribution to public life. Without being too sentimental, if the young soldier today can bear the harassment of sentry duty in Ulster, or if a young person can be a miner and endure the cold in the bowels of the earth at the age of 18, I should have thought it was established beyond all doubt that today, with our educational system and all the available opportunities in our society, such people could he councillors at the age of 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can, anyway, only look at the opposite as it now exists. What does age so often do in the hierarchies of our local authorities? It is often just a series in a history of enmity and prejudice and it is sometimes self-seeking. Parts of our local government system are now worthy of a calculated breath of fresh air. I think that youngsters, such as those on whose behalf we on this side of the Committee are arguing, could do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might end this awful dead hand on local government of "Buggins' turn", the thing that so often prevents the best ideas from flowering. I will leave my remarks at that, but I think that such a debate and such a decision has a wider significance than that simply in a Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know there is no need to persuade the Minister of the logic of giving the vote to 18 year olds. Perhaps we have overstressed that particular part of our argument. I want to deal with the helpful and generous concession made by the Minister about not pronouncing on the Amendment but saying that it should be referred to the Speaker's Conference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned here with the Local Government Bill. We are discussing it constructively, not because we like the Bill but because local government is in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0776">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1429</span>
so much need of reform. Those who work in the local government service have been messed about for so many years that we must try to improve what is basically a bad Bill. This is the purpose of these discussions. If this matter went to the Speaker's Conference, the Local Government Bill would go on to the Statute Book with this illogical provision that young people can vote at the age of 18, but cannot stand for the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Speaker's Conference will have to consider parliamentary as well as local government participation. In my opinion, these are not the same. There is logic and a practical advantage in deciding now whether youngsters aged 18 ought to stand for the local authority. We cannot say that, if we decide this, we are automatically saying that they ought to be able to stand for Parliament. I would probably take the view that young folk who vote at the age of 18 ought to be able to be candidates for Parliament, but I do not think I have to pronounce or make up my mind about participation in a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole idea of local government reform is to increase public understanding and participation in local government. I do not personally think that young people bring a breath of fresh air or that they are more revolutionary than older people. One cannot generalise in that way. I know people 60 and 70 years old, who are revolutionary and radical. They bring a breath of fresh air. I know people in their twenties who are dead as dodos, who would not revolutionise or bring any radical spirit anywhere. I think we are wrong to try to put people in compartments in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Young people—not those in universities or in Sixth Form colleges—they can express themselves—but those who, having left school far too early, spend most of their time at work but have an experience and a concept of the quality of life that needs to be expressed in our local councils, ought to be involved in local government, and anything which would involve them is, in my opinion, worth while. They will not flood the councils. I wish that this local government reform which is now going through would mean that all these people will clamour to serve on the local council, but I do not believe it. We will still have to persuade people that it is their duty
	<span class='label label-info column'>1430</span>
to give some public service by serving on local councils. I say to the Minister that it is our duty to make a pronouncement on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Speaker's Conference will have the duty of surveying a wider field. I want to impress upon the Minister that the two are not the same. This is something quite separate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced by my own experience that service in local government is a first-class training for wider public service. Had I come to this House when I first contested a parliamentary election, I should not have been as good a Member as I was after eight years in local government. The Bill would not have been such a mess had more ministers had the valuable experience of being in local government. We can read as much as we like, be interested in public service, have the right kind of approach and attitude, but experience is also a great teacher. Those who have served the public through parish councils, rural district councils, urban district councils, county boroughs and so on come to the House with experience which is helpful in the duties that fall upon them as parliamentarians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parliamentary election is normally five years. In local elections, where there would be few 18 year olds but some 19 year olds, they would serve for three years and they would do so only if the democratic process decided that they were fit to serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is that there are those who in their teens become very excited about local affairs and world affairs; and this is right. It is better that they are able to come to a local authority while they have some responsibility. The worst thing that can happen is that they can make these pronouncements knowing that they have no responsibility. They can denounce everything—this is part of today's pattern. Once you give young people responsibility, they tend to mature very early. This happens in all organisations and particularly in political parties. When one has a rebel, one who wants to tear down everything, one gives him a job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know many people who thought they could put the world right overnight. They were given responsibility. It is far easier to speak when in opposition than oh the Government Front Bench. We all realise this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0777">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1431</span>
It is good to tell young folk that we believe that they can do all these responsible things at the age of 18. It is. not only logical; it is good sense to tell them at the same, time that they must accept their responsibilities. All the rights that they talk about involve some responsibility. Therefore, young men and women who want to put the world or the local scene right should be allowed to stand the test of the democratic process. If they do and are successful, it will be to the advantage rather than to the disadvantage of local government. I support the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Reed</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If William Pitt could be Prime Minister of this country at the age of 21, if Alexander could rule half the known world at the age of 18. if Chesterton could write some of his finest poems before he was 17, and if Mozart could compose some very fine music before he was 16, it is not unreasonable that we should allow people to stand to serve on a local council at the age of 18. We are not deciding whether somebody should serve on that local council; we are deciding whether we should give the opportunity to the electors to decide whether an 18-year-old should be entitled to be their representative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refuse to believe that the wisdom here or at the Speaker's Conference is any greater than the wisdom of the electors in an individual ward. The electors are choosing whether a certain man is the right person to be their representative. I support the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Mr. Armstrong) was very fair. He said that I had not attempted to argue against the principle of the Amendment. I have very carefully avoided doing so. I have tried to put before the Committee the wider implications, which I believe are inevitable if we accept the Amendment. We have talked a great deal about logic. I believe that, in logic, the consequence of accepting the Amendment is almost certain to be that we have to consider a reduction in the age of candidature in a parliamentary context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment, and the arguments on both sides in relation to it, derive from the precedent set by Parliament in establishing the right to vote at 18. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>1432</span>
Committee will recall that that matter was considered by a Speaker's Conference. I think I am right in saying that every other major constitutional change of that kind has first been considered by a Speaker's Conference, which can hear the evidence, go into the question in depth, and consider the wider implications which may arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of votes at 18 was considered by a Speaker's Conference. That conference recommended that there should be a right to vote at 20. The House of Commons, on a free vote on the Conservative side, decided that the age should be reduced to 18. I voted in favour of the reduction to 18 in that Division. In making that decision Parliament had full knowledge of the evidence presented and. the recommendations made to the Speaker's Conference. Parliament made its decision in the light of the wider discussion which had taken place in the Speaker's Conference which preceded that decision. I believe that it is right for the same precedent to be followed in considering what may well be a fundamental constitutional proposal, and one which inevitably follows from the proposal made in this Committee in respect of the right to stand for local authorities at 18.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not want a decision to be taken this morning on the basis of a misconception, and I should be misleading the Committee if I were to say that I could in any way guarantee or indicate that a Speaker's Conference would reach a decision in time for an Amendment to be incorporated into the Bill at a later stage. The right way to make a change of this kind, once it was decided upon, would be as was done in 1969 by the previous Government. It was done by a Representation of the People Bill. Such a Bill could take into account both the question of the right to stand for both Parliament and a local authority.

He urged us to go deeply into this question. I can assure him that this is a matter that one considers deeply, and one that will be decided in the end by Parliament. The Government will have their views, as will Ministers. All the implications, and all the points brought out in a very constructive and useful debate this morning, will be considered. My advice to the Committee must be the same—that in the light of the decision to set up a Speaker's Conference I do not believe that it would be right to accept the Amendment this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In winding up for this side of the Committee, let me say that I respect the views of the Minister of State, Home Office, and the way in which he has put his argument. If I differ from him it is the difference of two people who, I imagine, on this issue are not so far apart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman very properly began by talking about misconceptions. It is therefore right that in winding up I should mention certain misconceptions that have been present in a number of speeches this morning. I do so quite frankly, as I intend to ask my hon. Friends to press for a Division on the Amendment. I hoped that I might carry the hon. Member for Dorset, North (Mr. David James) with me. I hope that the hon. Member for Merton and Morden (Miss Fookes) will be in that gallant company, too. I must therefore very clearly deal with what I believe to be various misconceptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, as the hon. Lady and also my hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West (Mr. Armstrong)—in a very moving speech—said, this is not really a youth or age question. Some of my best friends are old fogeys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second misconception is that of the hon. Member for Brierley Hill (Mr. Montgomery). It is not the same thing to believe that votes should be given at 18 as to turn it into a question for a Speaker's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0779">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1435</span>
Conference. Indeed, in terms of this Bill, by putting the matter to the Speaker's Conference we should be delaying it beyond the period of the next local government elections. One must vote realising the effect of this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole purpose of sending the matter to a Speaker's Conference is for the Conference to examine it in the context of Parliament—and that is a totally different matter. Probably the Minister of State, Home Office, and I would be in entire agreement that it would not be a catastrophe if people could stand for Parliament at 18. I said earlier—the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) agreed with me—that it is possible to have different ages. The effect of transmitting this question to the Speaker's Conference is to rule it out for local government matters for the next election and possibly for some time afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other misconception that struck me was that of the hon. Member for Cannock. This I attribute to a quite reasonable view on' his part—the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) also had this reasonable view—that the Speaker's Conference is rather like the word of God. It is in no wise the word of God. Sometimes, unlike the word of God, it is fallible. The Minister of State, Home Office, rather gave the game away. He pointed out in a throw-away line that on the occasion of deciding the issue of votes at 18, the Speaker's Conference, with monumental wisdom, decided that we ought to lower the voting age from 21. We could not lower it to 18, so we lowered it to 20, and the House of Commons …</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

exactly the same position in this Committee. Indeed, the hon. Member for Cannock said that we number only 45: 45, with pairs, subject to the usual channels, no doubt. We are actually a Committee of 50, and there were 30 members of the last Speaker's Conference. Those 30 might well have been taken from this Committee—so why is the conference so ripe in maturity? There is nothing in that point at all; indeed I cannot imagine, looking round, a more representative Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, we have been charged to deal with the qualifications and disqualifications for local government, and we cannot burk that responsibility. We must express an opinion on it, since the matter has been raised. We cannot absolve ourselves by letting somebody else consider it in a totally different context, as the Minister of State, Home Office suggested, in talking about the precedents. He said that Governments always implement the recommendations of the Speaker's Conference. It may have been a slip of the tongue. I intervened at that point to say "Quite wrong". They did not do so on the last occasion, as he well knows; they introduced a different recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must make up its mind in the light of local government; that is what we are charged to do. It may well be that there is a different answer in terms of parliamentary considerations. When the Minister of State talks about every constitutional change having been referred to the Speaker's Conference he is again thinking in terms of parliamentary situations and not in terms of local government. I cannot remember an occasion when a local government consideration was put to a Speaker's Conference. Perhaps the Minister of State has one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, but I cannot understand his seeming impatience. He is a very reasonable man, and yet several times during our deliberations he has said that we should come back to this on Report; that we should not take a decision today, but mull over it. Why this impatience on this specific issue—possibly the most important we have discussed this morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The impatience results from a feeling of frustration that I have had ever since 1969 about the total illogicality of telling young people that they may vote at 18 but cannot stand as councillors at that age. This is the obvious opportunity to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since my hon. Friend has taxed the Minister with his ignorance in the past about Speaker's Conferences and such matters, I need some guidance. When the age came down to 21 in local government, who settled the issue? Possibly it was 25 in the 1900s; I do not know. It is possible to have some help here. When did it come down to 21?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather sticking my neck out, but I am pretty certain that it did not come as a result of a Speaker's Conference—and also that it came negatively, in that when local government areas and boundaries were made statutory a qualification of 21 was put in. I think that that was what happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may pursue my train of thought before it goes entirely off the rails, or starts delivering coals to Newcastle—I was pointing out that there are two different forms of consequence. The Minister of State is a little muddled on them. He says that the consequence of our voting today for young people of 18 to stand as councillors is that we will be usurping the right of the Speaker's Conference or, later, of Parliament, to decide that people of 18 should not stand for Parliament. This is not so. All that we shall do is to force Parliament to consider whether people of 18 should stand for Parliament. We are not in any</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>I hope that the hon. Member for Dorset, North will take this fully into account in voting for the Amendment. He is not voting against the idea of a Speaker's Conference. I agree with the Minister of State, Home Office, on this. A Speaker's Conference is absolutely right, but it ought to be a Speaker's Conference which sticks to its last—and its last is the question whether people of 18 should stand for the House of Commons and not for local government.</p>

	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>Finally, the hon. Member for Merton and Morden (Miss Fookes) looks for some kind of peace treaty. That is understandable, because this is really a fratricidal non-party war that we have on this point. She asks whether it is not possible to reach a compromise on this. I offer her this compromise. Let us vote for the Amendment. Let us see that 18-year-olds are in a position to stand—not necessarily to be successful—for local elections. Let us say to the Minister of State, as I do willingly, "Let the Speaker's Conference decide the wider implications, as to Parliament itself". It is very important that they should.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we can take Amendment No. 785, in page 50, line 38, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>() All qualifications referred to in subsection (1) above shall continue for the whole period of office. If a councillor's qualifications cease'during his period of office, his office shall be declared vacant in accordance with section 87 of this Act.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In considering Amendment No. 782 it is right that Amendment No. 785 should also be considered, because they read together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the two Amendments is to bring this Clause back to the position under Section 57 of the Local Government Act, 1933. Under the 1933 Act a person not only had to be qualified to be elected, but had to be qualified to continue as a member of the authority. In other words, if a person's only qualification was that of being an elector for the area, he had to continue to be registered as an elector throughout his term of office. If he were to leave the area, he would cease to be a councillor as soon as the new register was published on which his name no longer appeared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the Amendment we are trying to preserve that situation. The effect of the addition of the words "on that day" is that, provided that on that day somebody has fulfilled the qualification of being an elector, even if he were to cease to be thereafter, he could continue to represent the area of his authority for the rest of the term of that council. We regard that as undesirable; nor do we think that that can be what the Government intend. After all, it could mean that a person who moved away from the area, no longer having any connection with it, and being possibly 400 miles away, could continue to be a councillor as long as he put in his six-monthly appearance. He would have to make one appearance at a sub-committee, one every six months, and that would be sufficient. There is no case whatever for a breach of the 1933 principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand. I should like to look at this. I think there are certain reasons why a person should cease to be a member, particularly if he moves abroad or ceases to be a British subject. I should like to consider the implications of what the right hon. Gentleman has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are difficulties about having by-elections. Also, one needs to consider carefully what is actually meant by a person moving away and how long he has to be away before he loses his qualifications. I shall consider the right hon. Gentleman's point, which is a narrow one. I had not appreciated that he would raise it separately. If an Amendment is tabled on Report, I shall give the result of my thoughts on it then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) takes up the Minister's point, may I say that I consider this an important point, not a narrow one. It is a point that is crystal clear. The Bill introduces the concept that if a person on the relevant date—that is, the day of his nomination—is a local government elector of an area or owns land and has held it for 12 months within that area, on that relevant date he can be elected and continue to be a member of the local authority for the whole four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is palpable nonsense in a local government context, where there should be local government councillors who live or at least belong to—we disagree on either side of the Committee on the meaning of the words "belong to"—or at least have connections with an area. At the moment a person could be registered, even at an accommodation address, and be a local government elector for an area at the day of his nomination. Then, even before he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0782">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1441</span>
was elected to the council, he could move to an area 200 miles away and the electors would be stuck with him for four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be true that most councillors, of either political party, finding that they have to move from an area—and this is increasingly common in this more mobile age when people's jobs move about quite a lot—being honourable and reasonable men, resign from the local authorities concerned. There is either a by-election or they may resign at a time sufficiently convenient for the election to take place during the normal May elections. Either way, it is quite reasonable. The Bill says—and says for the first time—that a person can remain for four years as a member of that council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that the Minister, in reply to my right hon. Friend, would give the reason why the Government have changed the existing law. There is a change in the existing law. It is not something carried over from the 1933 Act whereby a person, if he had resided for 12 months within the area, could remain on the council—that is fair—but beyond that he should go, if local government is to have any context as local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both sides of the Committee would agree that leaving it as it is could leave the matter open to abuse. It is the duty of the Committee to prevent abuses of the system of local government. This is, surely, not a matter on which the Minister has to consider or to take up on Report. If this is an error in the drafting of the Bill, it is our duty as a Committee to put that error right. If it is not an error in the Bill and it is the Government's intention and policy to make a substantial change in the law, then the Committee is entitled to know the reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I follow my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) in registering my protest against a singularly opaque answer by the Minister to my right hon. Friend's point. As my hon. Friend and right hon. Friend said, this is a departure from the 1933 Act. The Minister is trying to persuade the Committee that the drafters of the Bill have introduced a wholly new concept into the Bill without considering its effect, so that when the illogicality is pointed out, they have to reconsider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that parliamentary
	<span class='label label-info column'>1442</span>
draftsmen work in such a haphazard way. If the Minister brings to the Committee a measure of which he seeks our approval, it is' his job to justify the action taken by the drafters of the Bill. Consideration must have been given to this. Therefore, there must be an answer readily available to the Minister. The Minister need not try to fob us off by saying that in the dim and distant future he will have another think about this. He should have thought about it already!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes. What we are considering is not whether we fill council places, but the quality of representation given by the people on those councils. If we allow occasional visitors to annual or semi-annual functions to keep their place, although they no longer have any connection with or interest in the district, we should do a disservice to local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Montgomery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to speak in support of what hon. Gentlemen opposite have said on this issue. There are great dangers unless something is done. Local government should be local as far as possible. When I served on my local council, perhaps I made it too local in that I happened to live in the centre of the ward that I represented. I felt that this was invaluable because it meant that any of the electors of the ward could contact me very easily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have got the wrong end of the stick, but I understand that, as the law is today, if a councillor does not attend any meetings for six months without good reason he is automatically disqualified from the council. It is possible for councillors not to attend for six months due to very serious illness. Nobody would like to see people who have given great service to a council, who have a serious illness, who are recovering and who will return to contribute to that council, being dismissed, and therefore there are extenuating circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman. We are not here discussing the disqualification of a councillor who fails to attend for a period of six months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Montgomery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was using it only as an analogy. According to the Amendment that we are discussing, somebody could be elected to serve on a council; he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0783">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1443</span>
need not appear at that council for four years, but can go on holding his seat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, he could not, because he would be caught under the provision whereby he had not turned up for six months. This Amendment prevents a man being a local government elector on the relevant day—that is nomination day—putting in a spasmodic appearance once every six months, but living for four years 200 or 300 miles away from the place he represents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Montgomery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) and I accept what he says. We had a case in one of the papers during the last few days, of somebody who was elected to serve on a council, and who has now moved over 200 miles away. This is a ridiculous situation, because how can the people whom he serves take any of their local problems to a man who lives so far away and, as a consequence, is not able to attend meetings of the council? I hope my hon. Friend will look very seriously at this question, because I am certainly prepared to vote with the Opposition unless I have an assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have quite a lot of sympathy with the broad principle put forward by the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin). I think that somebody who moves far away out of the area is not in a position to represent on a local authority the interests of the people whom he purports to represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Committee to understand the technical complications. The Amendment as drafted would not be acceptable. The Amendment as drafted would mean that if someone inadvertently were left off the electoral roll he would have to resign his seat on the council. That I do not think would be acceptable. In principle, there is a point where one tries to strike a balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is difficult to say that a person serving on a council, who moves his house perhaps a quarter of a mile over the border, should have to resign on those grounds. That is the effect of the Amendment. That is the reason I could not accept it as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has been the effect of the law for the past 39 years. Why suddenly does the Minister want to move it so far the other way that it becomes a nonsense?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My advice is that this is a restatement of the existing law. If I am wrong, certainly I shall consider this on Report. Where a person moves away and is not able to do his job properly, he should not continue to represent people on the local authority. For technical reasons I am not able to accept the Amendment. I should like to look at the wider implications of this proposal and I shall consider whether the substance of the right hon. Gentleman's point can be met on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I keep talking for a few minutes I might give the Minister a chance to look at it during the luncheon adjournment. On the other hand, I appreciate that to do so on what is now a very narrow point would be something so akin to filibustering that it would hurt both me and you, Sir Stephen. I am afraid I shall have to accept the Minister's assurances, unless by now he has had a look at Section 57 of the 1933 Act. I know the difficulty; I have been in it myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original Sections of the 1933 Act did not have three words; the three words are "on that day". If the Minister looks at this new Clause he will see "on that day" means, as my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) clearly pointed out, the relevant day. The relevant day means the day of nomination. To say that this is merely a restatement of the old Section is quite incorrect; it is not. The addition of those three words has made all the difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Minister of State, Home Office is trying to agree with me that what I regard as wrong is what the hon. Member for Brierley Hill (Mr. Montgomery) regards as wrong, namely that someone can just go right out of the area and continue to represent people, but just not be available. I do not agree with him for once about the wording. I have always said that we are not here to act as draftsmen. Actually I think the wording is rather good in this Clause, but let the Minister take it back to look at it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend sits down, and more importantly before he does anything rash, could he deal with the point that the Minister of State made, which I thought was somewhat disturbing, when he referred to the position of a member of a council who moves about a quarter of a mile over the border? In the previous Bill we had this question of people being able to serve on the council of the local authority in which they work. If the Government are now making a further extension of a three-mile limit, or a five-mile limit, or a 10-mile limit from the boundaries of an area—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend might have intervened on the Minister rather than on me. I would not defend that proposition, and I was about to deal with it. That also is new made law. This is not really the reason why these differentiating words are put into the Bill, because if that were so they would have applied in 1933, just as they apply 39 years later in 1972. It is not suddenly that the Minister remembers that old Bill Smith lives across the stream that is at the end of his constituency, that he has only just moved there and he ought to be allowed to continue as a councillor. Nothing of the sort. This is a matter of inadvertently bad drafting. It is as simple as that, and all of us can see it. While I congratulate the Minister on building
	<span class='label label-info column'>1446</span>
the most remarkable bricks with a total deficiency of straw, the truth of the matter is that he is as puzzled about it as we are.
