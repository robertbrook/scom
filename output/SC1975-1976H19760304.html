	<div class='title'>CONSTITUTION AND GENERAL DUTIES OF THE AGENCY</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed—(2nd March)—</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee rose on Tuesday, Mrs. Jeger, I was within sight of concluding my remarks on the Question of which you have just reminded the Committee. My purpose in those remarks was to emphasise the all-important distinction, so often blurred, between an intention and an objective, which we might—and in this case all do—share, and the appropriateness or otherwise of specific methods proposed to be adopted for the achievement of the objective, and to reiterate what, but for experience, it might seem unnecessary to reiterate—namely, that acceptance of the objective does not bind those who accept it to accept also whatever methods of obtaining it may be proposed, and conversely that no attack, however sharp, which my hon. Friends and I may launch upon the methods proposed in the Bill can fairly or reasonably be taken to imply any divergence or weakness on our part in support of the objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier in my remarks I had ventured to suggest that often representative bodies, and more particularly what I called archetypal representative bodies like the CBI and the TUC, are particularly vulnerable to the temptation to give way to what they believe is the prevailing fashion and therefore, unhappily, add their apparent weight and support to measures which do not commend themselves to their prudence or their experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was saying that on Tuesday, I could hardly have hoped—it was not in
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
my contemplation—that at that very moment perhaps, certainly on that very day, the Secretary of the Northern Ireland Confederation of British Industry and the Secretary of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce were appending their signatures to an official document addressed to my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McClusker), which, in one of its paragraphs that I shall seek the indulgence of the Committee to read, puts so much more aptly the point which I was striving to express and, coming from the source which it does, with so much more authority than I personally could command.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It referred to the statements from the right hon. Gentleman and from the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Chan-non) in the course of the Second Reading, which stated or implied that the contents of the Bill, following the recommendations of the working party report, enjoyed the support of the CBI of Northern Ireland. That you will appreciate, Mrs. Jeger, is support for the principle of proceeding by way of agency which is embodied both in the working party report and in the Bill. It is that subject which, for the first time and as a matter of principle, we are now deciding when deciding whether Clause 1 shall stand part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having referred to those statements, the writers proceed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The CBI/Chamber position has been consistent throughout. We have been sceptical of the efficacy of legislation to deal with the human problems involved in discrimination but accepted its inevitability for a number of reasons, especially that similar legislation had been enacted both in the UK and in a number of other countries; we also supported the objectives of the proposed legislation"</p></blockquote>
—as, indeed, of course do my hon. Friends and myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. J. D. Concannn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since when?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Member inquire since when my hon. Friends and I have been opposed to discrimination between citizens of Northern Ireland on grounds of their religion? He cannot seriously mean that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seem to remember a Second Reading vote that went through the House. If the right hon. Member can explain away a Second Reading vote, I shall be very serious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope, Mrs. Jeger, that you will not hold me to blame for offensive, tedious repetition or for wasting the Committee's time when the fault lies with the Under-Secretary. After all, if the difference between objectives and method is so subtle that the profound mind and the diligent study of the Under-Secretary has still been unable to grasp it, then one must ask hon. Members of the Committee to give a little indulgence to those to whom the distinction is very important. It is the same distinction that is being made in the sentence which I have just quoted from the two official bodies representative of industry and commerce as a whole in Northern Ireland:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have been sceptical of the efficacy of legislation to deal with the human problems involved in discrimination … we also supported the objectives."</p></blockquote>
The objective is to minimise discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat—and I hope that I have conveyed my point now to the Under-Secretary—that that objective of minimising discrimination between citizen and citizen in Northern Ireland on grounds of religious persuasion is one which is wholeheartedly shared by my hon. Friends and myself. Speaking for myself, I challenge anyone here or anywhere else to cite any instance or case where I personally, in any aspect of my public behaviour on this or the other side of the water, have shown any discrimination or distinction whatsoever between persons of different religious persuasion. I am sorry, Mrs. Jeger. I was, I hope venially, tempted into reinforcing the point by the intervention of the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one sentence to add to my quotation, and it is important:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This"—</p></blockquote>
that is the position as there set out of scepticism as to the efficacy of the proposed legislation—
	<br><blockquote><p>"was made clear to the Government at the time and our view was reiterated to Messrs. van Straubenzee and Biggs-Davison on their recent visits to Northern Ireland."</p></blockquote>
It is not my intention in any way to impugn the sincerity, good faith or truthfulness—of course not—of the Minister and his colleagues in the Government, or the two hon. Members cited in the passage which I have just quoted. But what that passage proves is how dangerous it
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
is to put to representative bodies propositions which imply conformity with a trend of fashion, a trend of fashion in legislation, with an apparently irresistible mood of the public to call for Government legislative intervention. It is very easy to be deceived by the absence of a direct repudiation on the Government's part into believing that they, too, really support and agree with the efficacy of the measures that are proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Stanley Orme)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the right hon. Gentleman tell the Committee whether the letter is signed by Lieutenant-Colonel Slater?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is. I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh will place it at the right hon. Gentleman's disposal, as I am sure it was so intended by the signatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the right hon. Gentleman allow me further to point out, as the right hon. Gentleman and other hon. Gentleman know, that Lieutenant-Colonel Slater was a member of the working party which agreed the proposals which are now before the Committee? In my discussions with Jim Slater he has told me quite clearly that the CBI supported the principle of this Bill, but that it had some detailed criticisms, one of which has been outlined by the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Committee net last Tuesday, I have been able to ascertain in Northern Ireland—and I hope to say more when I wind up, Mrs. Jeger, about the current situation and feelings—that that letter does not prove that the CBI is opposed to this Bill, as the right hon. Gentleman is inferring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was, I feel, a helpful intervention because it enables the right hon. Gentleman and me between us to bring out the extreme danger, when Governments are in contact with representative bodies like the CBI, of their underestimating the psychological force which is brought to bear upon those bodies by the authority of government and the general atmosphere of opinion as those bodies take it to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, I go back to what Colonel Slater said. They accepted its inevitability. They said "This measure will go through anyhow, so what is the point of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
standing up, like that fellow Enoch Powell does from time to time, and protesting against something in order to be right 10 years later?" That is not in the letter. If they had been more 
	<i>au fait</i> with the general course and experience of politics, I am sure that comparison would have occurred to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry, Mrs. Jeger. I do not want to give the impression that I do not treat this matter seriously, because in this clause and throughout the Bill we shall be considering whether the methods proposed for obtaining the objective will do more harm than good and will be efficacious in any respect. It is because my hon. Friends and I believe that they will not be efficacious—indeed, that on balance they will increase sensitivity to real or fancied discrimination to religious differences—that we opposed the Bill on Second Reading and we shall vote against this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We find now that our scepticism of the efficacy of any legislation, let alone this measure, is shared by one of the representative bodies which, as the right hon. Gentleman fairly said, took part in the proceedings of the working party bodies, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the CBI, and could fairly be quoted therefore as not merely authorising but actually demanding this sort of legislation, as the hon. Members whom I have mentioned said in the Second Reading debate. So dangerous is it to underestimate the force of authority and the force of fashion—in short, the force of what people suppose is politically inevitable—in distorting and defracting the advice which Governments and Members receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat—for the last time at least in this particular debate—that we shall go astray on this Bill if we constantly confuse objective with method. In considering the Bill, we are required to direct our minds towards method. It is the considered view of my hon. Friends and myself that the establishment of an agency with all the inevitable repercussions, is not merely an inefficacious method, but a method which will prove counter-productive in moving towards the common object which all members of the Committee share.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Airey Neave</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman was certainly right in saying that in most of this debate we should be concerned with methods. But, looking
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
fairly at this clause, we are 95 per cent. concerned with directives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Neave</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is my opinion. The right hon. Gentleman does not agree with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Neave</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Looking fairly at this clause, we are concerned with objects. If we agree with those objects, which the right hon. Gentleman says he does and we, in the Conservative Party do, what is the point of leaving the objectives out of this clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member be good enough to read the clause and say where he finds the statement of objects?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Neave</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regard the objectives described in paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>) of subsection (1)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Neave</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:—as laying duties upon the agency to discharge those objectives. The Conservative Party has made this clear by voting with the Government. In the circumstances, we do not agree with the right hon. Gentleman who said he agreed with the objects, but would seek to improve some of the methods. He said that no divergence or weakness should be inferred from his agreement with the objectives. So I repeat, what is the point of leaving them out of this clause? In those circumstances, we shall support the Government if the Committee is divided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Latham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have found the right hon. Gentleman's remarks more convincing if, over the last few years in which I have taken an interest in Northern Ireland affairs, I had read, heard and seen evidence that the people with whom he is associating these days had strenuously campaigned to eradicate discrimination in employment, as well as in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for him to come here this morning and repeat, in response to the intervention by the Under-Secretary, that we are united in objectives. If there were other ways in which the objectives could be achieved, and if the motivation which is claimed were genuine, we would possibly not be looking at this Bill at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is probably not within the parliamentary convention to make references to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
hypocrisy, so let me draw short of that by saying that if the right hon. Gentleman wants to be taken seriously in such assertions as he has again made this morning, it is incumbent upon him to show that there has been real effort to achieve the objectives to which he, this morning, claims that he and his hon. Friends subscribe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one had a situation in which every one observed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I appreciate the difficulties of the hon. Gentleman, but perhaps he could relate his remarks more closely to Clause 1 of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will do so, Mrs. Jeger. If the Committee is asked to accept that this clause is not necessary to the Bill, in making that claim it must be shown that there are other ways to achieve the objectives, since the argument presented to the Committee is that the Committee is unanimous in wanting to achieve the objectives of the Bill. Therefore, I repeat the challenge to the right hon. Gentleman and his friends, that if they want their remarks to be accepted as having been made in good faith, they should show evidence of recent activities which would confirm their claim to support the objectives of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Dunlop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mrs. Jeger, under your benign, fair and, at times, firm control of the Committee. I hope that I shall not transgress outside the confines of this clause this morning. I might as well say that written large over my notes is the word "agency", which, I think, comes within the confines of this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure, Mrs. Jeger, that you will forgive me if I begin by quoting from the Holy Scriptures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunlop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am going back to the Old Testament, for, as the psalmist states in one of his writings:
	<br><blockquote><p>…while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue".</p></blockquote>
That more or less describes why I am here this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I looked through the preliminary clauses of the Bill and its early sentences, the fire burned to some extent, and now I intend to speak. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…discrimination on the ground of religious belief or political opinion …"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
The object of the Bill is to promote equality of opportunity and eliminate discrimination. It is the brainchild of a Socialist Government. I am glad to see so many Labour Members here today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday it was disheartening to see the empty seats when we were discusing the matter of health and social security in Northern Ireland. There were not many Members on the other side of the Committee to hear or take part in the debate. However, I do not want to say too much about that, or I shall incur the displeasure of the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original war cry of Socialism was "Workers of the world unite". That is how the whole conception was born, and how it spread throughout Russia and to the United Kingdom. But the principles and objective of the Bill, and the methods that will be employed, will lead to the cry "Workers of Ulster divide and if you do not divide, by God, we will make you divide by law". That will be art inevitable result of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question that will be asked of a worker when applying for a job in Northern Ireland when the Bill becomes law will not be "What is your craft?" or "What kind of a tradesman are you? Are you a good joiner, a good engineer, or a good fitter? Are you a good trade unionist?" Instead, it will be "What is your religion?" The natural reaction of any man like myself would be "What the hell business is it of yours? I am here to do a job. Do you want me to act as a tradesman? Do you want something made in this factory? Do you want something created for the prosperity of my country? What does my religion matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is getting dangerously near making a Second Reading speech. I hope that he will confine himself closely to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also remind the Committee that the proceedings this morning are being mechanically recorded, and I hesitate to think what the outcome of the recording will be if there are conversations taking place at the same time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunlop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I submit that the result of the oversight by the Agency will be to ensure that that will be the first question to be asked of any man.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Litterick</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the kind of culture from which the hon. Member comes, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
question that he is asking us to believe will become horrendously explicit never needs to be asked. That is why we are here. I am astonished that the hon. Gentleman does not realise that. Everybody always knows the answer to the question. It is never asked because everybody knows that it is a dangerous question to ask explicitly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot find the proper parliamentary substitute for that impermissible word. It is, to say the least, humbug for someone who has spent all his life in that culture to try to persuade the Committee that it will be divisive to set up an agency which will try to contain some of the more barbarous behaviour of people in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is rather a long intervention. The hon. Gentleman may catch my eye later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunlop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have lived all of my life in Northern Ireland, and most of it as a worker. I have said time and again both in the House and in Committee that I am the son of a worker and I am a trade unionist. I know what it is like to work alongside others. For years I worked alongside Roman Catholics and, indeed, atheists, in the service of a large multiple grocery firm. When I reached the position of branch manager I was not concerned with what religion a man practised but whether he was doing his job properly. That is the fundamental point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the message and the objective in the Bill, and the oversight that will be exercised by the Agency, will exacerbate the situation in Northern Ireland. It will define more clearly the division which we are trying to heal in Northern Ireland. To give a man a job on the strength of his political opinion is a denial of democracy and Socialism. It is possible that I, although speaking from this side of the Committee on behalf of the people of Ulster, know more about Socialism than a good many hon. Members sitting on the Government side. (
	<i>Interruption.</i>)</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is nothing about Socialism in the clause. I must ask the hon. Gentleman to relate his remarks more to the clause. I also remind the Committee that sedentary interruptions are not permissible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunlop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most of what I was going to say about political opinion and religious
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
belief has been interrupted. Therefore, I shall not be much longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the operation of this agency and, indeed, the principle behind the Bill, will be good for Northern Ireland from the point of view of employment and workers. Fundamentally, it will hit the worker. The man working on the shopfloor is more important than a crowd of trade union officials sitting around a table. The trade unionist I am talking about is the man on the shopfloor, the man who is working with his fellow workers and who is using his skill to promote the ultimate good of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently I had a letter from the right hon. Gentleman and a news-sheet from his Department of Commerce, containing another depressing piece of news about the town of Strabane. I wish hon. Members could see that town.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is nothing about that town in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mrs. Jeger.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it is in order to quote from the 
	<i>Hansard</i> report of our last Sitting. The hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) was called to order sometimes, but most of his remarks were in the context of the clause. However, he did refer to some of the factors that gave rise to the need for the Bill and the Agency. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I refer to the famous controversy which raged over many years in Northern Ireland,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
and to which there was no conclusion, concerning Rolls-Royce".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Standing Committee H,</i> 2nd March 1976; c. 41.]</p></blockquote>
He described how workers arrived in a minibus at Rolls-Royce factory and were fired on by a machine gun when they got out, the object being to scare them away because they were Roman Catholics and to keep them out of what the hon. Gentleman described as a Protestant-dominated work force. I do not deny that. Nor do I deny the savagery of that act and the spirit behind it. But I deny that the operation of the Agency will eliminate any such acts or solve the problem in any way. I do not believe that. I believe most sincerely that it will exacerbate the position. The thought in the mind of any man seeking a job will not be "what kind of a worker am I?" but "Who will they say I am? If I answer one way or another, shall I get the job?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of what the hon. Member for Belfast, West said about the attack on the workers at Dundonald, what about the attack on the 10 Protestants coming from their work at South Armagh? They were gunned down and destroyed. The savagery of the attack was such that parts of the human anatomy were found on the road—teeth and fingers. Was this attack to ensure that there was a fair balance of the work force in the factory from which these people came? Will the proposed Agency ensure that workers coming from such a factory will be protected from attack? Will the Agency ensure that such people are helped?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, West mentioned the Belfast rope works and the shipyard in Belfast and the imbalance of the work force there. He knows as well as I do that in Strabane there is a huge imbalance of work force in the industrial complexes. In the Adria knitting mills, more than three-quarters of the workers are Roman Catholics, as they are in the American Du Pont factory in Londonderry. Will the provisions of the Bill and the activities of the Agency redress the imbalance of the work force in Strabane and Londonderry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to get down to practicalities. I am not much good at understanding the technicalities of language. I am concerned only with how this measure will
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
affect the workers in Northern Ireland on the shop floor and in all the businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I support the Bill and the inclusion of Clause 1, I think that the point made by the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop) was valid. I hope that the Government will not pin too much faith on the establishment of the Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have in mind an example which could be of interest to the Committee. It relates to the Race Relations Board which, in a very different field, has been playing a predominant role in industrial parts of England. This example concerns its activities in the city of Leicester, which has severe racial problems. It has an Asian immigrant problem, and the Race Relations Board has been actively concerned in that field. It has recently sent the employers of the most successful textile and hosiery industries in Leicester a series of leaflets highlighting what can and cannot legally be done under the Race Relations Act. Some of the leaflets have been sent to me, because they illustrate in full colour the ethnic and historical backgrounds of the different groups of people that the companies may be expected to employ. The leaflets point out that they have different histories, are of different religions, should be treated differently and that management will trespass upon Government legislation if they treat any individual immigrant worker or group in a special way. The most successful companies in Leicester—and I confidently quote Courtaulds which is an internationally-renowned company—have been in touch with me during the last year to say how positively unhelpful they have found such information and documentation from the Race Relations Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop) said, a good employer like Courtaulds is only concerned with whether the man or the woman can do the job. Courtaulds deals with things in a big way and has found that the sort of people that it wants and the way that it has maintained such a remarkably successful industrial relations record for a number of years in Leicester is not by concerning itself an atom with a person's religion, background, where he comes from or where he is going. It is simply concerned with an individual's efficiency in doing a job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
As a result, companies stress that the well-meant intervention of the Race Relations Board, in sending the masses of posters which are supposed to be put up in works canteens stressing that these groups have different origins, different customs and religions, is positively unhelpful. They have, therefore, employed my assistance and the assistance of other Members of Parliament for the Leicester area to write to the Race Relations Board pointing this out to them. So, without trespassing on your time any longer, Mrs. Jeger—I respect that you wish to get this Bill through to a speedy conclusion—I urge the Government not to place too much stress upon the value of this new Fair Employment Agency which is to be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side as my hon. Friend the Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) has said, will certainly support the Bill. But it will not be a panacea for all the troubles in Ulster, and it would be wrong of the Government and misleading of the Minister to pretend that it was otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert J. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State, in an interjection during the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell), stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Working Party Report was widely circulated throughout industry in Northern Ireland and the response was overwhelming in favour of the proposals."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Standing Commitee H,</i> 2nd March 1976; c. 46.]</p></blockquote>
It is precisely that contention which we oppose, and I reiterate the point adequately made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South that we are opposed not to the underlying principle of this Bill, but to the proposals embodied in it which we believe will not help in best attaining the objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is ample evidence to support that contention, which all hon. Members and the right hon. Member on this bench hold. I refer to the comments made by Professor Richard Rose who clearly stated that there was no evidence for widespread, systematic discrimination in the public sector in Northern Ireland. This must be stressed again and again. So from which direction does the pressure come? We contend that there is little or no pressure in Northern Ireland for these proposals and for the inclusion of this clause in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
I move on quickly to say again, in dealing with bodies like the trade unions who would seek to have this clause retained in the Bill, that bodies such as the trade unions and the CBI can afford to talk in abstract terms. They trade in the innocuous. They trade in abstract terms because they do not have the difficulty of implementing these proposals. They are not faced with the nitty-gritties of trying to impose upon the community of Northern Ireland that which is intrinsically impossible to impose. We must therefore carefully watch the comments that are made in support of these proposals, which are said to emanate from such bodies such as the Trades Union Congress and the CBI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not risk incurring your wrath, Mrs. Jeger, by reacting to the comments made on Tuesday by the hon. Member for Belfast West (Mr. Fitt)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerard Fitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Please do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:—when he spoke of my opposition to the "Better life for all" campaign. The fact that I opposed the campaign on the basis that the Republicans and the Newry Trade Council have sponsored the movement, does not enable me to react to the hon. Gentleman's comment in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to emphasise that it is the most dangerous policy in which to indulge in Committees of this kind to name actual firms in Northern Ireland in order to try to substantiate one's case, on whichever side one sits. It is typical of the reckless behaviour at times exhibited by the hon. Gentleman who throws out name after name after name. If he wishes to indulge in that kind of political warfare, the head count at the end of the day would be very interesting indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In speaking to this clause the right hon. Gentleman also stated that Prime Ministers in Northern Ireland in the past had indulged in the most blatant kind of discrimination. The hon. Gentleman has once again indulged in half-truths. He may well have had in mind the incident when Lord Brookborough sacked two of his land stewards and was guilty of so-called discrimination. That is the kind of behaviour which has given rise to this legislation and to the provisions of this clause. The hon. Member for Belfast, West alluded to that kind of incident in his supporting speech. That was half the truth. He did not tell us about Cardinal Dalton's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
statement that it was no sin against the Church for a Roman Catholic to be dishonest when he was employed by a Protestant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was a fundamental part of the reason, and it brings us to the heart of the matter. My right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South tried to have clarified whether Parts II, II and IV of this Bill were mere elaborations of the directions embodied in Clause 1. The right hon. Gentleman stated that Clause 1 was not a further invitation for the agency to probe and investigate beyond the parameters of Parts II, III and IV. It is my contention that if Clause 1 merely shares the same degree of authority as the other parts of the Bill, and that Clause 1 can initiate only the same degree of intervention as the other parts, conversely, Clause 1 is not less powerful than any other part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we permit the clause in very general and imprecise terms to talk about the elimination of discrimination, we are not taking due cognisance of the fact that this legislation cannot accommodate extenuating circumstances, special situations which must, of necessity, lead to discriminatory judgment between one worker and another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is at that point that we come back to the incident mentioned by the hon. Member for Belfast, West, in speaking for the inclusion of this clause, because at the end of the day there are certain pressures on employers on which this legislation cannot help them. It is poor legislation and dangerous legislation. I do not want to labour the point that was made when referring to the statement by the Cardinal of the Church, but the employer in that case was faced with a simple choice between allowing a man to accept the authority of someone other than the man who provided him with a living and his bread and butter. These could be thought of as the material differences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee, therefore, to reconsider before allowing the clause to be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the end of a long and protracted debate on Clause 1. The Government recognise that there is a good deal of importance attached to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
functions of the agency. It is right that we should have explored the matter in some depth, because in many ways it is one of the central parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to its justification, the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) talked about objectives and methods, saying that there was no disagreement in the Committee about objectives, but that there was disagreement about methods. I wish that were true, but I do not believe that to be a fact. The Government believe that the Bill combines objectives and methods in a way which will try—we do not put it higher than that—to form a framework and background upon which we could improve the sectarian divide which so patently exists in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we want proof of what I have just mentioned, we only have to listen to the Northern Ireland Members speaking in the Committee. They are living proof that, from whatever side of the argument they speak, this issue exists in Northern Ireland, that the necessity for this clause is not a figment of either the previous administration or the present one, or that we merely decided to have an agency and a Clause 1 and a Bill as such. The pressure for the Bill, and indeed for the clause, has come from Northern Ireland itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop) when he refuted some other charges. The composition of work forces in the sectarian sense just trips off his tongue—three-quarters here, two-thirds there. These things are known. But the agency will not disturb waters or go into areas which are not already clearly known in the minds of people in both communities in Northern Ireland. Evidence was produced on Second Reading. The hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) wrote to me about a discrimination case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, this Bill will deal with individuals as well. Clause I will also cover this point. There is evidence. I could catalogue the evidence which I have had, as a Minister operating in Northern Ireland, dealing with large numbers of people and with individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took the point made by the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr) about the agency and whether or not this agency
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
would inflict itself upon industry on the basis—to adopt the hon. Gentleman's analogy—of the Race Relations Board as such. We have just received a report. This is germane, Mrs. Jeger, because the Race Relations Board wants similar powers to those in Clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bet they do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, they want the powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Within industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Within industry. I will not be distracted, Mrs. Jeger. This is germane. The Race Relations Commission has just issued a report commenting on the improvement in race relations within Great Britain, and suggesting that the anti-discrimination legislation was important in that context. It has asked for similar powers to those which are contained within the Bill before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not doubt the word of the Race Relations Board for a moment, but I think that the Minister should remind the Committee that this Board has a vested interest in its own future. It is hardly likely to issue an adverse report which would condemn its past activities. I am not saying that the report is not accurate and valid, but I think that the Minister should add to that proviso.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the Commission, not the Board, that commented on the work of the Board and on the improved race relations. I hope that answers that particular point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like now to come to a central point of this clause—the consultations that the hon. Member for Armagh has made in seeking information about the value or otherwise not only of the Bill, but touching upon the clause itself. Evidence from the CBI has been given to the Committee this morning by the right hon. Member for Down, South. I found the right hon. Gentleman's arguments interesting. They were, in some instances, diametrically opposed. He told us this morning, as he did on Tuesday morning, that bodies such as the CBI and ICTU, the trade unions official body, were divorced from everyday life in Northern Ireland, and that these official bodies did not know what they were talking about and did not reflect the real views of, say, member firms of the CBI or the individual trade unionists of ICTU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
Then the hon. Gentleman produces a letter and turns the argument completely on its head with the justification that the CBI—this important body representative of organisations in Northern Ireland—now had doubts about parts of the Bill, not least Clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Armagh told the Committee that he had consulted a number of firms. We have not been told the exact number, but we understand that he has had replies from about 60 firms covering about 20,000 employees. We must remember that in Northern Ireland there are about 494,000 workers and 31,000 places of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The questionnaire issued by the hon. Member and the letter which accompanied it are founded on a wholly inaccurate premise about the Bill's contents. The letter states that the Fair Employment Agency will be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…empowered to require employers to record and disclose the religious affiliations of their workforce."</p></blockquote>
That is totally false, as I said on Tuesday. There is no provision in the Bill to require an employer to obtain or record information about the religious beliefs of his employees. The questionnaire implies that the Bill provides for the keeping of a register of religious beliefs of employees. That is also untrue. The Bill requires the agency, as one of its functions, to keep under review patterns and trends of employment. For that purpose, it is empowered to obtain information about the religious beliefs of employees. It may be necessary to record that information in global form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is very different from keeping a register in which, as the questionnaire implies, detailed information would be kept of the religious belief of each employee in each enterprise. The Bill has specific safeguards against employees being obliged to provide information about their religious beliefs, even to the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The questionnaire implied that the Bill would promote a quota system based on the concept of a balanced work force and that that would be the duty of the agency. That is incorrect. Reverse discrimination, like any other form of discrimination, would be unlawful under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not dealing with imagination. We are setting up an agency to lay the basis so that it can start doing the work.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
I used the word "intervention" and the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) picked it up. I do not withdraw that word. The agency is interventionist in the sense of trying to achieve its objects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the clarification and the assurances that the right hon. Gentleman has given us. No doubt later we shall be able to debate in detail what he has said and the powers of the agency. But will he interpret for me the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of the investigation, the Agency may require any person who in its opinion is able to furnish information or produce documents relevant to the investigation to furnish any such information or produce any such document"?</p></blockquote>
Would the right hon. Gentleman not agree that in an interpretation of those words, the agency would be empowered to ask an employer to produce the evidence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The employer can be asked for evidence. Neither an employee, nor an employer can be asked to disclose their religion or the religion of other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made this morning to the CBI and its attitude to the Fair Employment Agency. I want to put on record the views of the official trade union movement in Northern Ireland, which says that the proposed Fair Employment Agency would have a major contribution to make in eradicating any elements of social injustice in this matter. It expresses its concern at the undue delay in dealing with the matter and urges the Government to move at the maximum speed to see that this agency is created. There is evidence</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>that there is a link between objectives and methods. If we have the same objectives, we need methods to put them into force. Nobody has suggested in this Committee—although we have had these criticisms against Clause 1—any other methods of dealing with this problem and nobody has denied that the issue is not a real one in Northern Ireland. There is evidence, day in, day out, of this problem. I feel that if we had such an agency operating it would be in the interests of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland who want to get away from discrimination and who want to be employed on the basis of their job and their abilities. Unfortunately that is not so at the moment. On that basis I would ask the Committee to support Clause 1.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you have perspicaciously observed, Mrs. Jeger, Amendment No. 8 hangs together with this amendment, so that if this amendment is accepted, the effect of the clause will be to authorise the agency to make charges for services which it makes available. Since, quite clearly, it is carrying out some of its duties under the remaining parts of the Bill, it may provide services the cost of which ought not to fall upon the public. We see no reason why that power to charge for services actually provided for the purposes of the Bill by the agency should not be returned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do, however, take very grave objection to the activities displayed before the eyes of the agency in the different paragraphs of subsection (1) which go some way to fulfilling and giving body to our worst fears about the Parkinsonian proclivities which such a body is, in the nature of things, likely to demonstrate. We have the advantage that in the course of the preceding debate two speeches were made which bear directly upon the desirability or otherwise of the contents of subsection (1). The first was the observation from the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Mr. Litterick) to the effect that in Northern Ireland what is known as religious discrimination—what it means, when it is happening, when it is not happening—are not matters of secrecy or obscurity. They are not matters calling for profound and scientific research. Those concerned know very well what the realities are and whether discrimination is at work. That is one valuable factor in our consideration of Clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other speech was that of the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr) in relation to the activities of a not entirely dissimilar body, the Race Relations Board. His evidence—and I can certainly corroborate it from my own experience—was that the performance by that Board of the kind of activities indicated in subsection (1) was proving counter-productive and was exciting complaint from the employers who had the best record in the matters with which that Board was concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I am myself the child of two teachers, I cannot help referring here to the unkind proverb that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Those who can, do, those who cannot, teach."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
It is brought irresistibly to one's mind as one reads the contents of subsection (1). Who will these people be who, instead of themselves being personnel managers, running successful businesses, are to take service with the agency and give advice on matters concerned with equality of opportunity? It will happen inevitably that the kind of person who spends years of his life as the servant of the Fair Employment Agency, going round giving advice on matters connected with equality of opportunity to those who are actually doing the job and know perfectly well, to use a slang expression, "what gives", will find that there is a need for his services and his advice. He is paid to give it and he will trot around giving it. It will not be particularly expert advice and, for reasons which the hon. Member for Harborough in another context illustrated, it may be positively counter-productive. Then we move on to paragraphs (
	<i>b</i>) and (
	<i>c</i>). I must say, with reference to Amendment No. 7, that it seems to me that the official Opposition has picked upon what are perhaps the most absurd of all the paragraphs of subsection 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it not ludicrous to imagine the agency running weekend, weekly and fortnightly courses to which people in industry, who have jobs to do, are called to attend training courses on not discriminating, and where their keep and fees will be paid directly by their firms and indirectly by the consumer public?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The realities which lie behind the findings of the working party, that religious discrimination exists to some degree as a fact of life in employment in Northern Ireland, are not secret. Training managers and shop stewards in what is or is not equality of opportunity is not a proper subject matter for training courses. The same comment applies to recognising religious and political discrimination. There will be lectures on the incidence of religious discrimination, diagrams, statistical tables and lectures on the various aspects of discrimination. Once this thing gets going it has a momentum of its own. It grows by feeding—
	<i>"l'appetit vient en mangeant"</i>—"the appetite comes with eating". You allowed previously, Mrs. Jeger—provided there was a translation—the use of the language of one of our partners, for the moment, in the European Economic Community.

The appetite for providing training
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
courses and holding conferences will come with the eating. The provision of training courses and the holding of conferences is an industry in itself. As you will know, Mrs. Jeger, there are actually firms which make a living by promoting training courses and telling people how to run training courses. They run around inciting firms to hold training courses which they would not otherwise have thought of holding. There are firms which hold conferences, whose whole business is to maintain conferences. From their point of view the more conferences there are the better. What a blessing for the industry! Here is a new Bill which sets up an agency and gives that agency the power, to discharge its duties, to provide training courses and hold conferences. I agree with the official Opposition that these are offensively absurd paragraphs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to paragraph (
	<i>d</i>). There has been a controversy, which will have to be carried further on later clauses of the Bill, between the Minister and my hon. Friends and myself as to what kind of information the agency will elicit and how it will elicit and record it. I do not believe that if the agency is given the power to undertake research into equality of opportunity it will not be driven into compiling records and going around with questionnaires, making the precise inquiries of which my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) is afraid and then—as specified in paragraph (
	<i>e</i>)—disseminating information about the agency's activities or anything to which those activities relate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the agency is not to do harm—and I make this assertion with some confidence—then the more quietly, tactfully and inconspicuously it goes about its duties in Parts II and III of the Bill, the more likely it is to escape doing harm and achieve perhaps some measure of good. But we cannot add to the Bill anything more dangerous to the success of the Agency than the powers in Clause 2(1). It may be said, of course, that all the clause does is to say that the agency may do this. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will say that these are only permissive powers and that there is no obligation. He may ask "What harm does the Committee find in the Agency having the power to hold conferences?" I will tell the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No agency which is set up under an Act which contains the provisions of Clause
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
2(1) will have the face, a year later, in its first annual report to say "We have provided no training courses because we did not consider they would be helpful or appropriate. We have held no conferences because we considered that they would have been a waste of time for those who would have attended and an unnecessary waste of public money. We have undertaken no research because we find in the cases with which we have had to deal that those involved in discrimination knew perfectly well the cause and, if there was a remedy, where that remedy lay. We have not thought it conducive to a proper prosecution of our purposes to take formal steps for disseminating information other than this report which we are statutorily laying before Parliament."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is totally unrealistic to imagine that any self-respecting new agency set up under a statute would take that modest view of what was expected of it. Even if it is not provided—as I fear it may be—with the legal advice which I was presupposing in an earlier debate, it will read the Bill. The agency will think that it has deduced from Clause 2 what is the intention of the Committee and the House. It will say "Parliament must, in giving us these powers, have expected and, indeed, intended that we should use them. Parliament has actually thought it proper that we should provide training courses, hold conferences and undertake research. Who are we to set ourselves against Parliament and say that these activities are wasteful and counter-productive?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that this clause is an invitation to exactly the kind of activity and Parkinsonism on the part of the Agency which my hon. Friends and I most fear. We do not fear it privately—because it will be another nonsensical paper factory like those other paper factories from which we get glossies through the post week by week and day by day—but because the clause will almost direct the agency to become the sort of busybody which will render it positively dangerous in the context of that sub-degree of religious discrimination which exists as a fact of life within employment in Northern Ireland. That is why we seek to limit this clause to a power to make charges for what services the agency performs in the course of carrying out its other duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we said earlier, we believe that if we were to have this agency it should be sufficiently small to be disciplined and controlled. We hope that it would have functions conferred upon it which it was capable of discharging in a meaningful and effective way. We consider those functions should be primarily advisory and educational.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we establish an agency with that aim in mind and we people it with personnel who are likely to see it in that light, is it not ridiculous to start listing the things that it will have to do? We could argue that we would have to people it with personnel with industrial and academic training experience. These people will then set about their task. In many ways we feel that we are limiting them by listing functions in this way, and are seriously questioning, to some extent, the ability and motivation of the people we select. We believe, as my right hon. Friend said, that it should be allowed to develop freely, slowly and sensitively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept, and hope, that it will quietly try to assess objectively the true situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard more than once the broad generalisation from both sides of the Committee about the situation 
	<i>vis-a-vis</i> religious discrimination and employment in Northern Ireland, and its effects. If we are to have this agency, let it see part of its function as being able to make an objective assessment of the effects of sectarian conflict on industry, of the effect of the location of the plant 
	<i>vis-a-vis</i> the proportion of employees in the plant, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that if it is going to make any progress, it will have to work on that basis, lay the groundwork, and make some assessment of the situation, which we hope will be done in an objective way. There must be an attempt to make an analysis of the situation. How the analysis is to be attempted is contained in the Bill, but I do not want to go into the details now. When the analysis is complete and the agency is getting to grips with the problems, it must consider the best ways of making progress. There is a distinguished member of the Committee who is familiar with the whole field of training, so perhaps we shall benefit from his experience, but I think the agency will have to say, "Is there a particular need for this plan on which we are to embark? To suggest that the first thing that the agency should consider is to establish training courses is, I would say, dangerously presumptuous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
Reference has been made to Courtaulds which, not only in Northern Ireland but in the rest of the United Kingdom, set an example for employers in their mode of operation and personnel policies. Courtaulds employs almost 10,000 people in Northern Ireland, and to suggest that that company was guilty of discrimination would be almost an obscenity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet if one were to analyse the work forces in different factories throughout Northern Ireland, a superficial examination of the statistics might indicate discrimination, although I am convinced that that was not intended. To suggest to a company that it should send members of its personnel division to a training course to be lectured on how to provide equality of opportunity is such a nonsense that I find it hard to comprehend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one is not going to ask Courtaulds, how is one to ask all the other small employers of 20, 30 or 40 people to come along? To list them in this form is objectionable. If there were a training course, what would be its objective? What would be the content? How would it be conducted, and by whom? Would it be lectures, slides, tables and graphs? Is one element of the agency going to be a training element? Would the industrial training boards be used, perhaps? Should we not find a way of establishing a liaison between the agency and the training boards? But would not that suggest that, to some extent, the training boards were already guilty of not carrying out this aspect of their work for the past seven or eight years in Northern Ireland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us with a little experience of training know the difficulties of training boards in attracting people to training courses, conferences and the like. Unless this can be done in a more imaginative way, those troubles will be quadrupled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points that I have made on training courses apply also to conferences. How could one bring 500 to 600 people—who, I presume, have to come from the personnel divisions of major companies—to a one-day conference in order to talk to them on equality of opportunity and the means of providing this? The majority of people may already have qualifications from the Institute of Personnel Management, the British Institute of Management and other professional bodies. Would it not be insulting them to suggest that they even attend the conference?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
We have said that the undertaking of research is covered later in the Bill and we shall eventually deal with it, but to tell the agency that its function is to disseminate information is condescending and insulting. If we are to have sensitive, intelligent and able people manning the agency, it will have to know how to proceed in fulfilling its functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that by listing them in this way, not only does one incite them to perform what they may think is unnecessary, but one may equally limit them. That is why we have produced these amendments which, we argue, would leave the whole scope of the agency wider and open to its own discretion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Neave</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Committee knows, this Bill was based upon the Report of the Working Party under the chairmanship of my hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee). As a matter of historical fact, he informs me that the previous Conservative administration did not draft this Bill. It was drafted by the present administration and, for this reason, I want to say that we feel extremely sceptical about Clause 2 and, in particular, subsection (1) (
	<i>b</i>) and (
	<i>c</i>) which the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) described as absurd. I do not think that is an understatement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to the van Straubenzee report in this connection, because this clause is in no way based on the report of the Working Party. Paragraph 135 of the report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Fair Employment Agency has an important role to play as a continuous educator and communicator and in this way to attempt to replace fear and misrepresentation with knowledge and understanding. We received various suggestions as to how this role might be fulfilled but it is our view that decisions on this score are best left to the Agency itself to make."</p></blockquote>
That seems to be quite unexceptional and, therefore, the question arises whether we should include paragraphs (
	<i>b</i>) and (
	<i>c</i>). I hope I can persuade the right hon. Gentleman to look at my suggestion again that he should leave out those two paragraphs, and, if you will allow it, Mrs. Jeger, we should wish to divide on Amendment No. 7. I think that he ought to consider this amendment, because first there is the question of unnecessary expenditure, which we should all have regard to at the present tine. Secondly, does he think it wise that in
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
introducing a Bill of this kind and setting up an agency, he should cause such irritation to employers by having to attend training courses on what is religious discrimination?—a subject which we have not yet defined in relation to this Bill, though we shall soon come to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think, in the present context of tension and violence in Northern Ireland, that it would be unwise to have a conference of 600 people deciding what religious discrimination was. We shall press Amendment No. 7, unless the right hon. Gentleman has something to say about that. Having been in industry for a long time and having seen successfully the operation of the Race Relations Act, I do not think it necessary to call employers and others up for conferences and training courses to tell them how they should operate that Act. This depends very much on common sense within the work itself and, of course, there are the powers of the agency if the employers do not comply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to see people annoyed to that extent, because I believe in the objectives of the Bill. While I wish the agency success, please do not add to it too much legislative paraphernalia such as paragraphs (
	<i>b</i>) and (
	<i>c</i>) providing training courses and holding conferences. I believe that these paragraphs are unnecessary and I have considerable scepticism about the clause as a whole. We are prepared to press Amendment No. 7 unless the right hon. Gentleman can tell us that he agrees that the paragraphs are unnecessary. They are part of the agency's duties and it should be left to the agency to decide whether it wants to do such things. There should not, however, be legislative provision. Such paragraphs should not be in a statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must tell the right hon.

If the agency provides services which people require, and it feels that those services should be charged for, it can charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, apart from this clause. Two arguments have been developed. The hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) has already raised the point that the previous administration did not draft the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
Bill. It is the Government's responsibility. It closely follows the report of the working party which his hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee) chaired. The major difference, as he knows, is that we have included the public as well as the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke of education and training. The Government have included these so that the agency—and this is the keyword—"may" carry out these functions if it so desires. It would obviously carry them out in a manner which is acceptable to the people in Northern Ireland. We would not expect to have inflammatory conferences attended by 600 to 700 people. This Bill, and indeed this clause, deals with the changing attitudes of people to this issue. There must be education. People need to be brought together. The hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) said that the large firms may be able to take care of themselves? He asked what would happen about the small firms. As many people in this room know, in another context, in industrial training and other spheres it is often the small firm—not the large one—which needs assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman may have misunderstood me. I was saying that if large firms said that they did not require this assistance or did not want to attend these training courses, how would we convince the small firms to attend? If the large firms were to be present at training courses they may well be listening to irrelevancies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point. My answer is that basically we need these facilities. I agree with what the right hon. Gentleman said about the growth industry in conferences and courses. Frankly, some of them are not very useful or helpful, and it would be naive of me to say otherwise. Some are extremely useful and important. I would have thought that conferences and educational facilities, which need not be conducted on the basis of taking everybody away to the seaside for a week, would enable the agency to elicit information of which it was not already aware. It might discover where there is a shortage of work or workers at a particular plant. This sort of information may come out in the process of an exchange of views. The agency could explain its philosophy. This Bill is based on persuasion. There are
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
statutory powers behind it, but persuasion is the basis of it, and we cannot persuade people unless we talk to them and bring them together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Neave</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman made the point that I would have made, namely that this Bill should be based on persuasion. Is there not a danger that in putting into this Bill provision for training courses and conferences, people may think that they are under an obligation to attend such courses, and the agency, may think that it is under an obligation to hold them? The agency will become bureaucratic in style. Would the Minister note that there is no recommendation in the van Straubenzee Report supporting this clause or any part of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause, in principle, supports education and the provision of information. The key word, as I have already said, is "may". There is no statutory obligation on the agency to hold conferences and I do not think that the worst fears of the right hon. Gentleman for Down, South—that there will be conferences for the sake of them—are well-founded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the agency will read this debate and take to heart some of the constructive things that have been said. It has been said that if we were to delete these two clauses the agency would probably be free to do these things in any case. The hon. Member for Armagh pointed this out, when he suggested that the clause might be widening the agency's powers rather than narrowing them. We are saying that we believe these functions may be needed. We want them to be—and I make this clear to the Committee—carried out in a circumspect manner and carried out with a knowledge of the expenditure that would be involved. We are, however, dealing with attitudes and the changing of attitudes, and, as such, education is the central point. As many Members of this Committee probably know, when people in Northern Ireland who have never previously been brought together across the religious divide, meet in an atmosphere removed from their normal environment they have found that the other side is not as bad as it appeared and does not have two heads. People have been brought together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may know of the work that is done with young children by many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
worthwhile organisations, such as the Church, to bring them together and to try to remove that divide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We say that these functions—and I hope that the Committee does not feel that we are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut—may be used and I have tried to explain how they may be used. We would not want the agency to abuse them, but it is important that the Committee should spell out the direction in which it feels the agency should go in its educational role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that after listening to the right hon. Gentleman's defence of the clause I have more anxieties about it than when we first approached it. I can assure him that the clause does not resemble a sledgehammer. It brings to my mind a picture, not so much of a sledgehammer, as an immense pile, rising out of sight, of illustrated brochures, programmes for conferences and research reports. I fear that that is what we are asking for if we put this clause in the Bill. We have certainly been helped by the assurance of the right hon. Gentleman that the clause is unnecessary. To that, I would say a most hearty "Amen" and "hear, hear". He was candid with the Committee, and it is most refreshing when a Minister, who will presently advise the Committee to agree to a clause, tells the Committee that the same powers would be available even if the clause was not in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman does not want to misquote me. He was very candid with the Committee and, indeed, it is most professional when a Minister who is presently going to advise the Committee to add a clause to the Bill tells the Committee that the same powers would be available even if the clause were not in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the right hon. Gentleman does not want to misquote me. I was saying that his hon. Friend had suggested that if these clauses were not included, the Bill would have wider powers. I was perhaps being ironical, which is a very dangerous thing to be in Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is, indeed. I am not being ironical when I say that that I understood the right hon. Gentleman to say that if this clause were not in the Bill he considered it probable, if not certain, that the agency would, if it thought fit, be able
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
to do any or all of these things. That really crystallises the argument, and the argument is a substantial one. If the agency at some moment thought to itself "The crucial thing to do now is usefully to have a conference of a certain kind of certain people", it can do it. But if we put this clause into the Bill we are, in fact, pushing the agency into turning itself into a different kind of body, pushing its employees and general organisation into a different sort of organisation from that which it would otherwise be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) that the expressions quoted from the van Straubenzee report embodying the word "education" were certainly not intended as an invitation to engage in this type of activity, certainly not on a statutory basis. Unless I gravely misunderstood the context from which the hon. Gentleman quoted, education was being used in the general sense, with which I do not necessarily agree, that this kind of legislation and this kind of body exercise an educational function on the community and upon society. I am sure that was what was meant by the van Straubenzee report—that by dealing with a series of cases within the framework of the Bill, by exercising its duties and powers under Parts II to IV, people would learn to behave differently. That is what I think was meant by the educational function of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But when I listened to what the right hon. Gentleman said about the contents of the conference's training courses, and so on, I became even more alarmed. He said that it was to be one of the functions of these training courses and conferences to change the attitudes of people towards discrimination. I really cannot conceive that, whatever rooted bases of discrimination exist—of course, they exist—in Northern Ireland any remedy will be produced by the agency summoning employers and employees to a conference and lecturing about their attitudes towards discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, by the time it was examined by the van Straubenzee working party, discrimination had become such that all the report could say was that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it existed to some degree as a fact of life in employment",</p></blockquote>
then it is not by lectures, sermonising and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
exhortation over weeks and weeks that progress will be continued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was especially alarmed—I was going to say shocked—by the analogy drawn by the hon. Gentleman between the activities of the agency and those directed towards young children drawn from various parts of the community in Northern Ireland. This goes far to fulfil almost the worst fears of my hon. Friends and myself as to what the agency might get up to in the course of these activities if it is positively induced to undertake them by the fact that this superfluous clause is put into an Act of Parliament. As I have said before, I am sure that the official Opposition have pinpointed in paragraphs (
	<i>b</i>) and (
	<i>c</i>) the precise activities against which the Committee ought to take a stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Abingdon divides the Committee on Amendment No. 7, we shall support him. On the other hand, since I take it that Amendment No. 7 could be put if Amendment No. 6 were not moved, I accordingly propose not to press Amendment No. 6 so that Amendment No. 7 can be moved, and I am fortified in this by the assurance of the Minister of State that the agency will lose nothing if the motion that "Clause 2 stand part of the Bill" is successfully opposed by my hon. Friends and myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>MEANING OF "EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY"</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 9, in page 2, line 27, leave out second "of" and insert "professing".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take the following Amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 10, in page 2, line 27, after "different", insert "or no".</p>

	<p>No. 11, in page 2, line 28, leave out second "of" and insert "professing".</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears to me that if we leave the wording of this clause as it stands, we have two difficulties, one of which is related to an accompanying clause. We have the difficulty of discovering first what a person actually believes, and the accompanying difficulty of discriminating against, or not including, people who have no religious profession and no religious belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore ask that we give very careful consideration to these two amendments. I ask the Committee to look carefully at the processes by which we hope to obtain information about one's religious belief or profession. It is very difficult to ascertain precisely what one believes. No one really knows what a person believes, but it is easy to evaluate a profession once it is stated either verbally or in writing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of this part of the clause as drafted is illogical and impossible to enforce. It does not take cognisance of the fact that there are those who will endeavour to obtain equal opportunity in industry who do not make a religious profession of any kind. Those people are not catered for in this part of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Committee will not regard these amendments as either merely drafting amendments or as captious. In this proposed statute we are approaching a subject which is probably new to legislation. It is perhaps the first attempt to define religious discrimination, and we ought to take seriously the formulation which we adopt for the purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also remember that ultimately, although the initial action lies with
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
the agency, the matters which we are laying down will be justiciable in courts of law and may be the subject of appeal upon interpretation of the law. It is therefore our business to ensure that the definitions express exactly what Parliament means and that those expressions are in themselves logical and defensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) has drawn attention to one of the difficulties which we meet when talking about religious belief. Here and in other parts of the Bill my hon. Friends and I have made a serious attempt to substitute in the wording of the Bill the objective for the subjective. It is only upon that which is objectively ascertainable that the law, as we are trying to make it, can successfully bite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first difficulty which we encounter is this reference to religious belief. Of course we are all tempted to make light of the matter and I think everyone when first reading the Bill would have said "I quite understand what that means". Perhaps in the context of Northern Ireland we think we understand what it means, but we ought to beware of writing a Bill which we ourselves interpret out of our background without regard to the words we use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said on Second Reading, and I repeat, that too often in Northern Ireland the entire community is divided simply into two, which are mis-called "Catholic and Protestant". If one is not a Catholic or a Protestant, one is virtually regarded as not coming within the scope of human species.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But religious belief is varied not only in terms of its profession and the form it takes, but as it is entertained literally and subjectively, it is far more various. It is relevant to the wording of the clause that I myself as an Anglican regard it as one of the virtues of the Church as established by law that it can bring together into the same observances people whose interpretation of these observances and whose underlying beliefs if they could be exposed, might be found to be very different, but in that sense it is a comprehensive Church.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In speaking of religious belief we are thus dealing first with something which is much more diffuse and subtle than the crude classification into Catholic and Protestant which I personally find anomalous and offensive. We are also dealing with the relationship between outward affiliation and practice and inward conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
Unless the right hon. Gentleman can produce very clear statutory justification for doing so, it is no use saying that when we say "religious belief" we really mean "religious profession". We really mean that which appears about a man from his outward behaviour and his words. If that is what we mean, if we are making law, we should find the means of saying so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both in this amendment, with the word "professing", and elsewhere in the Bill, we have put forward a formulation of which the object is to substitute the objective for the subjective. Nor is it any use our pretending that what we really mean by "religious belief" is adherence to a specific creed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will content myself with one example. The great bulk of all Christian professions throughout the world, though not the whole, are Trinitarian and acknowledge the doctrine of the Trinity. If, however, we are confronted with a Unitarian, an Anglican or a Roman Catholic, religious belief requires us to apply our minds to the question whether one does, in fact, believe in the doctrine of the Trinity. That to me is what is naturally meant by religious belief: religious belief is the content of one's religious belief, if English words have their natural meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman, listening to that, might be tempted to retort that, of course, I know perfectly well that that is not what the Bill is aimed at. Of course I do, and that is my point: that we are failing at present to state on the face of the Bill what we are really talking about, and that is what we describe in our amendment as "religious profession". If the right hon. Gentleman can find a better word, we will gladly accept it, but we say that we must define profession, affiliation or what you will—that which is objective about a man, that which his fellow-workers, his potential employer and his neighbours can see about him and think that they know about him. It is on that that the Bill is required to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I briefly deal with the second of the amendments to which my hon. Friend referred. Once again, maybe the implications of the Northern Ireland context have got into the draftsmen, as they have entirely ignored people who are of no religious belief, unless to be an atheist is a religious belief, which I find very diffi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
cult to accept, and unless to be an agnostic is to have a religious belief. This Bill, for good or ill, makes no attempt to deal with—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the right hon. Gentleman clarify this point, because obviously the Bill deals with people with no belief as well as those with belief? Clause 57(2) deals with this, at the top of page 42. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman would like to have a brief look at that, as it meets the point and is germane to this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for referring to Clause 57(2). But first of all, this subsection will not help us—or, at least, it helps us only in a very indirect way—over the first problem. I can see that it might be argued that the word "supposed"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Professed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious not to spend more time than is necessary to ensure that we are satisfied with our definition and our drafting. In due course we shall come to Clause 57 but I am far from convinced that the word "supposed" there meets in any way fully the problem which my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) raised on the ascertainment of religious belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked us to take it that Clause 57(2) says that atheism is a religious belief—by virtue of the rule that Parliament can do anything. The provision can, therefore, include the atheist in the scope of the protection against discrimination. I beg leave to doubt whether the object of eliminating religion or irreligion from the considerations, which are later defined in the Bill, is satisfactorily met by subsection (2) of Clause 57. I put it to the right hon. Gentleman—he will have later opportunity to consider the redrafting of the Bill—that it would be clearer and more straightforward if we placed those who might well be objected to as known atheists by fellow-workers or employers on a basis of equality in the terminology of the clause. I must admit that the right hon. Gentleman showed no disposition to do so, but I am sure that he will take seriously the importance of getting our definitions right at this stage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Neave</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like the hon. Gentleman to look at this group of amendments because I think that the point that has been made is a serious one. With respect, his reference to Clause 57(2) at the top of page 42 did not sufficiently answer the points that have been put about religious belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 57(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this Act references to a person's religious belief or political opinion"—</p></blockquote>
political opinion is not, in fact, covered by this clause—
	<br><blockquote><p>"include references to his supposed religious belief or"</p></blockquote>
—presumably supposed—
	<br><blockquote><p>political opinion."</p></blockquote>
That is not the same thing as what he professes to believe in, and this is what we are dealing with here. He really should look at that point again. To refer to Clause 57(2) is not a fair answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Amendment No. 10 and the question whether after "different" "or no" should be inserted, again there is a point here. Certainly people exist who describe themselves as agnostics or atheists, as the right hon. Gentleman said, and it is not sufficient to rely on Clause 57(2) to cover this either. One of the things we want to avoid is too much labelling of religious belief in the whole context of Northern Ireland. Many of us may think that the violence is not necessarily a war resulting from people holding different religious beliefs, but that it is a war between people acting criminally to promote violence, who may be described as gangsters and gunmen, and we want to avoid that reference, so the existence of people who hold no religious belief should be acknowledged in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I want to say to the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) that I interrupted the right hon. Member for Down, South because I felt that it was right to draw to the Committee's attention that Clause 57(2) deals with the non-believer, if one likes, as well as the believer. These people must be identified, and I accept that they must be identified under the terms of the Bill on an equal basis. Coming back to what the right hon. Gentleman said—and I shall return to the hon. Member for Abingdon shortly—I thought that I was trying to help the Committee in giving the information about Clause 57(2) because it deals with
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
what we recognise is a difficult area of definition. It is not easy to define. If a person, for instance, professes Catholicism as such, that is his supposed belief. That is one indication of professing belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the amendment—and this is the crucial point—if the word "profess" were to be inserted, that would, in a sense restrict the Bill. It would cut it down dramatically. To restrict the Bill to those who profess a religious belief would be to confine it far too narrowly because more people have a religious belief than are prepared to profess. Thus acceptance of the right hon. Gentleman's amendment would result in the Bill being applicable to a smaller number of inhabitants in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem to which this Bill is directed pervades the whole community in Northern Ireland. I therefore think that for the terminology "profess" to be submitted in this Bill for wider definition that we have given it would restrict it. A person might easily be identifiable, in the terms of the Bill, as being a member of the minority or majority community. But he might not profess or want to profess that he is, for instance, a practising Roman Catholic, a Unitarian or any other religion. So within the terms of the Bill we strongly oppose this amendment because it would dramatically reduce the scope of the Bill as such.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Minister confusing the word "profession" with the word "practice"? He seems to be suggesting that it is important, if one professes a belief, naturally and overtly to practise that belief. That is not the case. For instance, if one is admitted to hospital in Northern Ireland the number of people who do not profess, by a definite verbal statement, to belong to a particular religious denomination is small. But the number of people who overtly practise their religious persuasion could be very considerable. So I believe that there is an important and significant confusion of terms here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said already that this definition is an extremely difficult business, and I think that the Committee recognises that. I agree with the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell), who said that perhaps we are entering uncharted waters in this form of legislation, and we obviously wish to get it right, or as near right as is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
Therefore, we must again read—and this is the answer to the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford)—this clause along with Clause 57(2) because they are directly related. I believe that the two clauses together cover the area, and that is why we are opposed to accepting this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In some ways this brings us right to the heart of the matter, because it deals with identifying and categorising people according to their religious beliefs. If we are to accept the argument of the Minister of State, there is no reason why we should not have tatooed under the forelock "P" or "RC". Then we would know for certain. We shall then have to decide when we will tattoo that mark: after christening, the age of consent or so on. We are getting to a situation where we are discussing whether people in Northern Ireland have to be categorised in these clear and distinct terms. If we do as I suggest, there can never be any confusion because one can move one's hair back and show the mark on one's forehead. We are almost getting to that stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1971 Census, contrary to what the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Mr. Litterick) said, it was not simply people walking around with orange and green stripes on them. In the 1971 Census 150,000 people refused to identify themselves by religious category. One cannot make the precise distinction which is being alleged here. The Methodist Church in its reply to me made the point: what is happening to the increasing number of people in Northern Ireland who will neither disclose their religion, the school that they attended, nor any other information which might identify them in a religious sense?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two employers who wrote to me, but who did not complete the questionnaire, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At the present time I could not tell you the religious beliefs of our work force".</p></blockquote>
If I were to disclose the names of these two individuals, which I cannot do because they have asked for confidentiality, hon. Members would appreciate why they could not reveal the religious persuasions of their work force. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>…and we have no religious problems within the factory. There is no mention in our application form of either religion or school attended. This is done purposely: I find it com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
pletely repugnant to contemplate being required to report religious beliefs."</p></blockquote>
If we are now considering the matter in these specific terms, are we not getting to the stage where we shall have to ask people to ensure—taking account of the safeguards that may be contained in the Bill to protect the individual—that wherever possible they should be in a position, if so required, to disclose the religious affiliation of an employee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with academic interest to the discussion which has taken place on this amendment. We may be discussing an academic meaning in the interpretation of certain wording. But what does it mean in reality in Northern Ireland, which is where this legislation will apply? Will a man be prevented from getting a job because he is a Catholic or was born of Catholic parents, or lives in a Catholic area? Will it mean that a man, because he was born of Protestant parents, lives as a Protestant and was a member of the Orange Lodge, will be prevented from getting employment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is it necessary to introduce this legislation? Why is it necessary to make reference to a person's religion? As has been said by my right hon. Friend, we have had a sad experience of the past in Northern Ireland, of which Northern Ireland representatives are well aware. We know what has happened in the past. A series of commissions—not only the committee in which the hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee) played such an important role—appointed by the Government inquired fully into what was happening in Northern Ireland, and came to the conclusion that there was outright bigotted discrimination against people of a certain religious and political belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Northern Ireland the facts of life are that persons professing the Ronan Catholic religion are not in the majority supporters of the Ulster Unionist Party. Persons professing the Protestant religion—Unitarian, Presbytarian and Church of Ireland—are to a great extent supporters of a brand of Unionism. That is the clear-cut political divide, and that is what this debate is all about and the reason why this legislation is so necessary. I think that it should be put on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A commission set up by this Government and chaired by Lord Cameron carried out a painstaking inquiry to find out
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
whether it was right that people were being discriminated against because of their religion or the place of worship they attended on Sunday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 138 of the Cameron Report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are satisfied that all these Unionist controlled councils have used and use their power to make appointments in a way which benefited Protestants. In the figures available for October 1968 only 30 per cent. of Londonderry Corporation's administrative, clerical and technical employees were Catholics. Out of the ten best-paid posts only one was held by a Catholic. In Dungannon Urban District none of the Council's administrative, clerical and technical employees was a Catholic. In County Fermanagh no senior council posts (and relatively few others) were held by Catholics: this was rationalised by reference to "proven loyalty" as a necessary test for local authority appointments.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I appreciate that the theological debate must range rather widely, but I think the hon. Gentleman is making a "clause stand part" speech now. Perhaps if he could confine himself a little more strictly to the amendment it would help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Latham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Jeger. Like others, I am trying to judge whether the words "professed" or "supposed" in relation to religion are likely to be more effective. I was finding it helpful to have some examples of alleged discrimination in employment in Northern Ireland so that we might judge precisely whether the word "supposed" or "professed" would be more appropriate in trying to deal with the type of discrimination which my hon. Friend described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be quite in order if the hon. Member for Belfast. West (Mr. Fitt) would relate his interesting argument a little more directly to the amendments on the Order Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you very much, Mrs. Jeger. Perhaps I may conclude by quoting to the end of this paragraph:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In County Fermanagh no senior council posts (and relatively few other) were held by Catholics: this was rationalised by reference to 'proven loyalty' as a necessary test for local authority appointments. In that County, among about seventy-five drivers of school buses, at most seven were Catholics. This would appear to be a very clear case of sectarian and political discrimination. Armagh Urban District employed very few Catholics in its salaried posts, but did not appear to discriminate at lower
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
levels. Omagh Urban District Council showed no clear cut pattern of discrimination, though we have seen what would appear to be undoubted evidence of employment discrimination in Tyron County Council."</p></blockquote>
That is what this legislation is about. That is why religion has to be mentioned in this type of legislation. It is not because a person goes to a particular place of worship, but because in Northern Ireland it is assumed that his political support depends on whether he comes from one section of the community or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanation which has been given by my right hon. Friend very clearly defines what the Bill intends to do. It makes reference to a person's supposed belief or political belief. In Northern Ireland it is not necessary to go to Mass on a Sunday to prove that one is a Catholic and thereby prevent oneself from obtaining a job in a Protestant industrial concern. The argument can be advanced the other way round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in Northern Ireland, particularly the main employers of labour—the shipyards, the rope works, Shorts and Harlands—remain employers who have brought employment to the work force in their thousands. They are mostly run by people who give their support to a political party other than my own. This clause is nixed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is straying again. He must not discuss the clause—only the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to see the amendment in the Bill. I support its inclusion. But in effect we know that religion is a means of identifying one's political loyalties. No one knows this more clearly than Opposition Members who represent Northern Ireland constituencies. They are opposed to seeing this amendment become effective. I think otherwise, and I support the clause as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite the hon. Gentleman's difficulty in ascertaining whether he was speaking to an amendment or to the clause, I thought that what the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) had to say was very useful in illustrating the difficulties of definition which we must, as far as possible, get right. I acknowledge the great seriousness with which the right hon. Gentleman the Minister treated the necessity and the difficulty of obtaining a successful definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
Although we shall cone to Clause 57 later, it is hardly possible for us sensibly to discuss these amendments without reference to it. Therefore, perhaps I might make one minor point on Clause 57(2), and then a major one. As I read it, the term "supposed", though it qualifies religious belief, does not qualify the absence of religious belief. We seem to have given, as it were, the protection of the fluidity of supposition to those who are Roman Catholics or Protestants but not to atheists or agnostics. Perhaps before we get to Clause 57 the position and drafting, from that point of view, might be looked at, and that may well help my hon. Friend over his second point in relation to atheists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the distinction between "supposed" and "professed", the debate has brought us into confrontation between the wording we are struggling towards in the statute and the realities as people know them and live with them. We are still in difficulty with the word "supposed".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me take an imaginary case. A Roman Catholic, baptised and confirmed, has his first communion as a Roman Catholic. At the age of 25 he lapses and everyone knows that he has lapsed. There is no secret about the matter. There is no question of his being "supposed" to be of Roman Catholic persuasion. Nobody could justifiably suppose it. His employer does not suppose it, and nobody else supposes it. But—and here I come close to the hon. Member for Belfast, West—people say that that is not what they
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
mean. They are not really talking about that; they are talking about something else, and it has not altered that something else that that man does not go to mass and that he professes not to accept any of the doctrines of the Church into which he was baptised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So behind the terminology of religion there lies something different. Curiously enough, we shall not find that even political opinion, when we discuss it later, is the full definition of that something else. We are faced—and we must acknowledge that this is one of the difficulties of this kind of legislation—by the duality between division of religion, division of political opinion and other deeper and less accessible divisions, and we are trying to wrap those all up with a definition which, by its terminology, relates to religion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not escape from that problem with the term "supposed", as I think I have proved. The term "supposed" may throw it as wide open as another adjective. We have to find something which is sufficiently objective for the law to bite upon and for the courts, in the event of a case being carried right through, to give a decision upon that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My contention is that between Opposition and Government we have not solved the problem—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
