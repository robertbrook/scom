	<div class='member'>Dr. Gilbert</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft instrument.</p></blockquote>
This order amends the 1972 order with a similar title. Its operative Article is 3(
	<i>c</i>), whose effect will be to permit industrial establishments in Winsford at present receiving regional employment premium to continue to do so for a further year. Without the order payments would otherwise cease from 8th September this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are introducing the order because they take the view that, since we announced in the Budget Statement our decision to maintain the present arrangements for paying REP generally, while we review its future, it would be only equitable to do so for firms in the Winsford area. The order will extend the payments for one year. That will at least cover the period during which we are considering what future arrangements we want to make. I hope that my remarks will be adequate for the Committee's purposes. If there are any questions, I shall be happy to try to answer them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Redmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The urban district of Winsford ceased to exist under the Local Government Act. Therefore, the order should surely be amended to specify the new name of the district formerly known as Winsford Urban District? If we are to continue to use old local government boundaries in new legislation we shall find ourselves in a fearful muddle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Gilbert</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that it is not necessary to change the title of the (instrument, as suggested by the hon. Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Robert Redmond), but that the order meets the purpose intended by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly the broad question of the regional employment premium is one that could more appropriately be discussed on another occasion. We are concerned only with particular aspects of it in the Committee. But may I ask the Financial Secretary a question, in view of the answer he has just given? Are we to understand that the two areas are co-extensiveâ€”that is, that the old and the new local districts are the same?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Gilbert</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am informed that the areas are identical. To go into the history of the matter in a little more detail, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that until 1972 Winsford Urban District, although it was not in the Merseyside Development Area, took an overspill population from Merseyside. As a result of taking that overspill, the area benefited from the development area schemes. Section 15(6) of the Industrial Development Act 1966, now Section 1(5) of the Local Employment Act 1972, provides the necessary powers for the Government's action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By 1972, Winsford was down-graded to intermediate area status, but it was decided to continue payments of REP to firms that had already established themselves in the area, having done so with the expectation of getting the REP. There is no difference between the area covered by this order and previous arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT CALF SUBSIDIES (UNITED KINGDOM (VARIATION) (No. 2) SCHEME 1974</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.35 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft instrument.</p></blockquote>
It may be thought that there is little to say about this because of the variation proposed in the scheme, but I think that the Committee should have a brief explanation in view of the fact that there was another variation scheme a short time ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This variation scheme proposes to apply the Â£10 increase in subsidy rates which was recently approved for calves born in Great Britain to all calves born in the United Kingdom. In other words, this variation scheme provides for calves born in Northern Ireland to become eligible for the Â£10 increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason we are having to take two bites at this particular cherry is, I think, well known to Members of the Committee. Briefly, the original intention was to exclude calves born in Northern Ireland from the increase because, when the first variation scheme was drafted, a beef marketing subsidy, broadly equivalent in value to the Â£10 increase in the calf subsidy rates for calves born in Great Britain, was in operation in Northern Ireland; its purpose was to prevent distortion of trade across the Border as a result of the difference in the guide price in the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation has since changed. My right hon. Friend the Minister announced in the House on 19th June that, following agreement reached in the EEC Council of Ministers on 17th-18th June, the guide price in the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic was to be the same from 1st July: that in consequence the special subsidy in Northern Ireland would end on that date, and that, subject to parliamentary approval, the higher rate of calf subsidy would become payable in Northern Ireland. The proposed variation scheme gives effect to the last of these decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a few words about the way this second variation scheme is
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
drafted, since some concern was expressed about the drafting of the first variation scheme. I think that the position is easier to understand if one bears in mind that the principlal scheme relates to the United Kingdom as a whole and that it originally provided for uniform rates to apply to calves throughout the country. As the principal scheme applies to the United Kingdom, a scheme which varies it must necessarily do the same and be made by the same Ministers even if the variation affects only part of the country. In fact, the first variation scheme replaced two paragraphs of the principal scheme by paragraphs providing for higher rates in Great Britain and for lower rates in Northern Ireland. The intention in the second variation scheme is to remove the difference in rates as between Great Britain, on the one hand, and Northern Ireland, on the other, and legislate for a uniform rate throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this will sufficiently explain why the wording of the second variation scheme does not explicitly refer to an increase in subsidy rates in Northern Ireland. I can, of course, give an assurance that if the scheme is approved it will put Northern Ireland calves on exactly the same footing as calves in the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a full debate on the earlier variation scheme ranging over the beef industry as a whole; and the Minister has since informed the House, in the course of the Supply debate on agriculture on 26th June of his intention to press immediately for direct interim action to be taken, in recognition of the need to assure beef producers that their returns will not drop below about Â£18 a live cwt. for clean quality cattle. I cannot add to this at present, but against this background I confidently commend the draft scheme to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.39 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Minister for coming. Apart from Question Time, this is his baptism by fire in his present office. Although we congratulated him at Question Time last week, I hope it will not be out of order if I congratulate him again on his appointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I might offer the Minister some advice, which is a presumption in any case. If in future he could speak
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
more slowly we would be able to follow him. He went at a tremendous gallop through his brief and, as these are complicated matters, it would help us if he would not go so fast.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I followed what the Minister said. I have been concerned to read this variation scheme and to compare it with the first variation scheme which we debated in the House two weeks ago, which put up the calf subsidy by Â£10 a head for both heifers and/or calves. In the previous variation scheme the subsidy was increased by Â£10 a head only for calves born on or after 30th October 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the previous variation scheme on page 2, sub-paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) of the substituted paragraph 4 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the case of a calf born in England, Wales or Scotland on or after 30th October 1973 and certified for subsidy in any of those countries â€¦"</p></blockquote>
and it then goes on to explain what the rate is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, that paragraph is deleted from this variation scheme. Instead of sub-paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>) in the previous variation scheme, there are substituted sub-paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>) on page 2 of the scheme which we are discussing today. I have been looking to see how the new paragraph differs from the previous one. The proviso that the increased rates apply only to calves born on or after 30th October 1973 has been left out. That was the proviso to which we agreed in the House two weeks ago, and it has now been deleted. The increased subsidy of Â£10 per head will come into force tomorrow if we agree to this scheme today, and it will be paid for all calves which become eligible for the subsidy. Where in the previous scheme only calves born before that date were eligible, this scheme applies to all calves, previous not eligible for subsidy, which were born before 30th October last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the way I read the scheme. I have puzzled over it overnight, because I thought I must be wrong. The Explanatory Note of the scheme which we are discussing says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This scheme further varies the Calf Subsidies (United Kingdom) Scheme 1974 by extending the Â£10 increase in the rates of subsidy to certified calves born anywhere in the United Kingdom on or after 30th October 1973."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
That is what I understood the Government were trying to do. But according to this scheme, it seems that they are leaving out the only reference there has been in the series of calf schemes which refers to 30th October 1973. If I am wrong I will gladly give way to the Minister, but, as I understand it, we are now increasing the scope of the Â£10 increase to all calves which become eligible for subsidy from now on. If the Minister wishes to intervene I will gladly give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.44 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I should like to say that I appreciate the hon. Member's earlier remarks and I take note of them. It may help the hon. Member if I refer to the Explanatory Note on the back of the scheme, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This scheme further varies the Calf Subsidies (United Kingdom) Scheme 1974 by extending the Â£10 increase in the rates of subsidy to certified calves born anywhere in the United Kingdom on or after 30th October 1973."</p></blockquote>
On the matter which he raised, this may be a drafting point, as I understand that the reference to the date in paragraph 4(
	<i>a</i>) of the first scheme is unnecessary. Further, the principal scheme, as amended, refers explicitly only to calves born on or after 30th October 1973.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the principal scheme, as amended. This is the amendment which I have been looking at. It does not have a number on it. It is one of those which I had a copy before it was passed by the House two weeks ago. I understand that we are taking out that paragraph which amended the principal scheme. I am sorry to be tedious, but it is this paragraph which brought in 30th October 1973 in the first variation scheme and which, as I understand it, is the only reference we have had at any time to that date. We are by this scheme removing only that reference to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps there are some other schemes to which I do not have access, which do refer to 30th October, but I repeat that, as I understand it, we are, by this scheme, deleting all reference to 30th October 1973, and that if we pass it the extra Â£10 will be available to calves born before that date, which become eligible for certification at any time from now. Perhaps the Minister would like to consider that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister announced some weeks ago that he was going to increase the calf
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
subsidy by Â£10. As the Committee will know, we on this side of the Committee have criticised the Government over their handling of the beef situation. It is no bad thing to look at what has happened over calf slaughterings during the last few weeks. We are told that the Government have tried to cut down the number of calves being slaughtered and that they seem not to have been particularly aware of the problems of the beef industry until very recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking the Government's figures for calf slaughtering we see that in the week beginning 1st June 3,500 calves were slaughtered; in the following week, 8th June, 5,000 were slaughtered; in the following week, 15th June, 5,900 were slaughtered, and in the final week, ending 22nd June, 6,300 were slaughtered. So there has been a dramatic increase from 3,500 to 6,300 in the course of those three or four weeks in June, during which time the Minister made his announcement about increasing the calf subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that this action of increasing the subsidy by Â£10 has clearly not been enough and shows that the Government's policy has been woefully inadequate. The increase in the calf slaughtering figures show this to be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the Northern Ireland situation, which I gathered was the main purpose of this scheme. I understand how it is that, because the guide price for beef has now been harmonised between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, it was felt that there was no longer any need to have Northern Ireland in a different position from the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Â£1Â·76 subsidy per cwt. on cattle exported from Irelandâ€”either from Northern Ireland or the Republicâ€”to this country, which ended on 1st July, caused considerable chaos last week in certain livestock markets in the North of England. In parts of North Yorkshire there had been a great many fat cattle purchased during the last week in markets in Northern Ireland to be resold in markets in the North of England. In some of those markets there were anything between 50 and 80 cattle which had been brought straight over from Northern Ireland. I heard of one dealer who had brought over 200 cattle during the course of that week. He had presumably drawn an export subsidy of about Â£20 a head
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
which, for 200 cattle, amounts to Â£4,000, and sold the cattle in the last week's rather buoyant markets which followed the Minister's announcement of the base of Â£18 per cwt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one effect of changing these matters, which has caused a needless opportunity for certain people to cash in on the arrangements. But the Minister has carefully and eloquently explained why the arrangements between Northern Ireland and Great Britain have had to be changed, and because of the harmonisation of the guide price between the Republic and Northern Ireland it has been found no longer necessary to have these special arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of the next few weeks, however, we shall be back to exactly the same situation which the Minister has told us this morning has been remedied. Instead of having a different guide price between Northern Ireland and the Republic, which has been equalised, in the future we shall have a situation throughout the United Kingdom in which the Â£18 per cwt. base will be operating, whereas in the Republic that Â£18 will not be operating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it was logical to harmonise the calf subsidy after the guide price had been harmonised, what will happen to the calf subsidy after the Â£18 base is introduced within the next few weeks? That will put an imbalance back into the beef market between Northern Ireland and the Republic. It may be that the Minister will have to ask, within the next few weeks, for yet another calf subsidy variation orderâ€”to change it one way or the other, up or downâ€”but is that in the Minister's mind? Will he tell the Committee what provisions will be made when the Â£18 base is introduced to deal with this imbalance, with the possibility of cattle being brought over the border from one part of Ireland to the other, wherever the financial tide happens to suit best?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are questions which I hope the Minister will answer, but the most important question concerns the base date of 30th October 1973. Without wishing to be tedious, I repeat that it will mean that in future all calves, whether born before or after 30th October 1973, will qualify for the increased subsidy of Â£10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) has not been tedious and he had a right, which he chose to exercise, to raise the points he did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To clarify the date of 30th October I should refer the hon. Member to the Principal Schemeâ€”1974 No. 630. It states clearly in Part I, paragraph 6:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A calf to which this part of the scheme applies to calf whichâ€”</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(
	<i>a</i>) was born in the United Kingdom within the period beginning with 30th October 1973 â€¦"</p></blockquote>
That has not been amended, so that applies in the variation schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member has raised one or two points about the future of calf slaughterings. He has queried the confidence in the future of the beef market and made other observations about Northern Ireland, which I shall briefly try to deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first matter is the effect on the market of various announcements. One must look at the action taken by the Government. To safeguard future production, the first need that my right hon. Friend had to take into account was to assist breeders and rearers. For this purpose, the suggestion is that the calf sub-
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
sidy should be raised by Â£10 a head from 1st July, more than double the previous rate. The rates are under discussion this morning. This will bring the total support for beef producers to Â£100 million a year, equivalent to Â£2Â·50 per live cwt. The help thus provided should work through to all members of the industry. This takes time, but hon. Members can be assured that the Government have the matter under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member refers to the possibility of more variation schemes, but I cannot comment. I think he would expect us to keep the situation of the beef industry, which is changing daily with EEC complications, under constant review. I assure him that we shall bring forward any measures that we consider necessary to deal with that and to retain confidence in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the effect of slaughtering levels on future production, during the first six months of this year, slaughterings of cows and calves were higher than in the corresponding period last yearâ€”as the hon. Member impliedâ€”cows and bulls by about a third and calves more than doubled. But comparison with last year is misleading, because slaughterings in the last two years were unusually low. Several factors would explain that. The national herd has expanded rapidly over the last few years; the herd contains many older cows as a result of last year's retentions for breeding, and many producers held back stock last autumn in the expectation of higher prices. We believe that the current level of slaughterings is not unduly high and does not suggest that future production will be adversely affected. We need an assurance of the future for the industry and the recent moves, as evidenced by the orders before the House, show that we are keeping the matter under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, may I say a word about the Northern Ireland position in relation to the variation in the guide prices? The hon. Member may be aware that, in order to maintain the competitiveness of production and processing on either side of the Irish border, despite different guide prices, alternative arrangements to the Â£10 increase in the calf subsidy were made for Northern Ireland producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the alignment of our guide price with the Irish Republic on 1st July, payments under the beef marketing scheme
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
have ceased and, instead, the increase of Â£10 per head will apply. This represents a slightly lower overall return and is injected at an early stage of the pro- duction chain instead of at the point of slaughter. Northern Ireland producers will benefit from a stronger market as a result of the guide price increase and they had no guarantee that payments would be guaranteed at a level of Â£1Â·76 per live cwt. for the duration of the beef marketing scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Northern Ireland producers fear that the existence of intervention in the Republic will attract cattle across the Border, unless the Northern Ireland market is underpinned to ensure a producer price competitive with the intervention price in the Republic. It will be accepted that the need is for this scheme now before us to be introduced as quickly as possible and that there should be a higher premium in Northern Ireland to offset their usually lower market returns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt with the main points raised by the hon. Member and I therefore commend the measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry West</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of this matter, but I still see a lot of merit in what my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) has been saying about the confusion that has existed in the publication of this document. I fully appreciate the point that he made earlier about the mention that was made of the date of the 30th October 1973 in the principal scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Being a new boy on these matters of draft statutory instruments, I still feel it is strange that these things were mentioned in the Explanatory Note on the back. In this note it has been made clear that it is not part of the scheme, but nevertheless these dates were mentioned. It is still confusing to me and to my colleagues in Northern Ireland how the Northern Ireland people fit into this scheme. We had a debate in the House the other day and expressed our concern about the confusion that this scheme has created, because in some parts of this scheme England, Scotland and Wales are mentioned and the Explanatory Note refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"calves born anywhere in the United Kingdom."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
The use of the different terms is confusing to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned, too, about Part II of the scheme. This is the section that deals with the subsidy paid on carcases. Possibly most members of the Committee know that there are occasions in which cattle are slaughtered which have not, for one reason or another, earned the subsidy, and they can earn this subsidy in the carcase form. The Explanatory Note relates:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The scheme also extends the fixed rates of subsidy of Â£16Â·50 and Â£18Â·50 respectively for heifer and male carcases certified on or after 16th December 1974 to the carcases of animals born anywhere in the United Kingdom "â€”</p></blockquote>
and that to me means Northern Ireland too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was made earlier to the way in which this subsidy was arranged for Northern Ireland in order not to distort trade between Northern Ireland and Eire. It was the original intention that the Â£10 subsidy should apply throughout the United Kingdom, but when it came to the notice of the Ministry about the possibility of distorting trade between Eire and Northern Ireland the figure of Â£1Â·76 was introduced to be paid in Northern Ireland in lieu of the Â£10 calf subsidy. When the Minister announced this arrangement peculiar to Northern Ireland, the impression was given that that arrangement would last at least until January 1975. Farmers in Northern Ireland were concerned about the sudden change in policy, which I am aware was brought about by circumstances possibly outside the control of the Minister. Farmers in Northern Ireland were concerned that the Â£1Â·76 that had been given for a period of up to January 1975 had been altered within three months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a serious matter that many livestock producers bought what we call store cattle. These are potential beef animals. They bought these store cattle in the spring of this year on the understanding that that Â£1Â·76 would be paid to them when the cattle were marketed again as beef animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That system has now been changed and those producers would appear to be at a loss if Part II of the scheme is enforced too rigidly. The farmers and graziers who bought such store animals in the spring of this year on the understanding that this Â£1Â·76 would be paid
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
will not receive the increase in the calf subsidy if marketed before 16th December in carcase form. I should like the Minister to look at the matter again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am as concerned as my hon. Friend about the waste of resources in this form of slaughtering of calves throughout the United Kingdom. This is a resource which we can ill-afford to lose. From my own experience as a practical farmer, I believe that the calf subsidy, welcome though it is, is not the complete answer for halting the slaughter of calves. This will have a severe impact on the national order in the future. As we all know, if there is not sufficient livestock in the country to satisfy the demands of the beef producers who are producing beef in the national interest, then beef will have to be bought from outside sources, supplies will be scarce, prices will rocket, and the cost of living will shoot up again. I firmly believe that this situation can be arrested by more encouragement to producers of the end product, rather than more and more injections in the calf subsidy stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have every sympathy with the man who rears the calf. I rear calves myself. I know the difficulties and the expenses connected with the rearing of calves. But, looking at the overall picture and trying to rule out any selfish interest that I may have, I believe that the best way to stimulate the rearing of calves is to encourage a higher price for the end product. If the slaughtering of calves continues at the present rate, we shall see a scarcity and an increase in the price of beef to the consumer throughout the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it was very welcome news that the Minister had endeavoured to put a bottom in the market with the introduction of Â£18 as a base, there is concern, in Northern Ireland in particular, about the calculations leading up to the base of Â£18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, while the price of beef animals in Britain is in excess of Â£18, it is as low as Â£14 per cwt. in Northern Ireland. In making his calculations to bring the price to the producer up to the base of Â£18, the Minister has first to assess the market price on average. This is the big issue: if he takes the average of the United Kingdom as a whole, bearing in mind that the producer here is
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
receiving about Â£4 per cwt. more than the producer in Northern Ireland, in order to put a floor in the market as I have mentioned, the Northern Ireland producer will always be below the average and will fair badly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A precedent was established when intervention was in force that the region of Northern Ireland was treated as a separate entity for the purpose of calculation for intervention. I want to make a strong plea to the Minister that it is imperative to the welfare of the livestock producers of Northern Ireland that Northern Ireland be treated as a separate region for the purpose of taking the average market price to build up to the figure of Â£18 which he has mentioned. I hope that the Minister will bring this to the notice of his senior colleagueâ€”I have already done so myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I have made the position clear. I am still greatly concerned about the slaughter of calves, and I speak in the national interest generally. Beef producers have had a severe shock with the peculiar market conditions in the immediate past, and we seem to be getting over it gradually. But much still needs to be done to restore confidence in this country's beef production.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will seek to deal briefly with some of the points raised by the right hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. West). I understand his particular interest in Northern Ireland; I am talking not of his commercial interest but of the representative role that he plays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the variation schemes, I agree that there may be some confusion because of the way in which they were carried out, but I think it would help the Committee if I were to comment briefly on some of the reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreement for the Â£10 subsidy rate increase for calves in Great Britain was obtained in March, and the first variation scheme implementing it was laid before Parliament on 10th June. It was not until one week laterâ€”17th Juneâ€”that agreement was obtained in the Council of Ministers to the Â£10 increase for Northern Ireland. To have withdrawn the first scheme and substituted a single consolidated scheme, which some hon. Members may have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
thought preferable, would have meant delays, with the result that the higher prices could not have been effective in Britain on 1st July, when the first calves eligible for the Â£10 increase reached the minimum age of certificationâ€”which is eight months. Records are being kept of the relatively few Northern Ireland calves likely to come forward for certification at this time of the year, and, assuming that the scheme comes into operation, the Ministry of Agriculture will be able to identify the calves concerned so that they benefit from the increased rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that explanation clears the confusion which may have arisen over the way in which this matter was dealt with. I feel that it was probably inevitable and necessary in the interests of getting the scheme operative in some respects as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have much to add to the right hon. Member's comments on the slaughtering of calves, etc. I have already referred to the hon. Member for Westmorland on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. Gentleman can express a little concern about the level of calf slaughtering to which my right hon. Friend referred. This is very alarming to us, and when the hon. Gentleman referred to it earlier, after my own remarks, he spoke of the possibility of approximately doubling the rate of slaughter of calves. That may well be a figure that he has concocted from the six-month averages, but perhaps he would be good enough to look at the figures for calf slaughterings in the last week I mentionedâ€”the week ending 22nd Juneâ€”when 6Â·3 thousand calves were slaughtered compared with only 1Â·4 thousand the year before. That is an increase of something between 4,000 and 5,000, and is an increase in scale far beyond the one referred to by the hon. Gentleman earlier, and I hope that he will express more concern and more dynamism in trying to stem this tragic slaughter. There is no use in saying that there was a low level of slaughter last year. It was not all that low. It is now terrifyingly high, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will say a little more about my right hon. Friend's remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I need go through the recent history of calves and
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
beef generally. Hon. Members will be well aware of the enormous rise in the cost of feeding stuffs at the end of last year, and this year as well, and the uncertainties because of the EEC relationship, which is another factor partly responsible for the way in which we have had to introduce these variation schemes. We had to get EEC approval before the Â£10 subsidy could come into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am bound to express concern about calf slaughterings. We must all do so, but this is only part of the problem, which can only be solved by giving the market more confidence. I have outlined briefly this morning some of the measures taken by my right hon. Friend to give more confidence in future. What we are considering today is designed as only a part of those measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give the Committee an assurance that we are keeping the position under reviewâ€”particularly the position in Northern Ireland. As Northern Ireland, by virtue of this instrument, is coming into the United Kingdom scheme, it will be necessary to watch the position there vis-Â°-vis the position in the Irish Republic, to ensure that some of the problems raised by the hon. Member will not materialise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding store cattle, the point was made that Â£14 in Northern Ireland was the market price. The hon. Gentleman has made the point about the position of store cattle, and this may be one of the anomalies which is bound to arise on measures of this sort. Obviously, instruments of this sort have been framed in such a way as to ensure that the majority benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Morrison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman quite rightly stressed his concern in the light of what my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) said about the calf slaughtering, and he said that he and his colleagues are determined to try to renew confidence in beef production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The calf slaughterings to which the hon. Gentleman referred do not take account of the announcement made by the Minister recently about the Â£18 base price. We do not know what effect that Â£18 will have in connection with calf slaughtering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's point about the end price is important. Can we take it,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
in the light of what the hon. Gentleman has said today, that if the calf subsidy increase, coupled with the Â£18 base, does not have the effect of reversing this trend in calf slaughterings, the Minister of Agriculture will come back and make a further announcement aimed at securing greater confidence in the industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think one can give that assurance. We shall watch the position carefully. When discussing the beginning of a scheme of this sort, clearly one has to watch the situation carefully to see what the trend is and what other action will be necessary to deal with it. I have made the point that, as a result of this measure, the total support for a beef producer will rise to Â£100 million per yearâ€”the equivalent of Â£2Â·50 per live cwt. This is a step in the right direction to deal with the problems which have been raised this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the Northern Ireland position reference was made to Part II of the scheme which, of course, comes into stage Bâ€”the carcase aspect. Calves born anywhere in the United Kingdom on or after the 30th October 1973 and certified liveâ€”that is stage Aâ€”will, until further notice, be paid a subsidy of Â£18.50 if male, or Â£16Â·50 if female.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When carcases are presented for certification at stage B, the effect of the variation scheme will be that carcases certified anywhere in the United Kingdom on or after the 16th December next will, until further notice, be entitled to the same increased rates of subsidy. The cost of applying the increased rates in Northern Ireland will be about Â£5 million per year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I have dealt with all the questions raised, possibly not all satisfactorily, but I assure the Committee that the matter will be kept very much under review and my right hon. Friend will not hesitate to take other action necessary to retain confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. West</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will remember the concern expressed with regard to the calf slaughterings and that the high figure for the month of June quoted by my hon. Friend gives great cause for alarm. As those of us with practical experience of the workings of the farmers throughout the country know, generally speaking, milk is at a low price
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
during mid-summer and that is the time when farmers tend to concentrate more on the rearing of calves, particularly on the dairy farms, whereas, when milk is at a high price in the winter, the farmers ease off and tend to sell more calves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this rate of slaughtering goes on throughout the expensive period for rearing calves, I am afraid that the slaughtering rates will be much higher unless something is done, and this is why I pinpoint this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to Northern Ireland, I said earlier that the Minister's announcement of Â£1Â·76 per cwt. for cattle in Northern Ireland gave the impression that this scheme would last to January 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The announcement was made in regard to cattle throughout the United Kingdom, and the Minister has said that this will not be implemented until he has the certification machinery established. Naturally, if I know the farmersâ€”I know my inclinations, tooâ€”they are tending to hold up the stock for marketing until this new scheme comes into operation after the certification machinery has been set up. There will be many farmers throughout the United Kingdom who will hold up the sale of their cattle until the better market price comes into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This will present again a tremendous glut on the market, a further depression in price, and a great cost to the Treasury. The Minister has said in the House, and to me personally, that he must talk further with members of the European Economic Commission about this new scheme. I would hazard a guess that the Minister would not have been prepared to put his head on the chopper, as it were, in announcing this scheme in the House if he had not a fairly good assurance that the scheme would be accepted by the Commissioners in the EEC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that no time will be lost in setting up this machinery, in order that the scheme can be implemented at the earliest opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another plea I make on behalf of my fellow farmers in Northern Ireland is that, as we have the certification machinery in being, ready to put into operation, and now that we have lost the Â£1Â·76â€”and the farmers are disappointed, having bought cattle on the understanding that they would get the benefit of it when marketing the cattleâ€”I believe that a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
strong case exists for the early implementation of the scheme. There will be no delay in Northern Ireland in establishing the certification machinery, which, as I have said, is already in being.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to impress upon his right hon. Friend the needâ€”not only for the benefit of the farmers of Northern Irelandâ€”to reduce the burden of expenditure that will undoubtedly fall upon the Treasury whenever the market is glutted, on the introduction of this scheme through cattle being held up for that period of marketing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Member for his further comments on the increased slaughterings in recent months. It can be said that the increased slaughterings in June were at a time of depressed market prices, but, as I pointed out, the Minister made his statement in the Supply debate on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
26th June, and I think that this gave a new measure of confidence to the industry. I hope that this will result in fewer slaughterings in the immediate future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I share the hon. Member's concern on this matter and I assure him that we will keep the position under review. Although I am not a producer, I have over 80 villages in my constituency. I am very much in touch with the farming community through the NFU; we have a good relationship with them, and we are never unaware of the problems facing the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
