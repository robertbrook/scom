	<p>[
	<i>Relevant Documents: European Union Document No. 9431/00, Special Report No. 11/2000 of the Court of Auditors on the support scheme for olive oil and European Union Document No. 5213/01, a Commission report on the quality strategy for olive oil and a draft Council regulation relating to the aid scheme and the quality strategy for olive oil.</i>]</p>

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Ms Joyce Quin)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This issue is complex and refers to an area of the common agricultural policy of which the United Kingdom does not have direct experience; we do not have olive oil producers and do not operate an olive oil regime. However, proposals have been made for reform of the sector and we take a keen interest in reform of all CAP issues. The Committee's views on the shape of the regime will be helpful to the Government in approaching those opportunities in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee wanted the opportunity to debate the Court of Auditors' special report on the support scheme for olive oil, and I understand that desire because the report paints an unfortunate picture of irregularities and lack of financial controls in the olive oil sector. However, the report covers the aid scheme prior to the 1998 reform of the regime and concentrates on two elements that were particularly prone to irregularities and fraud: consumption aid and export refunds. The interim reform of the olive oil regime, which was agreed under the United Kingdom presidency in 1998, discontinued the consumption aid scheme from 1 November that year. That reform retained export refunds in theory, but the Committee will be interested to know that for more than two years the Commission has pursued a policy of setting them at zero, on the basis that exports have been taking place without export refunds. Indeed, exports are at record levels, so the re-introduction of export refunds, which have caused problems, is now looking less and less likely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1998 reform also introduced single flat rate production aid, which was set for three years, national guaranteed quantity allocations, an enhanced private storage aid system to replace intervention, and the important requirement for a geographic information system—GIS—to replace the olive cultivation register. It also restricted eligibility to claim aid on new trees and charged the Commission with presenting fundamental reform proposals by the end of 2000. The reform was a transitional measure and reflected the Council of Ministers' wish to focus checks on
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
production aid, with olive mills seen as the essential link in the production chain and therefore an important element to target in terms of financial controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1998 reforms originated in an options paper introduced for discussion by the European Commission. Among other things, the paper suggested two alternatives for producer aid. Those were either to continue to pay the aid according to the tonnage of olive oil produced, or to start paying it according to the number or area of productive olive trees cultivated by a producer. The Commission noted that either system would require rigorous checks, and proposed that it should be linked to a new GIS-based register. The Commission did not consider that it was in a position yet to decide between the two alternatives. It therefore proposed that the interim regime should apply for three years and that, during that period, GIS-based registers should be introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1998 reform package required the Commission to produce a report on further reform of the olive oil regime by the end of 2000, with proposals for the regime that should apply from November 2001. The intention was that the Council would make a definitive decision on whether production aid should be paid on the basis of tonnage or of number of trees. The Commission report is in Council document 5213/01, which is one of the documents marked relevant to this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the report contains a useful analysis of the workings of the interim regime, the Commission has concluded that it does not yet have sufficient information to decide between the two alternative options. It has, therefore, proposed that the interim regime should be extended for a further two years. Although the Government are disappointed at that outcome, we accept the reasons behind the extension. We look forward to more far-reaching reform from 1 November 2003, and will vigorously oppose any requests for a longer extension of the current arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, one element of the Commission proposals that we particularly welcome. The Commission has proposed that, from November 2003, the Council should adopt a provision limiting production aid to olive oil produced from trees covered by an operational olive cultivation GIS. We strongly support the proposal that the Council and all member states should commit themselves to linking producer aid under the new regime to GIS-based controls. We see GIS as one of the cornerstones of control of the regime. It ties in with the Court of Auditors' report, which recognises that a satisfactory olive cultivation register is an essential tool for the effective enforcement of whatever system is chosen for the payment of aid. Frustration and lack of certainty surrounding the number of olive groves and olive trees have caused many of the problems that have been identified in previous reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The GIS controls will be based on new crop declarations and computerised processing of aerial photographs. The GIS has still not been completed by any member state. The proposed restriction of aid paid
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
under the scheme is a strong incentive for renewed efforts to introduce the required GIS and to have it verified. Italy, Spain, France and Portugal now expect to have GIS in place this year. Greece is making efforts to beat the November 2003 deadline. Currently, if a particular GIS is not fully operational, member states are required to make on-the-spot inspections of up to 10 per cent. of all crop declarations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I do not need to remind the Committee of the Government's desire that all possible measures are taken to eliminate fraud in the olive oil regime. That desire is shared by the Commission and other member states. I assure the Committee that great efforts are being made to combat fraud in this sector. The 1998 transitional reform brought an end to consumption aid, which was shown to be ripe for large scale, organised fraud. Control measures have concentrated on checks at mills since the reform, and 30 per cent. of mills are inspected every year. That is a very high proportion given that there are nearly 12,000 mills, and shows the considerable efforts made to eliminate fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the end of last year, when the Committee expressed interest in debating the Court of Auditors' report, discussions have been progressing in the Commission on further ways of strengthening controls in the sector. That is in direct response to the Court of Auditors' report and with the knowledge gained from two years' working experience of the control measures introduced by the 1998 reform. The Commission's ideas on strengthening controls were discussed in the EU experts group on olive oil. Those discussions culminated in a proposal for adjustments to the current control system and the introduction of supplementary measures to apply from this marketing year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A proposal to amend the detailed rules for the application of the system of production aid was agreed on 14 March. The new system will improve fraud control in the sector in several ways. Infringements leading to enforcement of special control arrangements for mills have been clarified. Olive oil mills suspected of committing fraud will now be required to submit information on their milling activities on a daily basis. That is an onerous requirement, but deliberately so. The rationale for it is that daily transmission of figures to the Commission makes it much more difficult for mill operators to submit false returns or claim production aid to which they are not entitled. The Commission is determined to take an all-or-nothing approach to prove whether a mill is trying to massage its returns, and to reduce and discourage fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new regulation also sets out the criteria requiring individual member states to take steps to penalise infringements of the aid regime. It provides definitions to ensure standardised implementation of the rules by member states and for advance payments of aid to be deferred to allow additional checks on mills under suspicion of fraudulent activity. All those provisions are steps in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
There is also the important question of recovery action by member states. The Court of Auditors commented on the incompleteness of data on the amounts to be recovered, and delays in the recovery procedure for consumption aid. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food officials asked the Commission's European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund clearance of accounts service about progress in that area. They were advised that member states now provide the Commission with details of their debtors' registers every six months. From the EAGGF financial year 2000, those registers are also subject to audit by the certifying bodies of each paying agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The message from all that activity is that significant efforts are being made towards improving clearance of accounts. That started in 1995 with the introduction of formally accredited paying agencies. The inquiry into the management of debts continues in the current year, with follow-up of paying agencies already visited and audits at several other paying agencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is to be asked to support the Government's objective of pressing for further reform of the olive oil regime to reduce its cost, complexity and opportunity for fraud. The developments that I have described will certainly contribute to that, but there is still a long way to go before we can declare a satisfactory state in the sector. We will therefore continue to take every opportunity to urge the Commission and other member states to adopt further reform measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call hon. Members to ask questions, may I tell the Minister that the opening statement should not normally last longer than 10 minutes? Having said that, few hon. Members are present, so I have used my discretion. We now have until 11.30 am at the latest for questions to be put to the Minister on the matter and on her statement. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for all hon. Members to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Paice 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I preface my question by telling the Minister that I know that she has far more important things to deal with at present, and I have no intention of keeping her here longer than necessary. Her opening statement may prove the longest part of our proceedings. However, I have a couple of questions that I should like to ask, subject to catching your eye, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first question relates to the general agreement on tariffs and trade and the world trade talks. The Minister referred to the export refund issue, but even the Commission's new proposals are clearly production subsidies, which are against the spirit of GATT and the World Trade Organisation. What is the Government position on how to reform the olive oil regime so that it is compliant with GATT requirements, bearing in mind that most other sectors of CAP have moved away from production support?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question is important. The likely timetable for discussions in the GATT framework fits in with the likely timetable for discussions on further reform of the olive oil sector. The Government would like the aid that is eventually given to the olive oil sector to be compatible both with the GATT system and with the thrust of other reforms in agriculture that we have supported. In other words, we would move towards a system of direct aid for producers, in which that aid would be digressive over time—something that both the current Government and the previous Government favoured—and would in future be decoupled from production as far as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that getting agreement in the European Union for that will be challenging, to put it mildly, as several member countries benefit from the way that the olive oil regime has worked over the years. They are reluctant to see that support diminish. However, it will be possible— but not easy— to obtain that agreement if we can find a means of helping producers, both in the transitional sense and, while recognising their financial difficulties, in a way that sends them a clear signal about moving towards GATT compatibility and the principles of the reform of CAP, which we all support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ian Gibson
	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Norwich, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not delay proceedings either, but I am concerned about the word "fraud"—whenever I hear it, my hackles rise. My concern is health and oils. I recall many tragedies in Spain caused by oils and their effects on human health. European Union document 5213/01, which has been distributed to us, mentions types of fraud by mixing different oils. What does the Minister intend to say about
	<br><blockquote><p>"the lack of an analysis method for detecting this type of fraud (deodorising virgin oils)"</p></blockquote>
where different oils are mixed and there is no tracer for the contamination oil? Whose responsibility is it to ensure that any oil mixed is safe for human health?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of authorities are involved in the process. Each member state has its own arrangements for protecting the food chain and for ensuring that products that enter it are safe. That process is organised in a number of ways. However, in order for the regime to function properly, the European Commission has a responsibility to examine the systems in each member state to determine how far they protect European consumers and European taxpayers. The European anti-fraud office and the budgetary services in the European Commission have a role to play in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I envisage that, once it is established, the European food authority will also have a role. It is intended that it will monitor and co-ordinate the activities of the food safety agencies in the different countries as well as overseeing European food safety standards. The answer to my hon. Friend is that there is a variety of agencies involved. He is right to look more closely at the term "fraud". It covers a variety of activities. Those he mentioned are serious not only because they involve financial irregularities but because they are a threat to human health. It is true that some of the activities
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
categorised as fraud in the various reports constitute less serious irregularities, including overpayments or underpayments, which result from administrative error, so we must carefully consider what is meant by fraud. However, my hon. Friend highlights some of the most serious issues with which we must deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heath 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Somerton and Frome)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whose responsibility is the verification of the geographical information system? Is it a matter for member states and their authorities or is there a European body that can intervene if the arrangements made by any member state are found wanting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although responsibility for introducing the system lies with member states—they have undertaken to introduce the system by the deadline that I mentioned in my opening remarks—the information is supplied to the Commission. The Commission and Court of Auditors will then check whether the system is correctly administered and whether the claims for aid that are made for introducing the system are in order. Follow-up action is possible both through the anti-fraud office, OLAF, and through the Court of Auditors. Of course, member states can also be taken to the European Court of Justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister want to respond further, bearing in mind the note that I know she has not had time to read?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No thanks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we can encourage the Minister to say all that she needs to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return to the issue of fraud, raised by the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) and, in particular, to the horrifying figures in the report, which indicate a low level of recovery of money obtained by fraud. The figure for consumption aid amounts to 756 million euros, which is roughly £500,000, of which only 6 per cent.—a minuscule amount—has been recovered. Although irregularities on export refunds are lower, there is still only a 13 per cent. recovery rate. Those are large sums of money, and the failure of the Commission or national Governments to recover money that has been fraudulently obtained is serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who is responsible for recovering that money— national Governments or the Commission, through the European Court of Justice? What options are available? I see that the principal fault lies with Italy, but can national Governments be held accountable and required to return the money to the Commission's coffers, into which the UK puts a considerable amount of funding? Is it left to Governments to decide whether to reclaim the money from the producers who obtained it fraudulently, or must it be recovered from individual producers, which is a much tougher assignment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that there is massive concern about the failure to recover money that has been paid out unjustifiably as a result of fraudulent claims. A reform, dating back to 1995, of the clearance of accounts in the European Union introduced a system whereby the Commission requested member states to record all debts owed to the EAGGF, which represents the main CAP expenditure, in a debtors' ledger. Because of the difficulty in recovering debts, the Commission allowed up to eight years for debt recovery by a member state, after which it would refer most outstanding cases to the recently established OLAF. OLAF would then consider the reasons for the failure to recover the debt, and decide whether the debt should be charged to the Community budget or the member state's budget. That would depend on whether the failure was due to the member state's failure to act speedily and expeditiously or inability to determine what went wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an improvement in debt recovery. Greece recovers an increasing sum—more than 70 per cent.— and similar figures are now registered in Spain and Portugal. The Italian figure is low, which is partly a reflection of the slow and cumbersome legal process in Italy. We hope that that figure will improve. If it does not, OIAF will be able to take some recovery mechanisms from the member states under the system that I outlined, based on the reforms introduced in 1995.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heath</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a little difficult for many Members to understand why the rate of recovery is so very low, given that olive trees tend not to move around a great deal, even in Calabria. They are fairly static, and so are identifiable assets. I understand that the accredited paying agencies had initial responsibility for drawing up the debtors' register. Has any agency lost its accreditation as a result of not performing sufficiently well in the recovery of debt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the first point, the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood a key element of the matter. The fraud and difficulties of recovery about which we have talked relate to consumption aid—the aid paid to mills—not to individual producers. Therefore, they are not related to the number of olive trees. The Commission rightly decided that the consumption mechanism was fraud-friendly, and that is what it has removed. There will be on-going production aid but, if GIS is effective, as we believe it will be, controls on production aid will be far more satisfactory than those on consumption aid. The consumption aid system accounted for by far the greatest bulk of financial irregularities. It is important that the hon. Gentleman understands that. We believe that the elimination of consumption aid severely lessens the opportunities for fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly do not know of any example in which accreditation has been removed from a paying agency. If I am wrong, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman. The Commission seeks much greater ability, through the controls that it has implemented, to monitor and
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
inspect the work of paying agencies. That will enable it to ensure that they carry out their functions effectively and honestly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hastings and Rye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following on the theme of fraud, why is there no procedure on the strict liability of member states? Member states such as the UK have an obligation to enforce compliance and they benefit from fraud, indirectly. Is there a way, other than the complex procedure that the Minister has described, of establishing the strict liability of the state that has received the benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is no. I described in my opening statement the control arrangements in this sector. For other sectors of the CAP, there is a system of disallowance for dealing with financial irregularities. The UK even suffers from that system where, for whatever reason, aid has not been paid out correctly, or producers have claimed in a way that is not in accordance with the strict rules, even when they may have done so completely honestly without any intention to defraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the current outbreak of foot and mouth disease, my ministerial mailbag was full of letters from Members of Parliament about problems that individual farmers in their constituencies have had in submitting applications for aid under EU rules. Farmers have been filling in forms incorrectly and finding that they were subject to penalties as a result. When member states fail to apply the rules correctly, they may have to make a disallowance payment, which can be a sizeable sum. When producers fill in returns incorrectly, they find that either they do not get the payment that they were hoping for, or that that payment is proportionately reduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aldershot)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister for not being present at the outset of her remarks. Like my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice), I recognise that she has great responsibility for dealing with the foot and mouth problem, so I will be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall continue on the theme of how to tackle fraud, which was drawn to the Minister's attention by my hon. Friend. We are here in Committee as a result of the European Scrutiny Committee's deliberations. Although the Minister described the matter as disturbing, the Committee took the view that it was little short of a scandal. There is a huge amount of European taxpayers' money involved—£1.36 billion. As net contributors to the European budget, the United Kingdom perhaps has more of an interest in these matters than other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted the Minister's remarks to the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster) and others about the need to recover these funds, and the mechanisms for so doing. I put it to the Minister that the current arrangements do not seem to be working, particularly in the case of the Italians. I used to be an international banker, and I am well aware of the number of separate accounts that Italian companies maintain: one for the

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
taxman, showing no profit at all, one for the shareholders, showing a profit and one for some other organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the difficulties with Italy. However, the Minister has an opportunity, in intergovernmental meetings with her EU counterparts, to make it clear that the British people vigorously object to such activity. Perhaps she can convey a message from this Committee, which is following on from the work of the Scrutiny Committee, that the House, on behalf of the people of this country, takes an extremely dim view of the way that the Italians have dealt with the matter and that she, on our behalf, is looking to the Italian Government to be much more robust in dealing with clearly unacceptable fraud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly would not quarrel with the hon. Gentleman's comments. There are many aspects of the operation of the common agricultural policy that many of us would regard as disturbing or more than disturbing. We have had problems in the olive oil sector. Hon. Members are, quite rightly, equally disturbed about tobacco subsidies. We do not support the subsidies, and we strongly oppose many other aspects of the operation of the CAP. None the less, because the hon. Gentleman missed my opening speech, he missed my saying that the two factors of the regime that the report says are particularly mismanaged have now been changed: the regimes for consumption aid and for export refunds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report paints a highly disturbing picture, but it is historical. It lists some on-going problems, particularly on the valid question of recovery to which the hon. Gentleman rightly referred. The last thing that I want is to sound complacent on such a serious matter, but the recent establishment of OLAF and the proposals that the Commission is now putting in place to control production in the olive oil sector will bring about a considerable improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 9431/00, Special Report No. 11/2000 of the Court of Auditors on the support scheme for olive oil; and supports the Government's aim of pressing for further reform of the regime to reduce its costs, complexity and opportunities for fraud.—[

	<div class='member'>Mr. James Paice 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for her helpful replies. I do not want to detain the Committee. I wish to raise only two matters. The first is fraud, but not only the historical aspects to which the Minister referred. We must ensure that the system is far more robust. Mechanisms should be put in place, as the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye suggested, whereby national Governments are made liable for money that has been fraudulently claimed. That is an essential prerequisite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
I question the direction of support for the olive oil industry. It is now almost 10 years since the famous MacSharry reforms of the CAP, which, for most arable crop production, shifted away from production aid to direct aid. The Minister touched on that. Even in livestock, we have seen a move away from production aid to area-based aid. I am slightly puzzled, therefore, why the Commission is seeking to choose between payments per tree or per tonne, because both are production based. A tree is a unit of production, and a tonne is the result of that production, but both are clearly aids to production. The Commission's approach runs counter to the trend of reform to the CAP—we support the Government's desire to go much further—and counter to the trend of the GATT and the WTO talks, which the Minister rightly hoped would be operating at the same time as the next review of the CAP regime. I wonder why the Commission should want to choose between two forms of production aid; I do not negate the social need for that aid, but it should become area based, as it is throughout the rest of the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister touched on the difficulties of negotiation. Only five of the 15 member states have an interest in olive oil, so northern European member states should support further changes from production aid to direct aid. Consistency is needed in the olive oil regime. Reforms to it should be consistent with the reform of other regimes, which are now 10 years old, although the reforms of two years ago have moved us a stage further forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister used a term that I can only assume was meant to be a soundbite: "fraud-friendly mechanism". I congratulate her on her choice of phrase, but she will probably have to use it somewhere other than a European Standing Committee before it is picked up by the press. Nevertheless, it perfectly describes the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Government to press for reform of the olive oil regime to move it away from production altogether to a direct aid system consistent with the rest of the common agricultural policy reforms and the demands placed on Europe by the WTO. That would be much fairer and much less of a fraud-friendly mechanism, as we have found elsewhere. The GIS can be used to monitor compliance with an area-based system, but it obviously does not need to be so sophisticated as to identify individual olive trees, which is necessary under the present arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will take from the Committee the view succinctly expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth): we in this country are tired of fraud; we want the whole system to be tightened up and the CAP reforms incorporated into a system under which fraud is almost impossible. That would be fairer for us all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are asked to agree to the wording of the motion. Although I do not propose to amend it or vote against it, it is phrased in anodyne terms. Had I been asked to draft a motion, I should have expressed myself in more robust
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
terms. The operation of the whole common agricultural policy is a disgrace, but the operation of the olive oil regime—and, as the Minister said, of the tobacco regime—has been a scandal for far too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome moves in the right direction to remove the absurd consumption aid mechanism, but I share the concern of the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire about production aid. That is not how we have progressed—or at least what we have advocated—in other areas, where we have moved away from production aid to social and economic aid for disadvantaged regions. The disadvantaged region of the Mediterranean fringe is involved, and there are clear reasons for providing rural economic aid as part of the European strategy, but to do so in a way that allows gentlemen in smart suits to cream off so much of the money provided for different purposes is indefensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that there is to be an extension of the interim scheme simply because the Commission cannot make up its mind. The Minister says that she accepts the reasons for that; I am not sure that I do. I should have hoped for a more robust view, but let us accept the political reason, which is that, effectively, the matter is paralysed by a blocking minority. That has always been the case, and that is why it is so important that we establish a clear coalition of interests about the need for reform of the CAP and the introduction of a voting mechanism that will allow that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the wider question of the audit trail, the hon. Member for Norwich, North made a valuable point about the health aspects of olive oil. It concerns me greatly when I am told that the European food authority will be involved. I see no role for that body in this context, but I do see a need for robust internal systems in member states. I hope that we have now established a robust internal system, but I have yet to be convinced that some other European member states have done the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to auditing, there has been some improvement in systems in recent years. The treaty of Amsterdam moved us a little way and from it came the office that determines the audit trail. I remember trying, during the debate on the treaty of Amsterdam, to introduce more robust systems to connect the Court of Auditors with the very good British audit bodies. That move was unfortunately resisted both by the Government and the Conservative Opposition, but I thought—and still think—that it was important to strengthen those bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The treaty of Nice proposals also deal with the procedures of the Court of Auditors and the means of appointment to the Court. It is pointless to refuse to ratify the treaty of Nice and to declare an intention to fight any addition to qualified majority voting when one is providing a blocking vote of one to a recalcitrant country in the matter of appointments to the Court of Auditors or the mechanisms that are used to fight fraud. The two stances are incompatible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Italy is clearly in default. I am a great supporter of Italy and like the country very much, but I recognise that anywhere south of Umbria some strange business practices apply. It is curious that a country where the carabinieri are legally empowered to stop someone leaving a restaurant and demand to see a VAT receipt cannot establish how many olive trees there are in the south. The fact remains that Italy has not met its international obligations, and we must continue to remind it and the other countries that are in default of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to continue to strengthen the audit function in the European Union. It is unacceptable that fraud is costing the EU, on the 1998 figures that I have before me, £3 billion a year. That means that £3 billion of our money is being lost to fraud, which is a scandal. We must enable the auditors at European level to follow European money wherever it goes, without being blocked by the inefficiencies of member states' audit bodies and their inability to do the job properly. We need maximum co-operation between national audit bodies and the Court of Auditors and we need to change our systems so that, as the Minister said, they are no longer fraud-friendly. The reform of the common agricultural policy could go a great way towards that objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.18 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Ms Joyce Quin)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both hon. Members who have spoken have made very good points. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire was right to place his comments in the context of the common agricultural policy reform process. Our judgment about how to make progress with respect to the present regime will be made against the Government's overall objectives for CAP reform, which I believe all parties in the House of Commons support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned production aid, and I share his frustration. However, I should point out that it is not open ended. It is subject to maximum guaranteed quantities, within which there are also national allocations for each of the olive oil producers concerned. As the hon. Gentleman will know, that is analogous to other regimes in the CAP, such as those for flax and hemp.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the information being compiled to complete the geographic information system approach provides an accurate figure of olive trees and olive production across the European Union, that may be a useful tool for further reform of the regime. It would enable us to understand the dependence of particular areas on olive oil production and the needs of producers in those areas, and therefore how to decouple aid from production. Work on the GIS is extremely valuable in informing further reform decisions in the sector. Although the hon. Gentleman is right that at present it is related to production support, it may none the less be an important aspect of overall reform of the policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the frustrations of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath). None the less, I repeat that the scandals referred to in the report have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
been at least partially addressed by the important reforms of consumption aid, to which he referred. I certainly did not mean to imply that the European food authority would have any anti-fraud responsibility in the financial sector, but it could examine where food safety had been compromised by activities in member states. Obviously, the authority could and should work in conjunction with the existing European institutions set up to combat fraud. I was simply saying that food safety issues would be for the European food authority to consider; I did not mean to convey the impression that it would have any role in the detection or prosecution of financial irregularity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee is aware that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary recently led a general but detailed discussion of the European Union's anti-fraud measures and recent changes introduced to combat fraud in European Standing Committee B. That was an important debate that considered the increasing efforts of the Commission and member states to crack down on fraud, not only in the agricultural sector but throughout the range of European Union spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome correctly analysed the difficulty of moving reform forward in the sector because of the politics of the European Union. He mentioned the existence of a blocking minority; that is absolutely true. One frustration with the CAP has been the slow pace of reform because so many measures currently benefit a significant number of countries which can muster a blocking minority against change. That is part of the political climate in which we operate. That is why we must use some of the external pressures for change to which the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire referred, especially pressure from the
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
World Trade Organisation and from the budgetary consequences of enlargement of the EU. Although enlargement was not specifically referred to in the debate, it is worth pointing out that the majority of entrants, and especially of countries that are likely to join in any first wave of accession, will not be olive oil producers, so the enlargement process may be helpful in achieving change to the system. Some candidates for accession produce olive oil, but the balance is in favour of those with a budgetary interest in ensuring control and proper spending in the sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to move away from the traditional CAP approach on olive oil, as in other sectors. There is a good opportunity for that to happen if we can muster enough support in the Council of Ministers. It is interesting to consider the tables on consumption of olive oil in EU countries. There is increasing demand for olive oil. I do not believe that it is beyond our imagination to envisage a regime that would not need substantial amounts of public support and could thrive openly and competitively. The EU produces large quantities of high-quality olive oil, so it could supply the increasing number of consumers who want the product. Ultimately, that would be a far more sensible way in which to move forward than the system that has operated until now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
