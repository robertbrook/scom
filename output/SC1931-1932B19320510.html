	<div class='member'>Sir BASIL PETO</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we begin, I wish to raise a point of Order, because we have now got to a point in the Bill where several very important Amendments arise, almost on the same word, though not exactly so. At the end of our proceedings on Thursday the Question was put that the words "the Council of" stand part of the Clause. That is the point in the Bill at which we have arrived. I asked you whether that would shut out the next two Amendments, and you indicated that it would, and that you proposed to take as the next Amendment—
	<br><blockquote><p>"In page 1, line 7, to leave out 'any County or county borough' and to insert 'the county of London.'"</p></blockquote>
That is the first Amendment now standing on the Paper. Subsequent to that there was a short discussion concerning an important Amendment which had been cut out dealing with the question of jurisdiction being left to the justices of the peace in certain areas, and you said at the end of the proceedings, as your last remark addressed to the hon. Member for Bolton (Sir J. Haslam):
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think we shall be able to get the matter discussed on a later Amendment."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, Standing Committee B, 5th May, 1932, col. 1656.]</p></blockquote>
That was in view of the fact that the Under-Secretary had indicated that that was a question which he thought ought to have consideration. What I now wish to ask is whether you will take as the first Amendment the Amendment which now stands first on the Paper today, and, when we come to decide it,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1658</span>
put the Question in this form "That the words 'any county' stand part of the Clause." You will notice that I have put down an Amendment to that first Amendment—
	<br><blockquote><p>"In line 2, at end, insert 'may invite the justices of the peace for the petty sessional district having jurisdiction in the said county to appoint a committee of seven of their number who.'"</p></blockquote>
I do not want you to call that Amendment unless the Government representative should accept the first Amendment and so substitute the words "the county of London" for the words in the Bill, thus limiting Sunday performances to the county of London—or unless the Committee pass the Amendment. If that were done, my Amendment would then have the effect of requiring that the county of London should delegate authority to the justices of the peace.
Supposing this is not done, and the words in the Bill are allowed to remain, then the next Amendment I should hope that you would call would be this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In page 1, line 7, leave out 'or county borough'"—</p></blockquote>
and I hope that you would put the Question in the form "That the word 'or' stand part of the Clause," in order to protect two other important Amendments. On page 942, there is an Amendment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In page 1, line 7, leave out the second word 'county'."</p></blockquote>
The effect of that would be to remove the present limitation of power to county boroughs, and, coupled with the next Amendment, would extend it to boroughs with a population of not less than 20,000. Following that Amendment there is yet another:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In page 1, line 7, after 'borough' insert 'with a population of not less than fifty-five persons per acre'."</p></blockquote>
If those Amendments were carried, it would give authority to boroughs with a population of not less than 20,000 and with a density of population of not less than 55 persons to the acre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all those Amendments were negatived we should then arrive at the point where the words "council of any county or county borough" would be in the Bill, and after the word "borough" I should like you to call the Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Bolton which comes after that word "borough."
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0830">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1659</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"In page 1, line 7, after 'borough' insert 'shall appoint a committee composed of justices of the peace for the petty sessional district having jurisdiction in that county or borough who'."</p></blockquote>
If that were the order in which you took the Amendments we should then be able to discuss all these five important questions, and I do not see any other way of doing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we had better see how we get on first of all, though I think the hon. Member is about right in what he has suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. J. RUSSELL</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 7, to leave out the words "any county or county borough," and to insert instead thereof the words "the county of London."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment brings us right up against the real position with regard to this question in this country at the present time. Those of us who have watched the development of this discussion are well aware that had it not been for happenings in London we should not, in all probability, be here discussing this Bill. The introducer of the Bill in the last Parliament left no doubt as to that position, and every speaker either in the House or in Committee has repeatedly referred to the conditions in London and the necessity for something to be done in consequence of those conditions. Therefore, in submitting the Amendment that this matter be confined to London in the first instance, we are opening the way for the first step in the solution of a very vexed problem. London is different from anywhere else. It has preculiarities far beyond those of any other city, not only in this country but in the world. Week by week we are crowded with visitors who come here on business, on pleasure and for social activities, and it may well be, having regard to that influx of visitors, that there is a demand which does not arise elsewhere. We have no wish at any time to interfere with the responsible Government of such a place as London. If the host has certain sentiments, and the guest, albeit a paying guest, desires other things, it becomes very difficult indeed for the host to refuse his guest the things desired, and, although we may not like it, as a matter of courtesy we
	<span class='label label-info column'>1660</span>
are almost compelled to do something to meet the wishes of our guests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the visitors who come to London in such large numbers demand that there shall be something in the nature of Sunday cinemas or similar entertainments, courtesy makes it difficult to deny them. Then, again, we cannot deny that in London itself there is a demand for these things. That demand may seem very small when expressed in percentages, but in such a vast area, and with such a vast population, although the percentage may be small the actual numbers may be very large, and at any rate that number has been sufficient in the past to demand something on the lines of what has happened in London. I do not doubt that it is because of that substantial demand that the Loudon County Council felt themselves compelled to do something. If there is such a demand there would seem to be some reason for the Government to take action to protect the London County Council against attacks for having done that which at the present moment is illegal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conditions in London are peculiar from the point of view of the population and overcrowding. No other place that I know of can show such figures in regard to population as London. In certain areas the density of population is remarkable. In Bethnal Green there is a density of over 145 persons to the acre, in Fins-bury of 129 to the acre, in Holborn and Islington over 106, in Shoreditch of 158, in Southwark 153, in Stepney 141. Seeing that sanitary and health science rather indicates that the population ought not to exceed 29 to the acre, when we have reached the position shown by the figures I have quoted we must realise that we are up against a very serious problem. And yet I submit that for the Government to suggest that because of this state of affairs we should allow Sunday cinemas is to take a very dangerous line. The very last thing the Government should do is to introduce palliatives to bad health conditions, and yet here we are up against the conditions that I have mentioned. We do not want to stabilise bad conditions, but during the period whilst those conditions are being altered, it may be necessary to do something along the lines that have been suggested and, at all events, we want to make it quite clear that we are not out
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0831">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1661</span>
to compel people to continue as long as posible under unhealthy conditions or to prevent them getting out of those conditions as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another point. London is so large and so varied that it is almost voiceless in a matter of this kind. You could not for a moment get a referendum on a subject like this from the whole of the people who are affected. You could not possibly get an intelligent return from such a vast aggregation of people. It is different in that respect from other places, and for those reasons London has cinemas open. The fact is there and we have to face that fact, But none of these conditions applies elsewhere. In other towns you have not the same difficulty in consulting the inhabitants, the same congestion that you have in such a vast area as you have in London nor that vast aggregate of demand, although it is a small percentage, that you have in London. There is the real reason why we should first of all deal with London. It may be argued that this is unjust to other towns. I submit that it is not. If the people of another town wish to have Sunday entertainments, and if you have the precedent of London established, they can get it. All that is required is that the municipality should promote a Bill or, what is more likely, put a Clause into a Bill that they are promoting for other purposes. Then they must have a town's meeting, where the people can express themselves. The meeting can demand a poll, and they must express themselves in the poll.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No matter what may be our opinion, we have no right to say that, if the majority of the people in any district say by a poll that they require certain things, they shall not have them. The way is open to them without any alteration of the law. That being so, the way is open to us definitely to say that we apply this to London. All the arguments for the Bill are peculiar to London. Even the hospital demand in London is far higher than it is elsewhere. Here the national inflow makes the hospital provision a tremendous problem, and the hospital provision even itself is different here from what it is elsewhere, although it is difficult enough elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is a further reason why I hope the Committee will accept the Amendment. There has been a great deal
	<span class='label label-info column'>1662</span>
of talk both here and outside of a real desire to settle the question. No matter what the Press says, any hesitation in settling it will not come from this side of the House. We want the question settled, and I believe the whole country wants it settled, on reasonable and wise lines. You cannot expect us to agree to some of the conditions that are in the Bill. We cannot hand over a sacred institution unless we have some protection against the profiteering of those who care nothing for sacred institutions or anything else except profit. We have in this the first Amendment which it seems to me should receive general acceptance in the House and in the country if we confine this in this first place to London and then leave it to other places to take the ordinary method of a Clause in a Bill; and, having a precedent already established, it throws upon the people of these other districts the responsibility and the option of taking such action as they feel to be wise. Then there is the very simple matter of protecting the worker, and everyone who has discussed the Bill has agreed that the worker ought to be protected. Then you have to make charity a real thing, and everyone has agreed to that also being done. Then we want some protection with regard to the character of the films shown. The Amendment to this Amendment which appears on the Paper will safeguard the community in regard to that. Then I should like, if possible, to see the Bill so arranged that it can give, either in London or elsewhere, some further protection to the people in regard to dog-racing and other activities. All along those lines I believe we can almost at once come to a settlement of the question and, because the Amendment is the first instalment, I hope the Committee will accept it and let us get down to the business of carrying the Bill through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MACPHERSON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel sure that the Committee as a whole will agree that the speech we have just heard was not only comprehensive but that it opened the way to a compromise. There are some of us probably who would go further in the direction of compromise than others, and I was hoping, particularly after the statements I had seen in the Press, that we should have begun our sitting to-day with a statement from the Under-Secretary that the Govern-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0832">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1663</span>
ment propose to take some sort of action, letting us understand exactly what their intentions are. The Amendment raises the whole issue in a very acute form, because London itself raised the issue primarily in an acute form. London is a capital quite unique. It has its varied population. It has its over-population, and one cannot help feeling that one of the most potent arguments advanced in favour of the Bill has been the argument that London is so over-populated and that, when the workers of the country have a free day, such as they have on Sunday, it would be a crime to compel them to remain in their overcrowded conditions without giving them the opportunity of going to a place of amusement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every member of the Committee must have had day after day in his post-bag letters from borough and county councils all over the country. It is clear that these local public bodies are not satisfied with the Bill. Some of them claim the right as county councils to be the determining factors. The urban and the borough councils say they should have the right to determine whether cinemas should be open or not. So that, if you judge from the feeling all over the country among these local bodies, you must come to the conclusion that the Bill does not meet with the approval of any public body in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment gets rid of all local troubles, jealousies, difficulties and elections, with the ascertaining of public opinion and with corruption, and you deal with a problem which has faced the country for 20 years. A great many people regret the fact, but the problem of the cinema in London is an established problem, and the great argument that has been adduced against the Bill is that it proposes to legalise the illegalities of 20 years. Several people take the view that, seeing that the illegality has existed for 20 years, it ought to be condoned. A great many people strongly oppose that view, and there is no doubt that this question has to be faced. Many people hate compromise of any kind, but the very fair-minded line taken by my hon. Friend must have appealed to the Committee. In a word, what he suggests is this. London has raised this question in an acute form. For 20 years the overcrowded populations of London have been
	<span class='label label-info column'>1664</span>
accustomed to the cinemas being open. Much against our will, let us recognise that fact and deal with it. That is a very fair-minded way of approaching the question, and it is a long step in advance towards compromise. I think the Amendment should meet with the approval of the sponsors of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not going to enter into the vexed question of hospitals, though I think one of the most contemptible things of all was the introduction of this so-called charity into the Bill as an inducement to open cinemas. I come from a part of Scotland where we have one of the finest rural hospitals in the world. The Highland chief there asked for a voluntary collection—not a collection based upon chance or the vicissitudes of chance—for £100,000 to support and endow the hospital. Every single penny of that money was raised by the voluntary contributions of the people in the vicinity. In my judgment there has been nothing more contemptible in the history of politics than the attempt on the part of interested people by an inducement of this sort to get through a Bill which affects the conscience of the whole country, rural and urban. I was very pleased to hear attention drawn to the fact that if a Bill of any kind for this purpose is to go through, there must be proper protection for the workers. I shall endeavour, if this Bill goes on, to make it clear that no man is to be compelled to work on Sunday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great many Members speak from the urban point of view on this subject. Probably, in regard to matters connected with the priceless heritage of the Sabbath day, there is greater latitude among urban people than among rural people. The fact remains that in almost every glen and valley and strath and throughout the countryside in this land of ours there is still a very strong feeling on the other side. While recognising certain new, and, to them, disagreeable facts, those who have that feeling, are determined that there shall be no further inroad on the sanctity of the Sunday. As I said, the workers must be protected. It was my privilege to move the rejection of the first Bill dealing with this question. I then had about 700 letters and I was greatly struck by the fact that many of those letters came from workers who were called upon to perform Sunday duty. One letter was written on behalf
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0833">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1665</span>
of 11 workers in a cinema and that letter, which I think I still have and can produce if need be, showed that those men were compelled to work on Sunday and were nominally paid 7s. 6d. for their day's work. In fact they only received 3s. 6d. each for the day, but they had to sign receipts for 7s. 6d. each and the other 4s. was taken in the sacred name of administration. That was the way in which this so-called charity was being distributed to the hospitals of this country. That is a contemptible thing, and I shall be greatly surprised if the workers of this country tolerate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment gives my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary the opportunity of making a statement. He must realise from the feeling in this Committee that the Bill, as it stands, is impossible, and cannot command the respect or concurrence of the House of Commons as a whole, still less of the country as a whole. I suggest respectfully that at this juncture my hon. Friend ought to make a statement, and I feel sure that that is the wish of every member of the Committee. We find it irksome, to put it bluntly, to come here morning after morning to discuss this Bill when there is an understanding, whether open, secret, or inferential, that the Bill as it stands will never see the Statute Book. If that be true it should be in the interests of the promoters of the Bill, in the interests of London and of the country as a whole, that some proposal on the lines of the speech just delivered should be looked at by the Government—I will not go any further now—and that at this stage we should either adjourn the further consideration of this Bill or hear a definite statement as to the intentions of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In making that request I feel sure that I am voicing the sentiments of the Committee. If the Bill is to be proceeded with, it can only have a meed of success and gain a measure of support by the acceptance of an Amendment of this kind. This is a clear and definite Amendment and, while Parliament may be prepared, with good will, to accept a compromise, it will not, in my judgment, be acceptable to Parliament to have this Bill foisted upon it by the big battalions downstairs. Accordingly, I repeat, with the greatest respect, that this is the time when my hon. Friend should tell us the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1666</span>
real intentions of the Government. If he is not prepared to do so, but is prepared on the other hand to dispute this Amendment and take it to a Division, then I think he is making a great mistake. It is a fair Amendment which deals with a hard, established fact, and it was with the object of dealing with that fact that the Bill was primarily introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Major OWEN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment for a specific reason. I have examined the personnel of this Committee, and I find that, apart from myself, there is only one other Member representing the Principality of Wales and Monmouthshire. [
	<i>Laughter.</i>] That statement may amuse some Members, but it is not a question of amusement to the inhabitants of the Principality and that section of them to which I have the honour to belong. Scotland and Northern Ireland are deliberately excused from the provisions of the Bill, but it is sought to include the Principality of Wales and Monmouthshire. The position in Wales is very different from that which exists in England. For over 50 years we have had special legislation in Wales with regard to the observance of Sunday. The Sunday Closing Act has now celebrated its jubilee there and the observance of Sunday is a matter of as much concern in Wales as in any part of Scotland or Northern Ireland. The day is still regarded as a day set aside for worship and rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have here a pamphlet which was drawn up when the previous Bill was under consideration. It is called "The Case for Wales and Monmouthshire" and it contains resolutions on this subject and the personnel of deputations which I intended to bring before the then Home Secretary. These are not resolutions passed by certain narrow sections of the community. They are representative of all sections of opinion, religious and otherwise, throughout Wales. I give the Committee a few examples. The Church of Wales is represented by the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of St. David's and other high dignitaries of the Church, while other bodies represented are: the Council of the Evangelical Churches, Cardiff; the Cymmrodorian Society, Cardiff; the Presbyterian Church of Wales, representing 294,547 adherents;
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0834">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1667</span>
the Committee for Mutual Understanding and Co-operation for Wales and Monmouthshire; the Baptist Union of Wales; the East Glamorgan Baptist Association; the South Wales People's Training Institute; the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland; the Congregational Union of England and Wales, and the Methodist Union of England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thas has never been any real demand in any part of Wales for Sunday opening. I am told that one or two cases have occurred quite recently, following the bad example set by towns in England. I understand that two or three cinemas in Rhyl have been opened on Sunday, and the excuse has been that they have been opened to order to cater for visitors from other parts of the country. But taking Wales as a whole, there has never been any demand. In fact there is profound and sincere opposition to the imposition of this Measure on that part of the country. We know what is going to happen. We know what has happened in London. The cinemas in London were opened in the first instance, not because the people of London sought to have them opened, but because certain people desired to make profits not only on six days but on seven days of the week. What is the position to-day? We know—we see it in the newspapers every day—that the cinema is losing its hold. Cinemas are being converted to use for performances of the old kind. What is the truth? The people are becoming "fed up" and tired of the cinema, and those behind the cinemas, those who own them and make profit out of them, are using this Bill as a means to keep alive the industry in which they have sunk their money and out of which they have hitherto made their profit. If London desires this Bill, let London have it, but I doubt if London wants it. I am very doubtful whether the people of London as a whole want the Bill. Durham refused to open cinemas on Sunday. Has there been a revolution in Durham?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, the City of Durham has closed its cinemas on Sunday, and there has not been any outcry in Durham and I am doubtful whether there would be any outcry in London if they were closed. It might be organised by the people who have this industry and its success at heart, but I have lived in London for 21 years and more, and I have never found that there was a general desire for opening places of amusement in London on Sunday. It may have altered within the last, few years—I do not know—but surely we have to face one thing at any rate, and if the hon. Gentleman is going to continue with this Bill as it is, all that I can say is that I shall oppose it the whole time and do everything that I can to prevent its getting on the Statute Book. If a case is made out for London, let us have it, and rather than oppose such a demand I am quite willing to give in, but I say emphatically, Let us limit as far as we possibly can the provisions of this Bill. The country as a whole, taking it from one end to the other, is satisfied to observe this day as a day of rest. In large parts of the country there is still a desire to pay tribute to the God Who has enabled them to live a life of comfort and some satisfaction in this world; and if the hon.

Cromarty (Mr. Macpherson) made speeches in extremely moderate tones, in which they appealed to me to make some statement about the future of this Bill, and they indicated a desire for compromise and that now was the time for me to respond to it. I cannot say though that the subsequent speech from the hon. and gallant Member for Carnarvonshire (Major Owen) is one that is likely to encourage response to such an invitation. If he represents the real feeling of this Committee, it is clear that there is an important gulf between us. If we are to look on the opening of Sunday cinemas purely as the machinations of profit-seeking cinema owners and to disregard even the possibility that there may be quite decent citizens who see no harm in going to, and have the desire to visit, a cinema on Sunday, then indeed any suggestion of compromise is hopeless. But I prefer to regard the speeches of the hon. Member who moved the Amendment and of my right hon. and learned Friend as being more typical of the attitude of the opponents of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The actual Amendment which we are discussing is limited in its scope, but during the Debate so far we have had large and general re-statements of the whole point of view, and I, for one, am not at all averse to seeking to obtain upon this Amendment, as well as on any other, the decision of the Committee as to whether this Bill should be proceeded with or not, and during the course of the Debate to ascertain from hon. Members of all shades of opinion what their views are as to future procedure. Let me refer in detail to some of the points which the hon. Member who moved the Amendment made, particularly because I feel that he enunciated principles which, if they represent his views, are capable of extension considerably beyond the very narrow scope of this Amendment. He instanced London as being, for some reason or other, quite different from any other part of the country, and it was for that reason, he said, that he was prepared to extend to London a privilege which he was not prepared to extend to any other part of England or Wales, but I must confess that, following his speech, I was unable to detect this great difference between London and any other centre of population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Take density. It is true that there are certain parts of London denser than parts
	<span class='label label-info column'>1670</span>
of other cities, and certain parts of London less dense, but no one can really say that the difference between the right to open a Sunday cinema and the right to close it should depend on whether you have a density of 80 or 90 persons per acre. Take courtesy to guests, the fact that thousands of visitors who come to London wish to go to a cinema and the impossibility, therefore, for the courteous host to refuse what his guest desires. What about Blackpool or Morecambe? They have guests in far greater proportion to their population than London ever gets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. RHYS DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not foreigners, surely?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, we are only to be courteous to foreign visitors? I rather understood that the hon. Member was prepared to extend the same privileges to people of his own race and nationality. Finally, we come down, I think, to the real point, that in London the thing is an established fact and that therefore we have to face it. Well, why should we not face it in the other 96 areas where it is also an established fact? Why is it less an established fact because cinemas open in Blackpool or in More-cambe or in many districts of Durham than it is when cinemas open in London? I can see no logical reason whatsoever for drawing a distinction between London, where cinemas have opened in the past, and any other area where cinemas have opened and where, therefore, there is an established fact which you have to face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. J. RUSSELL</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman has omitted one vital fact, that I laid stress on the voicelessness of London owing to its size and complexity, and the ease with which the people in the other towns can express themselves, either by poll or town's meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That seems to me to be a strong argument in favour of accepting the whole 96. If it is so easy in those other districts to obtain the feeling of the locality, we may be quite certain that the fact that they have opened and are open now is due to the fact that there is a desire in that locality. The hon. Member cannot have it both ways. I, for one—and I think most hon. Members of the Committee would agree with me—could not for a moment accept any

	<span class='label label-info column'>1671</span>
Measure which applied to London alone and left out the 96 other authorities who in the past have acted on the same lines as London and in the future are entitled to the same treatment as London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member made, I think, one very significant statement, and I took it carefully down, because if it really represents the views of himself and his supporters, it is a most important declaration. He said that if the majority requires the opening of Sunday cinemas, no one has the right to say that they shall not have it. That, of course, is the principal embodied in this Bill, but I am glad to know that the hon. Member made that statement, with all responsibility and as representing the point of view for which he stands, because I think it does represent, as hon. Members will recognise, a very considerable advance towards a solution of this very difficult problem. He went on to say that the principle he had enunciated could be carried out by the ordinary private Bill procedure, although I must own that I could not quite see how that squared with the principle, because under private Bill procedure, as he very well knows, it is quite possible for a majority, as shown at a town's meeting and on a poll, to put a Bill before Parliament, and for Parliament to refuse it—in fact, for Parliament not to do the one thing which the hon. Member said that nobody had the right to do, which was to refuse the desires of the majority of the in habitants of a locality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. J. RUSSELL</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman is rather misrepresenting my position. I think he would find, if he looked up the facts, that in regard to private Bills which come before this House the whole question is one of precedents, and I stated distinctly that, having the precedent of London, Parliament would find it very difficult indeed to refuse the same to other communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure, though I leave it to the Committee, that they will agree that I mis-stated what the hon. Member had said, but anyhow it is something to know that a private Bill of this kind would in future receive his support. As everybody knows, it is quite true that the private Bill procedure, as far at any rate as it concerns urban dis-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1672</span>
tricts, provides in the most complete way for finding the local opinion. There can be no possibility of doubt that before a private Bill is presented to Parliament local opinion has to be in favour of it, but hon. Members may be less well acquainted with the subsequent procedure on a private Bill. They may well ask themselves whether really it is fair to expect—and here we are taking the assumption of the hon. Member who moved the Amendment that London and certain other authorities have got this—that under certain conditions laid down in the Bill it is open to any authority to approach Parliament to be added to this list. Hon. Members will realise that it was simply a question there of "Yes" or "No." Is the individual local authority to have the same privilege which the 97 already possess?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ordinary private Bill procedure is long, complicated, and cumbersome. It is designed to deal with the case of a complicated body of local legislation, every point of which requires testing, and every point of which may possibly be amended. Is that a procedure which is really suitable to a case where there can be no question of amendment or of modification, but simply of the right of Parliament to say "Yes" or "No" to a simple question of whether one authority is to be given the privileges which certain other authorities already possess? I doubt whether the House of Commons would like to see obstacles put in the way of a local authority, not obstacles of public opinion or of opposition in this House, but purely of the cost and the trouble of a particular, cumbersome form of procedure which has no relation in fact to the particular question which it is desired to bring before the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, may I point out to the Committee the omission which is noticeable in this Amendment and which was even more noticeable in the speech of the hon. and gallant Member for Carnarvonshire, an omission to remember that this is not entirely a cinema question, but that there are certain other forms of Sunday activities which I think all, with very few exceptions, are prepared to agree are not in fact contrary to the spirit of Sunday observance? The concert, the museum, the Zoological Gardens, even the debate are, by common consent, things which could perfectly properly be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0837">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1673</span>
allowed on Sundays without inflicting grievous injury on the consciences of the strict Sabbatarians.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir B. PETO</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why then, under the structure of this Bill, is it not proposed that Parliament should deal with that situation? Why do the Government not propose that those harmless forms of entertainment should be definitely legalized?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Baronet had allowed me to proceed and find out the feeling of the Committee, he would find, I think, that the interjection he made might prove to be valuable at a subsequent stage of the Debate. I was pointing out that although in this Bill, and in the whole controversy, cinemas may overshadow the whole of the rest of the problem, yet the rest of the problem does exist, and has to be dealt with somehow or other. When the hon. and gallant Member opposite made his passionate denunciation on behalf of Wales, he was a little unfair, because he forgets that however rare the Sunday opening of a cinema may be there a Sunday concert is by no means an unusual feature of Welsh life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Major OWEN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree. I may have expressed rather strong feelings, but those feelings very largely arise from the absolute refusal on the part of the Government to allow the people of Wales to decide for themseves about this question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir JOHN HASLAM</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the Government. It is a private Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Major OWEN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The previous Bill was a Government Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it was not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Major OWEN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am making my appeal to the hon. Gentleman to give that consideration to Wales which it has had in previous legislation. It is no good ignoring a whole people, as—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave way for a moment to the hon. and gallant Member, but not for the purpose of allowing him to make another speech. He might tell this Committee clearly a thing which we have never yet been told. Does Wales want to be left out of any legislation which makes legal, possibly under certain conditions, the holding of Sunday concerts or the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1674</span>
exhibition of animate or inanimate objects, or the holding of debates?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Major OWEN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the legalisation of Sunday concerts is to include the legalisation of the Sunday opening of cinemas, then I say, "No, we do not want the legalisation of Sunday concerts."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not the question. After all, this is a matter of importance. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] An hon. Member says, "No," but that is not a very helpful interjection. I am asked by people who are taking a prominent part in the opposition to this Bill to test the feeling of this Committee and to make suggestions, perhaps a some subsequent stage, as to the course of action we must take. The hon. and gallant Member represents Wales here, and I should like to hear from him what the feeling of Wales is. Do they, in fact, want Sunday concerts to be legalised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Major OWEN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered that question once. I say the people of Wales would like to see Sunday concerts legalised—certainly; but they do not want to see Sunday concerts legalised on condition that Sunday cinemas also are legalised. If that is to be the condition, then I say we do not want Sunday concerts legalised; we are prepared to hold our sacred Sunday concerts without charging anything for admission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and gallant Member. Now I have got an answer to my question. Wales is not opposed to the legalisation of Sunday concerts, zoos, museums, and debates in so far as they stand alone. Its opposition is solely to the opening of Sunday cinemas. From the speeches already made I have, from at least one section of the Committee, got a fair indication of their views. I feel that it would be right and proper to take the Division on this Amendment as a real test of the feelings of the Committee as to our future proceedings, and I hope that during the course of the further Debate more light will be thrown upon possible ways of solving a problem which we all want to see solved. In particular, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman opposite for the moderate way, having regard to the well-known views that he holds, in which he moved his Amendment and initiated this Debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Major DESPENCER - ROBERTSON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has stated that he wants to test the feeling of the Committee. I have put down an Amendment which goes a good deal further than the Amendment in question—
	<br><blockquote><p>In Clause 1, page 1, line 7, to leave out from the word "borough," to the word "notwithstanding," in line 12, and to insert "which has, prior to the first day of January, nineteen hundred and thirty-two, permitted any place within their area to be opened, and used for public entertainment, or amusement, or for public debate on Sundays shall be allowed to continue such entertainments."</p></blockquote>
I was wondering, Mr. Nicholson, whether you would give me an opportunity of moving that Amendment in order to test the feeling of the Committee on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. and gallant Member will have an opportunity of moving it, but at a rather later point in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McENTEE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Committee will not accept the Amendment we are discussing. I notice that an hon. Member opposite expressed concern about the question of Sunday labour; if he looks down the list of Amendments he will see that I have made an attempt to secure that the workers shall not be required to work more than six days a week. What has struck me this morning has been the moderation of the speeches in favour of this Amendment and the apparent desire for compromise. I do not suppose that anybody wants the discussion of this Bill to be prolonged until it is too late to get it passed through Parliament before October, and I daresay that most members would be willing to accept any reasonable compromise; but as one who lives in a populous area just beyond the borders of the county of London, an area where the people undoubtedly desire the Sunday opening of cinemas, concerts and other entertainments, I should be very sorry indeed if the conditions which at present exist in that area were to be continued. Every Sunday now the tramways, the omnibuses and the trains do a very good trade in taking many hundreds, and probably many thousands, of people out of my area, Walthamstow, where Sunday cinemas are not permitted, into areas where they are; and I dare say a similar state of affairs exists elsewhere on the out-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1676</span>
skirts of London. Take a place like West Ham. It is quite as densely populated as some of the areas in the county of London, and is similar to London in many ways; yet under this Amendment West Ham would be prevented from having Sunday cinemas, as they now have, while in London they would be allowed. The result would be that people would go into London from West Ham, as they go now from Walthamstow, to obtain their amusements, and there would be still greater congestion in London on Sundays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Was there any argument put up by those who spoke in favour of this Amendment this morning which could not equally well be used in favour of West Ham, Blackpool, Brighton and scores of other places? Is it to be suggested that the privilege is to be confined to London, and that other areas which want it must go to the trouble of promoting a private Bill to secure it? I have had a little experience of the difficulty and the expense of promoting private Bills. My district desires Sunday cinemas—almost every member of the local council has expressed himself in favour of them—but mine is a poor district, and we do not want to be put to the expense of promoting a private Bill. The hon. and gallant Member who spoke on behalf of Wales told us that the Principality did not want Sunday cinemas. I do not think anybody said they did, and if the Bill goes through in its present form there is no reason why they should have them. There is nothing in the Bill to compel any part of Wales to have cinemas open on Sundays. I have spent some very enjoyable holidays in Wales, and have attended concerts there on Sundays, paying for admission. I hope to go there again, and, unless somebody gives me a free ticket, I suppose I shall have to pay if I desire to go to a concert on a Sunday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we adopt the principle that because London is congested, that because London entertains visitors and because London already has cinemas, London should he allowed to have them in future, by what process of logic can we deny cinemas to West Ham or Blackpool or any of the other places with cinemas? The logic of that argument would appear to be that we ought to legalise Sunday cinemas in the 96 places where they are at present
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0839">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1677</span>
open. That might appear a compromise which would be acceptable to a considerable number of members of the Committee, but nobody representing a constituency like mine could accept such a compromise. If West Ham is to be permitted to have cinemas on Sunday, why not Walthamstow, if there is an equal desire for them in Walthamstow? If we try to reason the thing out logically I think it must be realised that the Bill offers the most reasonable compromise we could get. I have heard a good deal of argument against the principle of local option, but, after all, are we not accepting the principle of local option in this Amendment? The principle behind the Amendment appears to be, "London obviously desires Sunday cinemas, and therefore London should have them." If we accept the principle of local option in regard to London, why should we refuse it to any place outside London? I hope the Committee will reject the Amendment, because it is far too narrow, and if there is to be a compromise I hope it will approach nearer to the principle on which the Bill is framed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. RHYS DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid the hon. Gentleman representing the Home Office has not carried us very far this morning. I thought he would have been in a little better temper, if I may say so with respect. [HON. MEMBERS: Oh, oh!"] When I interjected something about foreigners in London, I wanted to remind the hon. Gentleman that one of the main arguments always advanced in support of this Bill has been that we must cater for the foreigners who come to London. Everyone who has made an attack on what is called D.O.R.A. has done so because on the Continent there is nothing of the kind in existence and that, London being such a cosmopolitan centre, attracting foreigners, this Bill ought to be passed. I have heard of these foreigners for years. They are not new, and that is why I interjected, to inform the hon. Gentleman that London for this purpose is not like Morecambe. You cannot compare a little seaside town up there with London for this purpose. I have never been unwilling to a compromise with the promoters of the Bill, but anything on the lines suggested by the hon. Member is impossible. What he really wants is the Bill as it now stands. How can you get a compromise
	<span class='label label-info column'>1678</span>
between those who are opposed to the Bill and those who are still agreeing with it as it stands? That is an impossible, situation. I will say what I think, and anything that I say afterwards will not alter my view about a compromise. My concern from the beginning is about the workpeople in connection with the industry, and I have more reason to stand up on the labour point of view than ever because, since we commenced discussing this Bill, in fact during this year, the employers in Monmouthshire have asked the miners to work with coal-cutting machines on Sundays, a thing unheard of in the whole history of the South Wales coalfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. HERBERT WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. A good deal of the Debate has had very little relation to the Amendment. The question of working on Sundays in general has no relation to the proposal whether the Bill should apply to a particular area or not. We are solely discussing the geographical scope of the Bill and these matters are totally irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is simply a matter of substituting the "County of London" for "any county or county borough." I do not know what the hon. Gentleman is going to say on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I know as much about procedure as the hon. Gentleman, and I do not think he is entitled to interject in that way. He ought to know better. I was going to show the difference between what happens in London and what happens elsewhere, and to point out the effect of this demand for Sunday opening on the point I was making, that the employers of Monmouthshire, because of the loose talk of working on Sunday in the entertainment industry, are now wanting the men to work in the coal mines on Sundays, and I object to this extension of employment on Sunday for any purpose. I am not unwilling, in spite of my antagonism to the Bill, to a compromise, and I thought the Home Office, after the narrow majority for the Bill in the House and after the Debate in Committee last week, would try to compromise these elements and bring in a new Bill to try to satisfy both sides. Those who are opposed to a Bill that has been drafted by the Government are always in a difficulty. When I was in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0840">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1679</span>
the hon. Gentleman's post I could appear very much more intelligent than I can now and, when he comes here in three or four years' time he will be less intelligent to the Committee than he is now, with all the information that he has at the back of him from the Home Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. Gentleman will keep to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was leading up to it. I have here the report of a debate at the Manchester Cinema Exhibitors' Association, which shows the difference between the outlook on life in London and in a place like Manchester.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Edward Cheshire advocated the opening of cinemas without invoking State aid. Mr. Stansfield said Sunday opening was like a two-edged sword. They had Sunday opening in America, but the cinemas that opened on Sundays closed three days in the week."</p></blockquote>
It is an astonishing thing that, where you have Sunday opening, they come to the conclusion that they could get only so much money out of a community, and that it does not matter how many days in the week they open.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Burnley representative said after paying double wages, contributing to charity and losing patronage at the beginning of the week, the opening on Sunday was not worth the candle."</p></blockquote>
That is exactly my point of view.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The acting Chairman, Mr. John Harrison, said that, from what he had heard, half the exhibitors did not want Sunday opening."</p></blockquote>
These are not the people who are supposed to want Sunday opening, but the people who run the shows themselves. No resolution was passed. The people there are divided on the issue. There is a fundamental difference between the outlook on this day of rest in London and in other parts of the country. The hon. Gentleman was a little annoyed with the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Carnarvonshire (Major Owen). There is one point that ought to be cleared up on that score. I shall be astonished if there have ever been Sunday concerts in Wales run for private profit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is not whether it is run for private or any other kind of profit. It is the fact that people have to pay to enter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1680</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely Parliament is entitled to do what it likes, whether it is private profit or otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry I did not make myself clear. The question whether it is legal or illegal depends not on how the profits are distributed, but on whether people have to pay to enter and, whether or no Sunday concerts in Wales are run entirely for charitable purposes, they are at present illegal if people pay to enter them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But Parliament could always make it legal for all these things to be done for charitable purposes and make it illegal if they are done for private profit. The mere fact that the law is so now does not alter my argument. Every newspaper that I have seen in London advocates the opening of cinemas on Sunday. I do not want to be unkind to newspapers, but it is obvious why they are advocating it, because their advertisement revenue will go up. But there are newspapers in the provinces, where cinemas are not opened on Sundays, which are opposed to Sunday opening, and you have that difference between London and the provinces. There is another fact to remember. Nearly all the central organisations connected with this trade are in London. The central office of the Cinema Exhibitors' Association is in London. The Committee ought to remember, too, that the cinema trade does not bother very much about the problem whether we should have one day's rest in seven. They have definitely set up organisations, not with the idea, as we are told here, of providing amusement for the people, but deliberately in order to open all places of entertainment everywhere throughout the land. They make no secret of it. All this to-do about charity and providing people with entertainment on Sunday does not bother them at all. There are people behind this movement who do not care what is done on any day of the week, dog-racing, boxing or otherwise, provided there is 5 or 10 per cent. behind it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is going too far. The question is whether we should leave out "county or county borough" and insert "the County of London."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. Gentleman will see the two points of view that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0841">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1681</span>
are expressed. I am not unwilling to a compromise with the promoters. I have been a little astonished, even on this Amendment, that we have not had a conference of the representatives of the two sides to discuss Amendments of this kind. The hon. Gentleman would be well advised to call a conference of representatives of the two sides to see whether a compromise can be achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. DENVILLE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very evident that the object is to carry on at the rate of one Amendment a day, which means chat we shall be here till Christmas. [HON. MEMBERS: "Withdraw!"] I will certainly withdraw if it pleases you. I chink I can cast a little light on this subject. If the Bill went through as it stands, the position in the country would be no different from what it is at present. Those who are opposing the Bill are making a mistake, because they are taking out of our hands an opportunity of dealing with the Bill which we shall not have under such favourable circumstances if this becomes a Government Bill. This does not mean that all provincial towns will open cinemas on Sundays. It means that it will place them in the position that it is legal for them to open on Sunday. At present, where they do not desire a place of entertainment to be open on Sunday, the licensing authority takes advantage of certain conditions which it is empowered to put into every licence and says, "We shall grant you a six-day licence, but you must not apply for one on Sunday."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing only with the question of whether the licensing authority should be the council of "any county or county borough" or of "the county of London."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. DENVILLE</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. HANNON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I at once admit the gracious way in which the hon. Member has referred to this matter, but a little cautionary advice may not be out of place all the same. I was impressed by the statement of the Under-Secretary that he was going to regard this Amendment as crucial, in regard to the fate of the Bill. I fail to see on what ground he can take that attitude. I was impressed by his own argument as to the extraordinary situation which would be created if the Amendment were adopted. He said we were going to deprive some 96 other districts of a privilege which would be conferred upon London. That seems an extraordinary situation and one which could not be defended on grounds of justice. The Committee is suffering a great disadvantage from the fact that my Noble Friend the Member for Horsham (Earl Winterton) who has made such striking, helpful and inspiring contributions to Debates in Committee and in the House, has taken no part in our discussions. He, of all Members in this Committee, would be able to give us a lead and advise us on an intricate subject of this kind as affecting London 
	<i>vis a vis</i> other counties and county boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not opposing this Bill with any idea of depriving people in London or elsewhere of the opportunity for wholesome recreation. The Under-Secretary referred to recreations and entertainments other than the cinema, but even the cinema, from my point of view, would have its place, if a moral censorship could be established to make it a clean and wholesome institution. I think that the basis of compromise may be found in the removal from Sunday entertainments of those offensive and objectionable aspects with which many of us are familiar in our crowded towns and which cannot but have a serious influence on the quality of our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0842">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1683</span>
national life. If compromise could be reached along those lines I do not see why opposition to the Bill should not cease. The selection of London in this Amendment is a test case but I am afraid that it will not settle the question. To me, local option of any description is objectionable. I am against it, root and branch, as far as it affects the direction of social affairs in this country. Local option should be removed, not merely as affecting London Taut as affecting the rest of the country. But if we go on the lines of making Sunday entertainments minister to the uplift of the people of the country, I, for one, would support my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary in carrying this Bill. I appeal to him to look at the question from that point of view and to realise that many of us who are now opposing the Bill are not doing so on any grounds, other than those which we regard as being in the interests of the character of the people of this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Committee is now prepared to come to a decision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir JOSEPH LAMB</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the Amendment, and I hope that the discussion is not going to be brought to an end yet, because the Under-Secretary has expressed a wish to hear the views of as many Members of the Committee as possible before a Division is taken, which, he says, will affect his action as regards compromise later on. I support the Amendment, not because I am in favour of cinemas in London, but because of the present conditions in London, which make any alteration of the position there very difficult. It is more difficult to take away from people that which they have enjoyed for some time than to deny them something in the first instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several Members of the Committee have been rather unfair, I think, in stating that they see no difference between London on the one hand, and places like Blackpool and Brighton on the other. It is true that there is a migratory population in both cases, but the people who go to the seaside do so very largely because the sea happens to be there. At least, in most cases, I believe, the sea is there, although at Southport, I understand, it is a considerable distance away. In the case of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1684</span>
most seaside resorts, however, the sea is, or ought to be, the chief attraction to visitors, and we are not going to say that the sea should be closed to them on Sundays. There is a difference between the case of the seaside resorts and the case of London with its great population, and the strongest ground for supporting this Amendment is that it is a limitation on the operation of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also support very strongly the line taken by the hon. Member for West-houghton (Mr. Rhys Davies) that the proposal in the Bill is an infringement of the rights of the workers. It is all very well to say that these people will only work six days in the week. What has made the character of this country? It has been the character of the individual, and what has made the character of the individual has been home life. What home life is there for a man who works every Sunday and is free only m a Tuesday or a Wednesday when his children are at school and his wife is probably at work? Then, we are told, this Bill is necessary in London and other populous places because of the slums. I hope that those who have social reform at heart will never fall back on the expedient of the provision of cinemas as against the removal of slums.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member will keep to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir J. LAMB</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said that I am supporting the Amendment, not because I believe in cinemas in London, but because of the necessity for compromise, and I am dealing with the argument which has been used in regard to the slums in London. I was about to say that if people are likely to be demoralised because they cannot go to the cinemas on Sundays, in London or elsewhere, what is to happen to them on the other six days of the week? They do not go to the cinemas every night. There is, of course, a religious aspect of this question, but I hope that we are not going to allow the religious aspect to enter too much into the consideration of the Bill either as regards London or elsewhere. We hear a great deal of talk about freedom and the right of people to do what they like, but those who speak in that way often forget the freedom and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0843">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1685</span>
the rights of others. So long as persons do not employ or necessitate the employment of others, I believe they have the right to do what they like on Sunday. But I am confident that this proposal in the Bill will be an infringement of the rights of the workers. I am told that leaders of the workers' movement abroad would be only too glad if they could get rid of the Continental Sunday, because that is what deprives them of their weekend rest. By means of this proposal, the rights and freedom of our own workers, in this respect, would be taken from them bit by bit. I hope that the Under-Secretary will allow some sort of compromise to be arrived at, so that we may get a Bill which will satisfy, at least, a majority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. DORAN</div> <!-- member -->

I am not anxious to see the Christian Sunday butchered in order to make a commercial holiday, and I hope the Committee will take my word for it, that I am as God-fearing as any person who has spoken on this Bill, either in this Committee or in the House of Commons. I pay my respects to my Creator in the same orthodox way as many other people who revere the Christian faith, and I can assure this Committee that I am not utterly lost to the reality of my duty. I am going to be perfectly frank this morning and to say that when I came before the electors last October I told the people in my constituency what a wonderful lot they were—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I can say is that I think it a waste of time to continue with this Committee in view of the position which is before us. I think it is a farce. The Home Secretary ought to have the courage to take this matter into his own hands and give the people the chance of going to the pictures on Sunday if they want to do so. Give them the liberty which they deserve, without all this discussion. Throw the places open, and if the people do not want to go to them, they will not go. If they do want Sunday cinemas they will have them, but I believe that a discussion of this kind in the House of Commons is beneath the dignity of potential statesmen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1686</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. LOGAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been wondering whether the opponents of this Bill intend to proceed in the spirit of compromise and to effect anything at all in that line. I have no interest in cinemas or any kind of entertainment, but I have just as much interest in the question of Sunday observance, from the Catholic or religious point of view, as any other Member of the Committee. I am anxious, however, that the great population in my constituency should have the opportunity of enjoying themselves, under the proper control and proper restraint and the proper influence which any particular body may exercise. I say that we should give them on Sunday that enjoyment to which they have a right, and I ask Members of the Committee, not merely for the purposes of Debate but with the object of trying to effect something in regard to general legislation, what is the object of this Amendment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I understand English at all, it means that I hear some hon. Members saying that they are anxious not to do anything that will injure any particular section, but that they want to give to the county of London the right of operating something with which they themselves in principle do not agree. They say that what has been in existence for 16 or 18 years should have the right to exist now, that it is evil but that it should go on because it has been the practice. If the contention be that in principle this should not be applied, it should apply to none at all. If it is going to apply, applicability must come to all. You cannot, if the thing be wrong, say that because it has been in practice in London for 16 or 18 years, you will legalise it and make an evil legal, whereas you will say to seaside resorts and 96 other parts of the country that have been carrying this on legitimately, that because a common informer has come upon the scene they must be faced with a chaotic state of things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe in legislation, but not in hotchpotch legislation. I am not anxious for Continental Sundays, but I am anxious that the people of this country should have this right, if they wish it, to be exercised under lawful and restraining influence, and because I find in this Bill the opportunity to give to local governing bodies that great power of censorship, I am convinced that the carrying of this Amendment would be not for the purpose
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0844">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1687</span>
of legislation, but for the purpose of opposition. If hon. Members meant what they really inferred, they would say that they were against the Bill entirely, but because they feel that the opposition would be too great and they are not anxious honestly to face the issue, they want to make the carrying of the Amendment appear as a compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been most courteous in his attitude. I feel that there is something great at stake, that there is a principle which the common informer has brought prominently before us, but we are here to legislate not in our own petty interests—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is getting rather far from the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. LOGAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members who support the Amendment say that if the county of London is inserted here, we shall be able to come along later to deal with other parts of the country, but that will not get rid of a problem that will confront many of the provincial towns. What will the position be in other constituencies in regard to concerts? How will hon. Members deal with that question? If the Amendment is carried, immediately they will not have the power of carrying on their concerts, and in the provinces concerts are held on Sunday evening for profit or payment. Then there are debates also. Do hon. Members think that by putting in the county of London they will cure the evils? They know as well as I do that they will merely increase them. I think that this is a hotch-potch system of legislation, and, with all due respect to hon. Members, I do not think they are facing the situation honestly. I think they ought to give a direct vote for or against the Bill, giving the local bodies the power. If a vote be taken on this big question, we shall know exactly the full opinion of the Committee. The question appears to me to boil down to this, that it is for entertainments on Sunday, either restricted or unrestricted, by one section here, and the other section is distinctly opposed to any entertainments at all. But this Amendment is not really tangible. It is a waste of time, and the sooner we take a vote on it the better, I at least shall vote for the Bill as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. MORRISON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will be gratified with the extent to which he has been enabled to observe a cross-section of opinion in this Committee upon this important question. It is clear that we are in a strange position over this Amendment, and I should like to protest against the assertion made by the hon. Member for the Scotland Division of Liverpool (Mr. Logan) that there is some lack of honesty and sincerity in this Amendment or in our opposition to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. LOGAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I feel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MORRISON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I protest against it. The opposition to this Bill is just as sincere and honest as the support of it, and it is only by mutually accrediting ourselves with decent intentions that we can conduct a discussion which is of any value at all. On this point of compromise, so far as it is shadowed in the Amendment, let me put my position, which is, I think, one that is held pretty largely in the House. I feel, as an opponent of the Bill, for reasons which I have stated, valid reasons, that I am bound to take some notice of the vote of the House of Commons on the Second Reading. I cannot disguise from myself that however sincere I may be in my own eyes, however convincing my own arguments may sound to myself, yet to the majority of my fellow Members they have not appeared of equal weight, and it is only by frank recognition of that position that we can discuss this question with any prospect of success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So much for my side. From the side of the supporters of the Bill, it must be clear to them that the Government have left us rather short of time to give it that detailed discussion which its importance merits in time for it to be passed through the House of Commons in order to save the situation which will develop in October. That is the position, and we ought to face it frankly; and there is no lack of honesty in our doing so. Compromise has been suggested about stabilising the position more or less as it is now. Some hon. Members opposite object to that. My hon. Friend the Member for the Scotland Division objects to it because, he says, if you oppose the Bill, why should you give this privilege to people who have defied the law in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0845">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1689</span>
past, and deny it to others? With great respect, might I offer this argument to hon. Members who feel the weight of that consideration? Stating it in that way begs the whole question of our opposition to the Bill. If this were a privilege which we were proposing to give to London and other places, there would be no sense in our opposition to the Bill, but it is because some of us believe that this extension of Sunday trading into otherwise peaceful areas is not a privilege at all, but is a detriment to the inhabitants of those places, that we oppose the Bill. Our attitude is that we have done our best to save London and its satellites from this infliction of Sunday trading upon them. We have failed to protect them entirely. Let us, with what speed we can, protect the rest of the country from the same evil spreading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the point of view of an opponent of the Bill, and for those who support the Bill I suggest, as a reasonable attitude in the present circumstances, that they might say, "I believe entirely in the principle of the Sunday opening of cinemas, and I realise that unless legislation is passed soon, a most unfortunate situation will arise in London in October; and, therefore, in order to get through a Measure which at least saves the worst effects of that situation from developing immediately, I am prepared to realise that such strong opposition to the principle of local option enshrined in this Bill exists that it is better to accept something of that character." I shall no doubt be accused, and we shall all be accused over these things, no matter what line we take, of yielding on this question of Sunday observance, but I would say to hon. Members on this side who take that view that, after all, we have to face the facts of the situation arising here. If those who might be inclined to criticise us for compromising, if we do compromise, had 15 or 20 years ago taken up the Sunday cinema question in London, there would have been none of this situation at all, and it is a little late in the day, after they have allowed the position to slide into this dangerous state, to criticise hon. Friends of mine who feel with me on this matter and have the responsibility thrown on us of facing up to the facts as they exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1690</span>
I certainly notice with great interest and, if I may say so, with approval, what the Under-Secretary of State said about concerts, debates, zoos, and museums. Clearly, they fall into a different category, and my hon. Friend the Member for Barnstaple (Sir B. Peto) put a very pertinent question. If that is the view of the Home Office, as I think it is of the Committee, about these things, there is no place for them in this Bill at all, and there is no place for them in the Sunday Observance Act, and they ought, as lumber, to be cleared out of the discussion of this question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this Amendment, there is a great deal to be said for limiting the Bill to London. The Sunday Observance Act which we are now amending was originally passed to deal with London and Westminster, because a situation had grown up in the capital which was not reflected over the rest of the country, and it was only later that it was extended to cover the rest of the country. London has great differences. One of the characteristics of London is that a large part of its population that come to live in it have not got their homes in it, and it is the home and the atmosphere of the home that makes the institutions of this country permanent and stable. Consequently, we have in London what I might call the detribalised native of the British Isles, cut adrift from his hereditary institutions, to a greater extent than we have anywhere else, and that places London in a very different category.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl WINTERTON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am going to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing before the Committee at the present time. I think it would be for the convenience of the Committee if the representative of the Government were to—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl WINTERTON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is really not fair, if I may say so. You allow the hon. Baronet to make a speech, and I am entitled to refer to it. If you will not allow me to make a speech, then I will move that the Committee do now adjourn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir B. PETO</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood that the Under-Secretary definitely moved that the Committee do adjourn until Thursday, and I asked you to accept an Amendment that the Committee adjourn until the Tuesday immediately following the Whitsuntide Recess. Therefore, there is a definite Question before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary did not move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1694</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought the hon. Gentleman merely suggested the adjournment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I moved it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then I will out that Question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir B. PETO</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As an Amendment to that I suggested that we should adjourn until the Tuesday following the Whitsuntide Recess.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl WINTERTON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Baronet, who is always a fair opponent—though I have never before found myself in the position of being an opponent of his—would not wish to deprive me of an opportunity of replying to what he said. The opposition to the Bill has been of a perfectly fair character. But I can predict, from what I have read in the newspapers, what will happen. A Bill, which will be called a compromise bill, will be brought in which will give the public to a great extent that which is the principle of this Bill. It will not go as far as some of us like. When it comes before the House, we who support the Government through thick and thin will have to make up our minds what we shall do. In all probability we shall vote for it and it will become law. We shall then put the opponents of the Measure in the position of having to vote for a principle which they have told us over and over again is a godless one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know Thursday next is inconvenient, although it is not the day on which the House adjourns. There is a full day's business, and we shall be discussing the Report and Third Reading of the Children Bill in the House. Some Members may want to get away two days before the House rises, but I appeal to them to allow this Committee to meet again on Thursday. There is also a practical point. While the Bill is still in Committee, it is impossible to give notice of the presentation of another Bill dealing with the same subject, and it is impossible that the new Bill can be presented, printed and circulated until this Bill has been finally disposed of. If we adjourned till Tuesday week, it would not be before Wednesday week at the earliest that the Bill could be available. If we adjourned till Thursday and are able then to dispose of it, it will be possible to give notice immediately, to have the First Reading

	<span class='label label-info column'>1695</span>
on the day the House resumes and have the Bill immediately in the hands of Members. This is really a question of time. By the time the Whitsuntide Adjournment is over and it is possible to have the Second Reading, we shall be getting very near what is proposed to be the end of the Session. We regard it as vital that a Bill of some kind should be passed during the present Session, and I put the point to the Committee, what will public opinion outside think if we sacrifice three or four days of valuable time simply because the Committee is unwilling to meet, not on the day the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1696</span>
House adjourns but the day before, which is a full day of Parliamentary business?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir B. PETO</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand that the meeting on Thursday will be only a formal meeting to hear a short statement on the Government's intention and to do away with the present Bill altogether?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>

	<p>The Committee adjourned at Thirteen Minutes after One o'Clock until Thursday next, at Eleven o'Clock.</p>
