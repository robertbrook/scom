	<div class='legislation'>Draft Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 (Enforcement of Overseas Forfeiture Orders) (Northern Ireland) Order 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Richard Needham)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That, the Committee has considered the draft Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 (Enforcement of Overseas Forfeiture Orders) (Northern Ireland) Order 1991.</p></blockquote>
The order is made under section 9 of the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990. Similar orders are being brought forward in respect of England and Wales and Scotland. Together with other measures, these orders will enable us to comply with United Kingdom obligations arising out of our ratification on 1 July of the United Nations convention on illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The countries to which the order applies are listed in schedule 2, which appears on pages 8 and 9 of the order. These countries are party to the UN drugs convention, or countries with which we have concluded forfeiture arrangements. Additional countries will be added as necessary by further Orders in Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present order will allow the High Court in Northern Ireland to enforce orders from overseas courts for the forfeiture of property that has been used in the commission of any drug trafficking offences listed in article 2. It will also enable us to obtain a restraint order from the High Court to ensure that the defendant cannot get rid of his property before a forfeiture order can be enforced. Safeguards are included to ensure that our courts are not obliged to act on behalf of another country in an unfair or unjust manner. The UN drugs convention, or one of the bilateral agreements, ensures that designated countries are obliged to offer us reciprocal assistance. A central authority, established in the Home Office, will ensure that requests from overseas are correctly processed in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 (Enforcement of Overseas Forfeiture Orders) (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 will ensure that Northern Ireland plays its part along with the rest of the United Kingdom in the international effort to combat drug trafficking. Together with other measures that we have recently brought forward in relation to the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking, which for Northern Ireland are contained in the Criminal Justice (Confiscation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1990, we will ensure that there is no safe haven in the United Kingdom for the property of drug traffickers. I commend the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>

	<p>4.32 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Marshall 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leicester, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister on taking us so speedily through the order. That contrasts with our performances in another Committee last week. I appreciate that the Minister may have difficulties answering specific questions, even with professional help. Another Minister, who is involved in discussions at Stormont today, usually deals with this aspect of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the order, which provides for greater international co-operation in dealing with drug trafficking. It will permit the enforcement in Northern Ireland of forfeiture orders, which are issued by courts in the countries that are designated in the schedule. We need the order as a result of the ratification of the 1988 Vienna convention against illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. I shall not ask the Minister to define psychotropic substances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If money were raised by the order, would the Minister consider spending it in a way that would help people to get off drugs? For example, money could be spent on preventive education against the use of drugs, and in the counselling and treatment of drug abusers in the Province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There appears to be a difference between the order applying to the Province and that applying to the rest of the United Kingdom. I am advised that article 2(1)(e) of this order differs from its English equivalent in that it does not refer to section 14 of the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990. I remind the Minister and his officials that that section relates to concealing or transferring proceeds of drug trafficking. What is the reason for the difference? Is that specific point covered in another part of the order?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 2 to the order shows that the Irish Republic is absent from the list of countries which ratified the 1988 Vienna convention. In view of the alarm felt by many of us about the involvement of paramilitaries in drug trafficking, members of the Committee should perhaps urge the Republic to ratify the convention as quickly as possible and introduce legislation so that forfeiture orders undertaken in the United Kingdom and the Republic can be implemented in both countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the order and commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.36 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir David Mitchell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hampshire, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his introduction, my hon. Friend the Minister used the word psychotropic. I am unfamiliar with that word. Could my hon. Friend tell me exactly what it means? Plainly, its meaning is a matter of some importance. My lack of knowledge on the matter is no doubt due to a defect in my education. I should be grateful for my hon. Friend's guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may take up the matter mentioned by the Opposition. It is something which Those of us involved in the parliamentary tier in relation to the Dail could perhaps usefully explore further the matter mentioned by the hon. Member for Leicester, South
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0674">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
(Mr. Marshall). Has my hon. Friend any information about where the Republic stands on ratification of the Vienna convention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.38 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Londonderry, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of my party, I give a general welcome to the order. However, in my uncharacteristically brief remarks, I wish to ask one or two questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is one of a family of orders, reflecting the need to make changes in the law to bring various sections of the Act into operation in the three jurisdictions of the United Kingdom. A short time ago I asked the Vote Office for the orders for England and Wales and Scotland. I was handed a draft order for Scotland which, apparently, will not pass through the House for a a few days yet. I was handed the order for England and Wales which, apparently, passed through Committee this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that the instruments for Northern Ireland and for England and Wales are shown as superseding the draft that was published in May. What is the reason for the reprinting? I assume that there was a technical error. I may be wrong, but I should be grateful for that information. We have an excellent system in Northern Ireland for examining statutory instruments. Far too often we read about mistakes in them or about their going beyond the powers that are permitted by law. This may be such an example, and if it is we should be told about it. We all hope for the day when there will be greater accuracy in the printing of legal documents, which should be accurate because they change the law. Everyone in the legal profession would then know what he was dealing with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo what was said about the Republic of Ireland. Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom that has a land frontier. Once breached, that land frontier would leave the rest of the United Kingdom wide open. A ring fence around the British Isles would need to be as strong in the Irish Republic as in Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Information about that matter, and an idea about when we can expect relevant legislation would be gratefully received by all concerned. In the meantime, will the Minister assure the Committee that there is full co-operation between the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Garda, especially in relation to drug trafficking? Snippets in the press in Northern and southern Ireland give the impression that terrorist organisations are involved in trafficking. They deny that they are involved, and paint themselves morally whiter than white, but not everyone accepts their words at face value. We are gravely worried that Mafia-type bodies are getting involved in that branch of criminal activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in what the hon. Member for Leicester, South (Mr. Marshall) said about the difference between the order for Northern Ireland and that for England and Wales. Are there similar differences between the order for Scotland and that for England and Wales, or between those for Northern Ireland and Scotland? The orders, as I said, are a family and all try to do the same thing. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
need the greatest possible assurance that they are accomplishing the task that they set out to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.42 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member for Londonderry, East (Mr. Ross) that I am fully briefed about the nature and subject matter of the order. I am surprised that my hon. Friend the Member for Hampshire, North-West (Sir David Mitchell) does not know the meaning of the word psychotropic. No doubt he remembers some of the films from the 1960s, including "Easy Rider" and "Midnight Cowboy". They dealt with psychotropic substances, which were commonly known at that time as LSD. Perhaps his memory on such matters after so many years has begun to fade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir David Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend had mentioned LSD at the beginning I should have understood immediately what he meant. I am grateful to him for his clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Leicester, South made some suggestions about the proceeds of forfeitures. As the hon. Member for Londonderry, East said, the order will cover the whole country, and it is crucial to our ratification of the Vienna convention. The matter does not apply only to Northern Ireland. However, I shall bring the point to the notice of the Home Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Leicester, South and for Londonderry, East both said that there were differences between the wording of the Northern Ireland order and that of other orders. That is due to differences in the legislation that precedes and supports the orders. For example, the Northern Ireland equivalent of the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 is the Criminal Justice (Confiscation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1990. That is why one is in the order and the other is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The re-laying of orders was due to a constitutional technicality. The Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments ruled that article 15 was ultra vires because it relates to internal forfeiture arrangements. That is why it is being proceeded with in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has touched upon the way in which legislation in Northern Ireland and in England and Wales differs, but he did not mention Scotland. Does the Act cover the whole United Kingdom, or only England and Wales with separate legisation for Scotland and Northern Ireland? This highlights the nonsense of having separate legislation for Northern Ireland—the Scots can speak for themselves—in so many cases when it would be easier to have an Act applying to the whole United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, that depends on whether it is a transferred matter. He and his colleagues are discussing that at the moment and I would have thought that part of those discussions will involve what should be a transferred matter and, therefore, the responsibility of a local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0675">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
assembly or government in Northern Ireland and what should be the responsibility of the national Parliament. I do not wish to put my small and delicate feet into that pool at the moment. I leave the matter, as I am sure does the hon. Gentleman, to our peers and betters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give a precise answer for Scotland, but the legislation that is being brought before the House covers the whole of the United Kingdom, otherwise we could not ratify the Vienna convention. If the hon. Member for Londonderry, East is not totally satisfied with that lucid reply, I shall write to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leiceser, South asked why the Republic of Ireland is not included in the list of countries in schedule 2. At the moment, no such legislation has passed through the Dail. The law commission in Dublin is considering confiscation and is preparing a report. The Government would be happy for the Anglo-Irish parliamentary body to
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
discuss the matter if it so wishes. We want to do everything possible, as the hon. Member for Londonderry, East said, to ensure that the law in the British Isles is ratified according to the United Nations convention on drug trafficking. Having said that, there is a power within the order to designate and include countries as they pass the necessary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is worthwhile and I am pleased that Northern Ireland is leading the way. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
