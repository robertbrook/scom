	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the end of our previous sitting, when I was arguing in favour of the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie), I referred to the numbers of geese and how we could achieve flexibility by using the quarry list. The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), however, drew my attention to the European birds directive, which must also be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1960s and 1970s, people had to obtain a licence from the then Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland to shoot geese, because they were a protected species. About 750 to 900 geese were shot each year, mainly by visiting sportsmen who provided a useful income to the islanders because of their need for bed-and-breakfast accommodation. They assisted the farmers to protect the crops. At that time, the total number of barnacle geese amounted to 12,000 as opposed to 30,000 as it is now. However, under the birds directive, the shooting of barnacle geese for sporting purposes was outlawed, but given the present position, that decision was disappointing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Nature Conservancy Council suggested bird scaring as a method of solving the problem. However, that meant that the geese were simply transferred from one field to the next and back again. They are wily birds and are not fooled by flag waving—undertaken as part of a youth training scheme—and other methods by which they can be moved from the best grazing land. An 80 per cent grant is provided for the bird-scaring scheme and I am worried that it costs £80,000 a year to move geese from one field to another, and back again. Given that about 800 geese
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
were shot a year in the pre-scaring days, that means that £100 is provided for each goose that is not shot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Naturally, I am delighted that we have increased the number of barnacle geese in Islay. We must not forget that that is closely related to the nesting season in Greenland. We must be flexible and as the numbers of geese increase and decline, we must react accordingly, so that such a valuable stock is maintained on Islay. With the best will in the world, we must find a compromise between retaining the geese that we all admire and love, and rectifying the undoubted damage that has been done to the agricultural grazing land, which has had such a bad impact on farming. We, in Scotland, know that not many areas are more difficult to farm than Islay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should still maintain or increase the number of white-fronted geese. If we do not do anything about the barnacle geese, however, their numbers will increase to the point of no return when there will be insufficient grazing to maintain barnacle flocks. We do not want the birds to go hungry, or to move to other parts of Scotland that they have not frequented before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Islay is not a bird sanctuary—it is an island on which many people live and work in difficult circumstances. We must ensure that they are given a fair opportunity to continue making their livelihoods. At the same time, we must maintain a magnificent flock of birds that give so much pleasure to so many people. However, a limit must be set and, because the birds now number 30,000 or more, the problem is becoming serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to wait until Scottish Natural Heritage is in operation. I want the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland to discuss the matter with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the British Association for Shooting and Conservation and others who have a practical knowledge of the subject. If nothing else, our constructive debate has shown that there is a major problem to which it will be difficult to find a solution. We must not ignore that problem nor is it enough to implement, at enormous expense, a bird-scaring flag-waving scheme, which has achieved little success. The grant of £80,000 could be used much more usefully for the conservation purposes of conservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All interested parties should get round the table. The NCCS, the RSPB and the islanders should be flexible and reach agreement. However, they should not take preconceived notions to such a meeting. All sides should be flexible, and not adopt entrenched positions. In that way a solution could be found. I appreciate that it would be dificult to include the new clause tabled the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute in the Bill, but, it may, at least, act as a catalyst, and stop people sitting on the fence and doing nothing about a serious problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I oppose the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie), I, like the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro), would like to be constructive. I have a history of interest in Islay. Shortly after the famous occasion on which David Bellamy went to the island, I raised the issue of geese
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>
with the Morrison family, which owns much of Islay, and received a friendly and constructive letter in reply. I spoke to colleagues of the hon. Member for Dumfries, but especially to Charles Morrison. If we are serious about tackling the genuine and serious problem, we should at least talk to those who may be able, partially, to do something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not do the right thing by Islay, how can our country try to persuade Brazilians, Colombians, Indonesians and many others about how to conduct their affairs? I speak as one with an interest in the rain forest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to clarify certain issues. I understand that experts are agreed that the scientific case for arbitrarily fixing a maximum number of geese is extremely doubtful. Not only the RSPB, but scientists at the world-renowned Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust agree that the problems of deciding on a number and judging whether the bird population is above or below it, are insurmountable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of barnacle geese on Islay is anything but fixed during the winter season. Earlier this winter, when the geese had newly arrived back from their greenland nesting grounds, a count of just over 30,000 was made. A later count, however, found only 23,000 which shows how the birds disperse after their initial influx into Islay. Which of those figures would be taken for comparison with a fixed maximum? How would the number of geese be reduced below the maximum? Obviously, it could be reduced by shooting, but would that work? I believe that it would merely accelerate the dispersal process and transfer the problem away from areas where fanners can be compensated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of the greater snow goose of north America, an arbitary limit of 100,000 on US number was fixed. It is a much more numerous species than the two on Islay, and, despite heavy hunting, that species now numbers 400,000 and it is rising. That illustrates the futility of trying to control numbers in an artificial way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The numbers of geese on Islay are obviously not limitless as the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute suggested on Tuesday. They are limited by the amount of food available, like any other natural population, and for the barnacle geese on Islay that food is grass. There is a remarkable correlation between the area of improved grassland on Islay and the numbers of geese. The greater the area of lush green grass, the higher the numbers of geese are able to survive the winter. The answer to the problem is for some of the grass to be paid for out of public funds and, to an extent, that is what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understood the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute to say that farmers do not want compensation, but I also understand that the National Farmers Union of Scotland has raised no objection to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reads 
	<i>Hansard,</i> he will find that I did not say that the farmers do not want compensation. I pointed out that farmers who are outwith designated areas do not get any compensation and I think that
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
they should. I quoted a farmer who said that he did not want compensation—he wanted to farm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I misunderstood the hon. Lady, I accept her statement of what she said without question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that those farmers on Islay who are receiving compensation welcome it and that those who are not receiving it because they are outwith sites of special scientific interest would very much like it. Indeed, one of the projected aims for the new natural heritage areas that the Committee discussed on Tuesday is to allow SNH to offer management payments in wider areas. I understand that Islay is mooted as one of the first of the natural heritage areas. Is that the thinking of the Scottish Office? that would allow more local farmers to be rewarded for helping to look after the nation's natural heritage. Will the Minister tell us whether there are plans to make Islay an environmentally sensitive area? That would, perhaps, help farmers in a more positive way than compensation on sites of special scientific interest. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is bad manners for hon. Members to engage in loud conversation when another hon. Member is addressing the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that those birds have a highly restricted distribution, both on their breeding grounds in Greenland and on their wintering grounds, and they are highly vulnerable to bad breeding seasons. If the arctic spring is even slightly late the female geese will re-absorb their eggs, none will be laid and no young birds may be produced that year. Just a few such seasons can have a drastic effect on populations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To fix a limit on numbers in the way proposed would be scientific nonsense and it would devalue the standing of the new agency in international scientific circles. I wonder if the Scottish Office has had advice from the international bird organisations. That limit would also put us in danger of breaching the spirit, if not the letter, of the European Community birds directive, a subject that I raised previously and to which the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) has referred. The proposal is unworkable and unrealistic and should be resisted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Wilson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this great democratic movement of ours, everyone is entitled to dissent and my remarks on the subject will be rather different from those of my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to prolong our proceedings. It is a statement of intent to say that we shall be pleased to move quickly through this morning's debates to keep to the agreed timetable. I wish neither to prolong the debate, nor to introduce controversy. However, I would not be doing my duty if I did not place on record the fact that I disagree not only with the general thrust of my hon. Friend's remarks, but his perception of the Morrison stewardship of Islay estate. I will not, however pursue that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>267</span>
I welcome the new clause. I understand the spirit in which the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) tabled it. I am sure that she understands why I identify with the views that she expressed in support of the people of Islay. It is often forgotten, because other places are spoken of more often, that, of all the Hebridean islands, Islay was subject to the most clearing—in proportional terms, more of Islay's population was driven away than from anywhere else, even in the outer isles. The population that remained did so by hard graft and by the sweat of its brow. The hon. Lady referred to the fact that part of the agricultural population of Islay is to be transformed into goose scarers, but people of Islay have not struggled for decades and centuries to work the land just to do that job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The balance, to which the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) referred, has clearly tipped too far in favour of the birds as opposed of the people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> 
	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn) agrees with me, as he is a member of the RSPB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a letter recently—I shall not say from whom—which seems to be a standard RSPB lobbying letter. It referred to the prospect of culling, but the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute said that she never used the word cull. The letter stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Could I also point out that while culling of the geese may reduce farmland damage, the birdwatching visitors to Islay run to 25% of the overall visitor population, and thereby make an important contribution to the Island economy—this could then drop if culling is allowed."</p></blockquote>
We would do well to resist such inherent green imperialism, the advocates of which say, "We will establish a new sort of economy and you, the people, will become beneficiaries because others will come from outside to admire it." I want birdwatchers to have places to go where they can see birds and pursue their interests, but it is unreasonable that any organisation or interest group should have the right to distort an area's economy or to say that something cannot happen because a new economic base has been invented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Dumfries. There is room for consensus and discussion of the matter, but let us not have any nonsense about the rights of the geese being paramount. The rationale for putting geese first is that the natives will benefit, because they can act as goose scarers or receive income from the tourist trade when the birdwatchers descend to admire the geese that have replaced agriculture. That caricature perception of the conservation movement has put other environmental organisations into deep water in many parts of Scotland. We do not want SNH to be lumbered with that image.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall support the hon. Lady if she presses the new clause, but in any case, as the hon. Member for Dumfries said, the debate has been valuable as a catalyst as it has produced wide-ranging agreement
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>
in the Committee that the balance is wrong on Islay and that its people, traditional industries and agricultural base are at least in as much need of protection as the geese.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been with the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs to Islay to see the geese and I appreciate the problems, especially as they can take a considerable proportion of farmers' crops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) for raising the matter. She also raised it on Second Reading and I am well aware of the strong feelings of the farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should be aware that SNH will have an important role of advising on the management of endangered and migratory species. That will require careful monitoring of population trends and assessment of their causes. Explicit in the hon. Lady's new clause is the expectation that the maximum population of a particular species can be determined. The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) queried the scientific case for that, but I can tell him in 1982–83 there were 14,000 barnacle and 3,800 white-fronted geese on Islay; in December 1990, there were 30,260 barnacle and 8,297 white-fronted geese.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to say whether the populations vary. The NCCS 1990 figure was an average gained from two counts. Undoubtedly the populations have increased, but it is more important to know whether they are viable, which is difficult to establish. It is not for me to judge between the figures that the hon. Member for Linlithgow quoted, as that is a matter for the NCCS in consultation with ornithologists. We have had no ornithological representations on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect SNH to consider the matter from the viewpoint of the future viability of any species and, at the same time, to take account of the needs of agriculture, social and economic development and the interests of local communities as set out in clause 3. We must not lose sight of Islay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom is already obliged to consider bird populations under the European Commission wild birds directive. As hon. Members will appreciate, because of the comparatively small number of such geese in the world the matter must be viewed in the context of the United Kingdom's international obligations, including the European directive on wild birds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That partly answers the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson). We have international obligations, as there is a great concentration of such species in the United Kingdom. If we were to adopt my hon. Friend's attitude we, as a country, might as well shut up and stop trying to persuade other people, especially in developing countries, to honour obligations. The logical conclusion to that argument is that we had better forget about great speeches on the need for conservation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advising the Committee not to accept the new clause, but I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
acknowledge that something must be done. I shall come to that later. If the new clause were accepted, it might have an impact on the EC directive. Whether or not it does is academic if the new clause is not accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not quite academic. The Scottish Office should have ascertained the legal position in relation to the EC directive. The matter was raised on Tuesday. Surely there is a ruling, one way or the other? The Scottish Office has masses of lawyers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It takes some time for Scottish Office lawyers to form a final judgment on such a matter. In any case, I am advising against accepting the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow also asked about whether Islay should be a natural heritage area, but there are no plans at present for a natural heritage area of ESA for Islay. It is for SNH and local interests to consider the matter and, if appropriate, to present proposals to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Scottish Office lawyers may be so dim and dumb that it takes them a long time to reach a decision, but my hon. Friend the Minister is as bright as a tack. He is a learned counsel, so surely he could give us his view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having been my hon. and learned Friend's junior counsel on many occasions, I have learnt not to rush in where angels fear to tread.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) that something must be done. I accept that the Islay goose scaring scheme has not been wholly satisfactory. As the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute said, for scaring to be effective, it would have to be a full-time occupation. Reasonable percentages of the barnacle geese have been contained in the reserve areas, however, which justifies the continuation of the scheme for the third year. During those three years, farmers outwith the SSSIs who have engaged in scaring have received more than £220,000 towards the cost of their equipment and time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current scheme is not the long-term answer as, for example, there remains a sense of unfairness. Farms outwith SSSIs that do not engage in scaring, however badly affected by geese, suffer losses without comparable compensation being available [

He said that SNH and others will try to find a solution, which the Minister has agreed is necesssary. Nobody should be in any doubt that I and the people of Islay care about the geese, but they care about their livelihoods, too. It is essential to find a balance.

	<i>Confirmation of SSSIs by the Secretary of State</i>—
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) The designation of an SSSI under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 shall in Scotland require to be confirmed by the Secretary of State.

	<ol>

	<li>the needs of agriculture, fisheries and forestry;</li>

	<li>the need for sustainable social and economic development in Scotland or any part of Scotland;</li>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principles of the two new clauses are the same, so most of what I have to say will apply to both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the other place exercised their minds quite a lot on the question of appeals. I shall concentrate on two points: the structure of SNH and the question of its linkage with Parliament. Under the appeals procedure, the democratic rights of landowners, farmers and leisure, recreation and tourist related suppliers must be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been assured by my right hon. and hon. Friend that SNH will be more reasonable and will handle designations for SSSIs more sympathetically, which is good news. We have been assured, too, that SNH, in its negotiations with bodies associated with scientific evidence, will be more reasonable and less dogmatic than the NCCS has been in the past. That is also good news.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman of SNH, Magnus Magnusson, has pledged that the body will be reasonable and cooperative. That is interesting because if we study the history of SSSIs, we see that there have been problems. I do not doubt that there has been excellent co-operation, but diplomacy is crucial if a farmer is to be persuaded that he must stop farming a profitable part of his land for some sort of unknown possible compensation. Following some farmers' misgivings, they have been told bluntly what will happen, whether they like it or not. I am not saying that that has happened often, but there are some known cases of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The isle of Stroma off the coast of Caithness covers about 1,000 acres and one day it was decided that the whole island was to be designated an SSSI. The reseeding that a farmer wanted to do was declared to be impossible and a loss of income was obviously involved. Although the area under the SSSI was ultimately reduced from 1,000 to 340 acres, the loss of income was calculated by the North of Scotland College of Agriculture, which is considered to be an expert body on these matters, to be about £14,500 a year. The NCCS initially offered £6,500, which it raised to £7,800. Ultimately, it was raised to £12,000, but that was five years after the notification, with farmers having to pay all the costs involved. Therefore, is it any wonder that the other place exercised its mind?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know of the notorious Alcock case in Aberdeenshire, involving a farmer who was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>273</span>
enthusiastic about wild flowers and who did his own thing. Some farmers in my constituency are keen on conservation. The farmer in Aberdeenshire was keeping cattle off the hill at the relevant time of the year, so that orchids could grow. He was so enthusiastic about those orchids that when he was asked by a friend whether the NCCS could have a look, he was willing to allow that. However, the land was designated an SSSI and a whole list of restrictions were introduced, prohibiting virtually all agricultural and other operations on the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend does a lot of gliding, he will know Bishop Hill in Kinross—immediately before it is another hill, which was designated an SSSI. That has been grazed since Adam and Eve swapped fig leaves. When I asked for a list of the fauna that was allegedly under threat, the first four were dandelion, thistle, grass and clover, which, as we spend a massive amount of money trying to get rid of the damn things, did not seem to me to be under threat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. and learned Friend is aware, I know Bishop Hill well. There is a good gliding site at the foot of the hill and I have spent many happy hours there flying around in sail planes. My hon. and learned Friend is right—that area is not short of thistles or much else for that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The land in Aberdeenshire was designated as an SSSI, and most of the agricultural operations that had existed before ceased to take place. Strings attached to conservation projects can have the misfortune of turning into nooses. Against that background, we need to consider seriously what has been said in Committee. We have heard that under the SNH in-house appeal system a SSSI notification will be examined by the experts of the Joint Nature Conservancy Committee. In paragraph 3.4.1 of the procedural notes on SSSI notification under the heading "Minor representations or objections" it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the representations or objections can be resolved at officer level we shall proceed to do so. Such cases will normally involve minor reduction of the area notified or the deletion or reduction in scope of one or more of the notifiable operations."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 3.4.2 relates to substantial objections—namely those objections to the whole or part of an SSSI that cannot be resolved at officer level—and it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where an owner/occupier or other consultee challenges the opinion that an area of land is of special interest, it is our intention to refer this objection to the Science Research and Development Board of the agency which is made up of independent scientists covering a wide range of disciplines.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Should the SRD Board find in favour of the objector, the area of land concerned will, subject to the approval of the Main Board, be withdrawn from the SSSI. It is our intention that the findings of the Main Board will be made available on the public record."</p></blockquote>
As I understand those proposals, the board of special scientists will operate on the Chinese wall principle—hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil. I hope that my hon. Friend will not be offended when I tell him that experience has made me sceptical of Chinese walls. In 1985 I discovered that the City's self-regulated appeals procedure, and the claim that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
Chinese wall system worked, was a sham. Court cases, subsequent legislation, and no end of speeches by myself in this place were necessary to rectify the problem. I remind the Committee that I am talking about the Guinness affair. Am I a sceptic about Chinese walls? Oh yes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the experts who will study the scientific evidence in the in-house appeals system? Once again I am reminded of my experience with another statutory body, the Civil Aviation Authority, which operates an appeals system run by experts. The system is flawed and undemocratic because the statutory body claims that its experts are the only ones fit to judge a case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One expert employed by the CAA was in post on 28 February but retired on 1 March, after which he ceased to be an expert. What nonsense. An air-marshal whom I wished to call as a witness was deemed not to be an expert by the CAA, although he was speaking as an expert the day before. That shows how carefully we need to consider the issue of so-called experts. Scientific evidence can and should be challenged by other suitably qualified and experienced scientists. Such a right must be open and available to those who want to appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the CAA because individuals and firms were affected by its decisions, including the Scottish Gliding Union Ltd at Portmoak, which is below Bishop Hill. It took me six years to get an air route bent, because no democratic procedure existed for doing so. People did not appeal to their Members of Parliament because Ministers said that they had no locus to intervene. Hon. Members were unable to ask questions in Parliament about details of the proposed route because Ministers had delegated responsibilities to a statutory body. It was stated that appeals about airways had to be heard in house by experts at the CAA through its consultative procedures. That is why I am rather chary about the Bill's contents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the corner-stones of our unwritten constitution is the right of an hon. Member to ask questions and to receive answers. Those rights were not met in the case of Portmoak. If the Bill is passed in its present form, those rights will not be respected. It took me six years to reverse the negation of democracy regarding the CAA and I have no wish to spend the next six years trying to rectify another democratic error of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My new clause would ensure adequate democratic accountability. Much has been said about debates in the other place, and about the fact that it is not elected or democratic. Elected or not, it is part of the legislative system of Parliament and of our unwritten constitution. It is a revising and questioning House. I believe that it does a very good job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>275</span>
The House of Commons, the elected Chamber, is an essential part of the protection afforded to the citizen against the Administration and against the delegated authority that Parliament gives to statutory bodies. Without the right to question Ministers, the democratic rights of citizens will be negated. We must not give a statutory body the right to operate without accountability to Ministers. I do not want hon. Members to table questions about SSSIs, or anything else that is mentioned in the Bill, only to be advised that a Minister has no locus to intervene. Advisers to the Law Society of Scotland told me that it is anxious about that aspect of the Bill. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The absence of any machinery for objections or appeals has already been the subject of comment in the House of Lords, and the writer's view is that it is essential as a matter of principle, and from a purely pragmatic point of view, that a system of consultation, consideration of representations or objections, and ultimately appeal in respect of a Development Project or Scheme be introduced.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In the absence of any such statutory procedure, it would appear that aggrieved persons would be obliged to resort to the Court by way of application for Judicial Review."</p></blockquote>
Farmers, landowners and those connected with the leisure, recreation and tourist industries expressed opposition to the in-house appeals system. They, like me, believe that it is non-democratic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough to say that, in future, SNH will be user-friendly. The speech by Magnus Magnusson to the Scottish NFU could hardly be described as user-friendly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 11 March, the 
	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the way Magnus Magnusson, best known as the presenter of the BBC television programme Mastermind, scored so many 'passes' in his after dinner speech. For such an accomplished communicator, he fluffed a glorious opportunity to impart the conversation message to a captive audience."</p></blockquote>
The article also stated that Magnus Magnusson,
	<br><blockquote><p>"would have been better advised to adopt a more anecdotal approach, preserving his serious comments for the punch-line at the end. At least there would have been some chance of his hosts still being awake.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Instead, his late-night ramblings simply antagonised them—and probably closed their minds to some uncomfortable home truths. He could have done with a few lessons from Mr. Major, who next morning contrived to make the painful remedies for farming's current ills sound like a bedside chat from an understanding GP.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>There was no such sensitivity on the part of the NCC chairman, whose idea of charm was to suggest that the notion of fanners as the custodians of the countryside was little more than 'romantic rhetoric' ".</p></blockquote>
That does not sound like the kind of speech that is made to win hearts and minds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman talked to anyone who was there?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not there, but I was told by those who were there that not only was the speech badly received but, because people were so hostile, it was booed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that people may think that farmers have not been as user-friendly to the land as they
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
would like them to be. We have been told, however, that once the NCCS and the Countryside Commission for Scotland become SNH they will mend their ways and that SNH will be user-friendly. Therefore, it is not unrealistic of me to draw attention to its first public opportunity to adopt that user-friendly approach. I am glad that Mr. Magnusson was not selling ideas or products because he would not have made many sales that evening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speech to which the hon. Gentleman referred should be kept in proportion. I read the account of it in 
	<i>The Scotsman,</i> which was slightly less hostile. It can be assumed that that was not one of Mr. Magnusson's finest hours. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should recognise that that might have been due to misjudging the occasion rather than to the substance of the remarks. I hope that that speech will not be cited as a reason for confrontation between farmers and the new agency. That message should not come from this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not cite the article to attack Magnus Magnusson's personality; I wish to make that clear. He is an inspired appointment. Suppose that I, or anyone else whom others might think was an inspired appointment to a job, made a speech which they thought gave offence and was not right for where it was made. There would be no shortage of people—and I think that Magnus Magnusson would be one of the first—to draw my attention to the error of my ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want conservation to work and the new body to be effective. I can hardly go back to my farmers, landowners and all those who complained to me—certainly those who were at the dinner—and say, "Of course, you realise that it will be all right. The Minister assured me that the new body will be user-friendly." That would be unrealistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one suggests that farmers, landowners and so on are not the custodians of the land, that they are not the people to carry out our wishes and aspire to conservation projects, one must ask, "Who the devil will?". Who will work with SNH once it is established if we do not set the co-operation and support of those most directly involved?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Magnus Magnusson would do well to remember—and this applies to us all—that image is not what each of us thinks we are; it is what others perceive us to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, we will think about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that that could be a criticism of us all. Given the speech by Magnus Magnusson, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister accepts that mere assurances about improving and expanding the system of informal consultation with potential clients will not be good enough—if it ever was—to stifle demands for a democratic appeals procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If scientific evidence is good enough, and can be validated, I cannot see why the promoters of new SSSIs are worried about a democratic, statutory appeal procedure. Those same people would scream if anyone suggested that they should not have a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
system of appeal against statutory matters that affected them. Worse still, most of the organisations that have given us their thoughts and ideas on promoting the appeal procedure have charitable status. I wonder how they would feel if we set up a statutory system under which they had no right of appeal through their Member of Parliament. If they could not have their questions answered in Parliament, they would scream that something had to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have an opportunity to examine the issue clearly and objectively. We are not promoting a narrow interest because principle as well as practice is involved. I hope that I have demonstrated clearly to my hon. Friend the Minister that there is a democratic need for a new clause 7 or something similar. I hope that he will not reject that need out of hand and that he will agree to accept the new clause, or at least reconsider an important democratic need. The Committee seeks assurance that the Government have taken on board the strength of feeling about what could be a vital constitutional issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we did not support clause 11 in the other place. However, I do not dissent from the principle behind the new clause. The aims of my new clause 17 are similar in some respects to the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not dispute our obligation to designate SSSIs, nor do I dispute the fact that the NCCS or SNH has a duty to undertake that role. What I do question is why a designation should be given such status that it affects other interests without the right of appeal to or confirmation by an independent body, or person, such as the Secretary of State. Although I welcome the significant step forward taken by the NCCS in producing new guidelines, the arrangement for an internal review of new notifications, independent of NCCS management, are not part of the Bill. Good intentions can get lost in the mists of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reorganisation of the NCCS and the creation of the SNH has given us a worthwhile opportunity to seek out and explain the root causes of the present polarisation of opinion on nature conservation issues and to try to remedy them. Section 37 of the Countryside Act 1968 requires that there must be
	<br><blockquote><p>"regard to the needs of agriculture and forestry and to the economic and social interests of rural areas."</p></blockquote>
My new clause would put that into the Bill so that the Secretary of State would consider it in the event of a dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The absence of checks and balances in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the failure to establish any means of independent arbitration when there is a clear clash of interests between conservation and other land users led to a loss of confidence. We regret that. The 1981 Act provides no guidance on how the Nature Conservancy Council should reach its opinion on designation. When determining the notification of SSSIs the opinion of the NCC is sufficient, so, again, it is judge and jury. Surely in a
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
democracy disputes should be settled by a neutral party, especially when, as the hon. Member for Tayside, North said, the NCC is a statutory body. As far as I am concerned, it is another quango.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years I have received repeated requests from regional and district local authorities, the National Farmers Union for Scotland, the Scottish Crofters Union, tourist bodies and so on for the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to be amended. Will the Minister tell the Committee what other countries designate SSSIs by allowing nature conservation to override other land uses with no reference to the need to balance the two?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scientific opinion may be subjective and is often open to question by other scientists. SSSIs have been denotified for being substandard and sometimes mistakes have been made. For example, on Islay attempts were made to designate the Duich moss because geese nest there, but the local people soon put the NCC right on that. It was then stated that the purpose of designation was to preserve various mosses and habitats for dragonflies. It eventually transpired that the purpose was to stop the commercial extraction of peat. That is fair enough, but it is an example of how the NCC was not right originally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People have been shocked at the vast areas that have been designated SSSIs. They are not pieces of land here and there of specific scientific interest. Of the total 2.5 million hectares in the highlands, more than 382,000 hectares are designated. On Islay alone, 32 square miles are designated, encompassing 49 crofters and farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the antagonism to designation stemmed from the protracted arguments and length of time taken to reach management agreements, to which the hon. Member for Tayside, North referred. That involved lawyers for those who could afford them and anger, frustration and sometimes fear for those who could not. I know of three cases that continued for five years. I asked one farmer, whom I was trying to help, whether he was looking for compensation. His frustration was so great that his answer was no, but he just wished that they would go away and leave him alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Badenoch and Strathspey district there is a festering problem with designation of the River Feshie and the Insh marshes. Severe flooding of more than 10 km occurred during the past two winters and the Cuthbert report, which was commissioned by Highland regional council, identified the principal cause of flooding as being a plug of stones at the confluence of the Rivers Feshie and Spey. Many representations made to the Nature Conservancy Council have been to no avail and the plug remains.

I understand that the NCC regards the confluence as an outstanding example of an alluvial fan. that may be the case, but until recent years it was subject to annual dredging. It cannot be right to allow flooding to occur over a wide area, winter after winter, where it causes serious damage.

I cited those examples, not because I want to rehearse old grievances but merely to illustrate my

reasons for tabling the new clause. I want to reduce tensions and conflict and to ensure that the basic rules of natural justice are made available to farmers, crofters and everyone else who is involved. I cannot believe that any hon. Member can object to a fundamental principle of democracy, which is that every citizen has a right to question. In this case, they have a right to ask the Secretary of State for confirmation of the substance of a decision made by the NCC or SNH.

I leave the matter at that for the moment and I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie). We should not forget that, essentially, the proposal is to confiscate the right to farm of a farmer, landowner or tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) and I are old enough to remember the case of Crichel Down when the state confiscated someone's land without a right of appeal. When an area is designated as an SSSI on a farm, Fordell castle or an estate, that involves confiscating land and sterilising it from the use to which the owner would put it. In constitutional and legal terms, that is a serious principle and, as the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute said, it raises the question of natural justice. As I recall, the first principle of the seventh commandment of natural justice is that it is wrong to have appeal from Caesar to Caesar.

I am not suggesting that Magnus Magnusson has ever stayed in anything as grand as the Agora in Rome, but I do not like having to appeal about matters in the countryside to someone whose entire life was spent living in suburban villas.

A third important point is that no people are more arrogant than scientists. I was involved in a case in which there were 47 obstetricians, 24 on one side and 23 on the other. They all obtained their grandeur in Harley street or nearby and they had travelled to Scotland. Twenty four of them said that there was not the slightest question that the defendant was a virgin and that the marriage had never been consummated, while 23 of them said that they had never inspected the private parts of a woman that had been more regularly used.

I have always been suspicious of experts. I remember a professor of forensic medicine, the late Professor Kerr. He gave an opinion for the Crown that a deceased person had died from strangulation or whatever. A second post mortem was carried out and our expert came to a totally different conclusion, pointing out that the professor had overlooked certain facts. As a result of seeing the second post mortem examination report and examining the corpse again, Professor Kerr's sidekick agreed that he had made a mistake. I asked Professor Kerr whether he thought that he might have made a mistake and whether he was willing to change his opinion. He answered, "I never change my opinion."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or, indeed, the generic opinion of the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell). I am saying not that I am a perfectionist, but that, by their very nature, scientists seem to have a certainty about their views. I still read the 
	<i>British Medical Journal</i> every week—it has forgotten that I cancelled my subscription in 1951. I see from that journal that waking up in the morning is the most dangerous thing one week and that not waking up in the morning is the most dangerous thing the next week. I am suspicious about the certainty of scientists; it has within it a certainty which the law does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Kerr told the court that he would not change his opinion then because he never did. I asked him whether that was because he never made a mistake or because he never corrected one, and he said to Lord Walker, "Need I answer that impertinent question?" Lord Walker said, "You have answered it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North has raised three principles of great importance. The first is that we are dealing with confiscation. Secondly, we are contravening natural justice in having to appeal from Caesar to Caesar, without the knowledge or the presence of any evidence, or witness or representation; it would be a secret cabal in Gestapo headquarters. Thirdly, we are dealing with the certainty of scientists, but what scientists we do not know because they will all be officials. It is a dangerous system. I have seen those powers taken in Scotland to its great detriment. I am most supportive of what my hon. Friend said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was disappointed that so many of the letters from people who wished to have clause 11 removed gave the impression that the Government had introduced it in another place. However, clause 11 was introduced against the Government's wishes after a vote. I supported my hon. Friend the Minister in the removal of clause 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some aspects of the designation issue have built up over the years. As I said on Second Reading, the new arrangement will greatly help to alleviate future tensions between SNH and the owners of SSSIs. We highlighted how potentially damaging the operations could be. A long, frightening list of activities cannot be undertaken on an SSSI. However, when they are examined in detail, almost all of the requirements can be met without too much difficulty. We could not designate all the current SSSIs. The new system will relate only to future SSSIs, the number of which will, I believe, one day be finite.

I should be interested to hear the response of my hon. Friend the Minister to my next comment. Designation does not in itself involve a landowner's loss of rights. If the landowner undertook an operation requiring planning permission, a decision would have to be made by the planning authority. If the authority refused permission, the landowner would have full right of appeal to the Secretary of State. On the issue of a potentially damaging operation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I was not present for the earlier part of my hon. Friend's speech. I accept his argument about an appeal for planning permission. However, could he explain possible compensation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, in the case of an appeal, the Secretary of State agreed to a development application, the landowner would have won his case to do what he wanted with his SSSI. However, if the Secretary of State refused an application, the NCC would have to offer a management agreement. If that was not acceptable, the NCC would have to introduce a conservation order to prevent the landowner from conducting a damaging operation. The landowner would have the right of appeal to the Secretary of State against the conservation order. The landowner has two rights of appeal: through planning or through a conservation order. Therefore, it would be wrong to say that there was no right of appeal. The landowner would also have a right of appeal against a compulsory purchase order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the SSSI system under section 28 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 is to be scientifically based, appeals should not be made to a non-scientific body. We should either make Magnus Magnusson's scientific committee statutory, or proceed, as we are doing, on a non-statutory basis. I have been involved with the NCC for many years. Our procedures and our attitudes to the owners of SSSIs may not have been 100 per cent correct, but we learn by experience. I believe that it would be better to keep the present system, together with the initiative of Magnus Magnusson, rather than introduce a new system, which would mean an appeal to an organisation that would not necessarily be scientific.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The appeals procedure in my new clause would require scientific evidence to be made available through the Secretary of State, in the same way that he receives advice on all other matters. It is important that we do not suggest that the Secretary of State cannot decide on any matter because he has not the scientific background, training or knowledge, as that would rule out most of our decisions. The plain fact is that all decisions are made with advice and one would expect that advice to be scientific, as my hon. Friend knows from his service interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the reasoning behind both new clauses and I share some of the anxieties
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
that are expressed in them, as I have studied sites of special scientific interest. My constituency contains three SSSIs, but the constituency of the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) seems to be covered with them—Orkney seems to be the only place that is worse. I understand the problems and anxieties, but I cannot accept the new clause because of its basic flaws.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The designation of SSSIs is based on scientific opinion, not scientific fact. Scientific facts are objective and based on various criteria, but SSSIs are based on opinions and so are open to value judgments. I presume that SNH will advise the Secretary of State on whether an area should be an SSSI. Therefore, a problem will arise with the appeals procedure, as another opinion will be given that might not coincide and the Secretary of State will be left to make a scientific judgment, which he is not qualified to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot think of any area in which Ministers are required to make judgments without scientific advice—that is true of defence, about which I know much—and normally they will prefer the advice of their own advisers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not wholly right, as the Secretary of State does not normally make decisions on scientific evidence, but on the consequences of such decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's new clause seems to say that various other non-scientific factors should be taken into account when designating SSSIs which is not appropriate. Something of scientific importance, such as splitting the atom, is not dependent on the weather, geography, fish farms, local communities or whatever; none of that is of scientific interest. That is also a flaw in the hon. Lady's new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The correct place to consider the matters that the hon. Lady raised is later in the process, as the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) said—under planning Acts or nature conservation orders where there are appeals procedures. The designation of an SSSI does not stop anything happening; it means only that an area is of scientific importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not being present for the beginning of the hon. Gentleman's speech, but nature called.

It should be understood that there is not only no appeal procedure, but no method of representation against the committee that decides to designate an SSSI—scientific evidence or witnesses cannot be produced. SSSIs are designated by officials who sit behind closed doors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn) attacks scientists rather nastily. We have met in the court room many times—I was the witness and he was questioning me. He accused scientists of always having strong opinions, but it became clear to me that hon. Members like me and lawyers have no opinions on anything, and change them from day to day. I make a slight aside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to delay our proceedings. The designation of a site of special scientific interest is a scientific judgment and the consequences that follow from it should be dealt with through an appeals procedure and the planning Acts. I like the proposals of the NCC for the appeals procedure, but they should not yet become part of the statute. That may be necessary later, but they should remain informal at present and we should wait and see how they pan out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->

I agreed with much of what the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) has just said. Designation does not involve loss of rights. There is a right of appeal in relation to planning matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) was not correct to say that a nature conservation designation through an SSSI stops activities. The notification of an SSSI merely ensures that the owner or occupier seeks the views of the NCC if a change of use is proposed. In other words, it triggers consultation. Confiscation is certainly not involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady raised an important constituency matter in relation to the River Feshie flooding. The NCC is well aware of the problems that that creates for riparian owners. The case could have been handled better, but we expect an improvement in future when it is dealt with by SNH. The NCC is discussing means of managing the river to reduce problems of flooding for the riparian owners, without damaging its scientific interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

New clause 17 would take away much of the independence of SNH and give its responsibilities to the Secretary of State. He would have to consult his statutory adviser, SNH, for advice on any natural
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
heritage issue, including SSSI notification. New clause 17 is therefore redundant, as SNH would already have considered the case for designation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that new clause 17 goes beyond the scientific case for designation, by requiring the Secretary of State to have regard to other factors and to take account of representations from other bodies. To place a duty on the Secretary of State to take those wider factors into account goes completely against the current basis of SSSI designation. An SSSI is notified purely on scientific criteria. To introduce social, economic and other factors would be to strike at the root of the entire system and would undermine fundamentally the nature of the designation. The Scottish Office and the Government have given commitments all along that the basis of nature conservation throughout Britain would not be altered as a result of the Bill. In particular, that means maintaining the integrity of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. New clause 17 would overturn that commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), but as I said on clause 11, there is already a right of representation against the notification of the scientific interest of an area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the present procedures, I welcome the new procedures that the NCC proposes to operate from next month, which are covered in detail in the material that I made available to the Committee. I wish to make it clear that, with the non-statutory right of appeal, two separate groups will be involved. At the first stage, the regional board of the NCC will approve or reject the case. If the case is contentious, an appeal can be made to the main board of the NCC, which would seek the advice of the Science Research and Development Board on the scientific aspects of the proposal for an SSSI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Science Research and Development Board comprises independent scientists, who are not employed by the NCC. Therefore, there will be an independent right of appeal system. I am convinced that such procedures, which will be applied sensitively, will meet the anxieties expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North and others.

I agree that Mr. Magnus Magnusson is an inspired choice. Moreover, a full and more accurate article about him appears in 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> today. It was written by Auslan Cramb, and it makes it clear that Mr. Magnusson favours more being done with the voluntary principle: more partnerships and more environmental education. He said that SSSIs are not sacrosanct, and that he would carefully consider the procedures to reassure people that SSSIs are not a threat to their livelihood. Mr. Magnusson wants conservation to start at grass roots level, and has said that he will rely on the four regional boards set up by the NCCS to help that happen. I do not doubt that he will be extremely good in his new role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend made an onslaught on scientists. In law, if a case is appealed, it goes from one judge to another. The second judge is independent of the first, but they belong to the same profession. It is especially important that, under the proposed procedure, the scientists who make up the board are not employed by the NCC. They will be independent and they will be among the most eminent scientists in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North referred to the constitutional position. The duty placed on SNH under section 28 of the 1981 Act is clear. SNH must notify its intention to, among others, the Secretary of State. Anyone can, of course, make representations to my right hon. Friend and he will take them into account before making his views known to SNH. That is an important safeguard. The Secretary of State will have a role as a statutory consultee on the notification of an SSSI by the NCC. My hon. Friend is right that the Secretary of State can and should fully answer parliamentary questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the anxieties of my hon. Friend in his new clause. We are convinced that the new non-statutory procedures to be used by the NCC will be effective. The involvement of local people, including farmers and landowners who are members of the regional boards and who have valuable experience, especially in land management, should safeguard their interests. Equally, the involvement of the Science Research and Development Board will provide a check on the scientific basis for site notification—a point referred to by the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that the Committee will agree that we should give the new procedures time to prove themselves. However, we shall carefully consider the anxieties expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North. If matters do not improve, we shall return to the subject at a later date, if necessary, in the light of SNH's experience.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall support the Government. Our debate has been bedevilled by the Lords amendment. If that had not been accepted, we might have had a better basis on which to discuss the matter. After a negative response to clause 11, it is inconsistent to turn round and include in the Bill something which, in the public perception, is very much in the same direction. I hope that that will be a lesson to those responsible for the new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intervention of the hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) got to the bottom of the matter. We are talking not just about science, the right to farm, and so on, but about money, compensation and management agreements. The matter is bedevilled with those factors. If someone wants to build a porch at the end of his house and is told that he cannot do so because some form of public interest prevails, no one gives him compensation. If
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
an area has been defined as being of national scientific interest, so all sorts of restrictions are imposed, it is inexplicable why the person should have the right to claim large sums of money. There is an inconsistency here, and landowners and some land users have become far too accustomed to the idea that they should receive money in return for not doing something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we scrape the surface, the only substantive point that was made on Second Reading about why there was hostility to SSSIs in the constituency of the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) was that when an area was designated, the planting of trees was not stopped, but grants for doing so were not available. Much of the matter is money-based rather than scientifically or conservationally-based.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman that compensation should not be available if normal land use is interrrupted. However, what if a landowner or farmer had a planning application that in the ordinary course of events would have gone through for mineral extraction? What would happen if the farmer could not go ahead and extract minerals? I know of a farmer in Invernessshire who has a problem not with the terrain, but with getting a road into the area.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is widening the debate. I am simply suggesting a broad principle. If through the democratic process it is decided that there is prevailing scientific interest in a certain piece of land the fact that quarrying would otherwise be possible has nothing to do with it. The owner cannot quarry, so it is just luck. I might want to build a skyscraper in my back garden, but I would not be allowed to do so. Why should I be allowed to claim compensation for not doing so? The parallel exists and should be drawn. We should not assume that because land is designated, the owner can claim money for not using it in specific ways or that he should oppose designation in case he does not receive compensation. However unsatisfactory scientific criteria may be, pecuniary criteria are far less acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The speech of my hon. Friend the Minister was helpful and constructive. It was the right way in which to approach the matter. I can tell him and my hon.

Anyone who thinks that a committee will not be influenced by the existence of an SSSI is not living in the real world. Of course I accept that the regional boards of and the main NCC is a part of the system.

I have a copy of a letter sent by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment. It states:

I agree. It is not watering down, but reviewing decisions. I repeat that if scientific evidence is so sound, there should be no concern about a second scientific opinion.

I was delighted when my hon. Friend the Minister told me that I shall have no difficulty in getting ministerial answers in the future. If in an answer a Minister tells me that he has no locus or refers me to the chairman of the new body, I shall cite this debate. That is important. From the outset I have been concerned about constitutional propriety and protection of interests.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a peculiarly parochial issue. I am sorry to detain the Committee, but it is not often that a constituency Member gets the chance to raise a subject dealing specifically with his constituency, and he has to take it when it comes. It is a quirk of fate that the River Tweed goes to the North sea and is looked after by the Tweed commissioners, and the Border Esk goes westward to the Solway and is in a thorough administrative muddle. I include with the Border Esk the tributary River Liddel, which mostly flows in the constituency of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). Because the last five miles of the Border Esk flow through England into the Solway, it is classified for management purposes as an English river. It has nothing to do with river purification or planning, but purely with the management of fish stocks and conservation. That goes back hundreds of years but was unfortunately continued in the Water Act 1973, the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975 and the Water (Scotland) Act 1980. I raised that issue several times when debating the Inshore Fishing (Scotland) Act 1984, particularly the key issue of rod licensing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members know, in England the appropriate national rivers authority can charge a rod licence fee for the privilege of fishing on its rivers. That does not happen in Scotland, but because fishing on the Border Esk is within the jurisdiction of the National Rivers Authority, it has the right to charge for a rod licence on that one river in Scotland. That is unacceptable. As a result of legislation in the 1970s, the river was under the jurisdiction of the North-West water authority, based in Warrington. Then the problem was appreciated and the water authority turned a blind eye to rod licensing, realising that it would be inappropriate as it was probably included in the Act by mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A rod licence in Scotland on that one river would have a serious affect on the area. Principally, the local anglers would have to pay a rod licence. Tourists who come to fish in that area would be surprised that it was the only river in Scotland where they had to pay for a licence and they could divert their enthusiasm elsewhere. It would also affect bailiffs and the policing of fishing, which is now controlled by the National Rivers Authority, with its headquarters in Lancashire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even more serious is the issue of rates. As my hon. Friend the Minister knows, the Government rightly stated in the Local Government Finance Act 1988 that where a river board was in place to control river management, rates would no longer be paid to the local authority. That was a great advantage to river management. Because the National Rivers Authority looks after the river, there cannot be a river board, so the riparian owners on the Border Esk and Liddle cannot get a remission of rates as they would if they were on almost any other river in Scotland such as the next door River Annan, or the River Nith or
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
others around the Scottish coast. This has been a serious blow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Rivers Authority realised more than a year ago that legislation provided that it could charge a rod licence fee. It would not run a blind eye, and was perhaps insensitive about the issue. There was considerable comment in the media. I had a substantial problem with the NRA when I tried to ensure that it did not charge for rod licences. I am grateful to Lord Crickhowell, the chairman, and to the NRA, for agreeing eventually that the matter be put on the back burner while we try to resolve the matter and decide how best to raise income to undertake conservation duties. With luck, that can perhaps be done by section 28 order. However, in the end, we have to accept that a river in Scotland, a large part of which flows through Scotland, is controlled by the National Rivers Authority, which is based in Lancashire. I find that unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that the NRA agrees with me in many respects. I spoke to Lord Crickhowell recently. He would be greatly pleased if the Government would accept my argument that angling control of the River Esk should be returned to Scotland, and that we should have our own river board as of right, so that the system in the 1988 Act can become effective, relative to rateable value. That way, all the money collected in Scotland could be put to the good of improving conservation of this fine salmon and sea trout river, for which there is a fine angling association which makes the right to fish in our local river available to local residents and others at modest cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised this matter frequently with my hon. Friend's predecessor, Lord Sanderson. He and the Scottish Office accepted that we should be getting the river back under Scottish control. All I need from the Government today is the will to do that. I shall not cost the Government money because this has nothing to do with Government resources; it is purely administrative. For the benefit of the media, may I point out also that it has nothing to do with the problem of haaf netting in the Solway, or with the Solway national boundary, which is something of a confrontational problem. It is purely a matter of the Border Esk river and fishing in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is so cut and dried and obvious that I do not think that my hon. Friend the Minister will resist the principle of what I am saying. I do not say that my new clause is the absolute answer. There are some weeks before Report. Failing that, there must be another method of returning Scottish river management to Scottish control through a river board in Scotland. My hon. Friend must accept my case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the considerable weight of the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) and acknowledge his efforts to secure satisfactory arrangements for the management of salmon fisheries on the Border Esk and its tributaries in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a complex matter. The Border Esk, with its banks and tributary streams in Scotland, has been included in the salmon fisheries management and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
jurisdiction of England for more than 100 years. The general principle is that salmon fisheries should be under a single administration for the whole of a river system, from its source to the sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the Border Esk is in England. The inclusion of the river catchment area in the jurisdiction of England for salmon and freshwater fisheries has been confirmed at least five times this century. The same general principle is applied the other way round to the Tweed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the anxiety of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries about the proposal to introduce rod licences on parts of the Border Esk and its tributaries in Scotland, but it has to be recognised that management of the salmon and trout fisheries are the responsibility of the National Rivers Authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NRA said last year that it was keen to allow sufficient time for consultation and agreement on the way forward. To that end, no changes in previous arrangements were to be made for 1991. We have encouraged the proprietors on the Border Esk and its tributaries to consider carefully the proposals that the NRA puts to them. It is quite clear—and I am sure that the NRA accepts—that co-operation with proprietors of fishings is a prerequisite for effective protection and enforcement of the salmon stocks in any area of Scotland or England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Involvement of Scottish Natural Heritage or some other such agency in fisheries in part of the Border Esk catchment would create another anomaly in the legislation, without necessarily securing the local cooperation which is so essential in such activity. Nor is it particularly appropriate for SNH to act as arbiter in the issue by imposing on it the duty to draw up a management scheme. It would be better if local proprietors and other interests on the Border Esk and its tributaries were to continue their discussions with the NRA to see whether a workable solution can be found under existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries to seek a solution have been most helpful and welcomed on all sides. He has provided the opportunity for further discussion here today, but I hope that he will accept that SNH is not the appropriate body to administer or act as arbiter. The issue is complex. No straightforward solutions have yet emerged. My hon. Friend the Minister responsible for agriculture and fisheries in Scotland would be delighted to discuss the issue with my hon. Friend before Report. I shall advise my hon. Friend the Minister and the chairman of the NRA about the strength of feeling on this subject in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Labour Governments have lacked support in the past and introduced some of the legislation that I have criticised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
I note what my hon. Friend the Minister said. I am sad that he said that a case has not been made for correcting the problem, as I have just made such a case. I am disappointed that he has not provided sufficient assurance that legislation could be presented to change intolerable circumstances—especially as it would not cost the Government a penny, apart from legislative time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NRA was happy to accept what I am saying. It would have been encouraging for the Minister to have said, after consultation, that successive Governments—including the previous Labour Government—have made a mistake and that it should be rectified. One way forward would be to initiate a private Member's Bill with Government assistance. I cannot accept that the problem should be allowed to continue any longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unacceptable legislative proposals, which would directly affect an area in my constituency, are being allowed to proceed. I emphasise that my constituency and that part of Roxburgh affected by the Liddel will be damaged. The Minister should understand how strongly I feel about this matter. I expect support and action from the Government as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>After section 135 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 (establishing river purification areas and boards) there shall be inserted the following section—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Variation of composition of river purification boards.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>135A.—(1) The power to make an order under subsection (5) of section 135 of this Act includes power to vary the composition of any river purification board, in accordance with the provisions of this section, in a subsequent order.</p>

	<p>(2) Such a variation order shall provide—

	<ol>

	<li>that any river purification board shall consist of such number of members as may be specified in the order;</li>

	<li>that one quarter of the members of the board shall be appointed from among their members by such of the regional councils wholly or partly within the area of the board and in such proportions as may be so specified;</li>

	<li>that one quarter of the members of the board shall be appointed from among their members by such of the district councils wholly or partly within the area of the board and in such proportions as may be so specified; and</li>

	<li>that one half of the members of the board shall be appointed by the Secretary of State, after consultation with such bodies as he thinks fit, to represent the interests of persons concerned with the carrying on of agriculture, fisheries or industry in the board's area or any other interests which, in the opinion of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>297</span>
the Secretary of State, should be represented on the board.</li></ol></p>

	<p>(3) Such a variation order may make such transitional provisions with regard to the termination and appointment of members, including members appointed by regional or district councils, as the Secretary of State thinks appropriate.'.".</p>

	<p>The amendment, which my right hon. Friend foreshadowed on Second Reading, would enable the distribution of members appointed to the river purification boards by the Secretary of State and regional or district councils, to be changed.</p>

	<p>The change was first proposed as part of a package of recommendations that were set out in the report of the first policy review of river purification boards, which was published last autumn. Those recommendations have gone out to extensive consultation with interested parties, including farming, fishing and environmental interests, local authorities and the river purification boards. I am happy to say that they carry the support of a large majority of those who commented. I shall respond in detail, if the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) so wishes.</p>

	<p>12.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying before when I preempted the flow of events, the amendment is unnecessary and unfortunate. It has an ideological edge and is part of a general trend towards removing local authority representatives from public bodies and centralising control in the hands of the Secretary of State who, under the terms of the amendment, will appoint no less than half the members of river purification boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not aware of any public feeling that local authorities have been over-represented on the boards or have misused their influence. At present, one third of the representatives are drawn from the regional and district councils. There is a dynamic within that arrangement, because there is no guarantee that the interests of district and regional councils will be coterminal. The proposal to reduce the representatives from a third to a quarter, with each quarter being drawn from the regional and district councils, is retrograde and unhelpful. It suggests that councillors have not been doing the job that they were put on the boards to do. I know of no evidence to support such a suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed by the overall reduction in numbers. The Clyde river purification board covers an enormous area of Scotland and has, by general consent, done an extremely good job. The number of board members will be reduced by 20, 10 of whom will be appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland. That means that only 10 members will be drawn from local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only local authority representatives will be affected. River purification boards require a wide range of experiences, skills, and speciality knowledge, which the membership should represent. The amendment meddles unnecessarily with a system that works well. I do not want to generate a debate on the subject, although I know that several of my hon. Friends would speak about it, and I do not want
	<span class='label label-info column'>298</span>
to impose upon Conservative Members. We want to finish our business. However, I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter, which we shall seek to discuss further on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply briefly. Our aim in changing the structure of the boards is twofold. The amendment will enable many interests to be represented on small boards to reflect concern about the water environment, which has been increasing in recent years, as was shown by the number of organisations that contributed to the review and consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot let the Minister get away with that. The membership of the Clyde river purification board will be reduced from 52 to 20 and the number of councillors will be reduced, although they will still occupy 10 places. That will leave 10 places for other interests, instead of 17 or 18 under the old arrangement. Despite the arithmetical sleight of hand, and leaving aside issues about the council, there will still be fewer other interests represented under the new arrangement than under the old one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authority representatives are important and will continue to account for half of the membership. No one doubts the importance of a strong input from local authorities on the boards. The report of the review of river purification boards, which made the recommendations, stated that councillors bring considerable knowledge and expertise to bear. The size, not the role, of the boards is disputed. It is also crucial to allow a range of opinions and interests to be heard. The role of the appointees of the Secretary of State is, therefore, not to put forward the Government's view, but to represent the interests of the bodies to which they belong. The proposed number of members will be more in line with that of other comparable bodies, such as SNH. Such smaller numbers are found to be extremely effective in the private and public sectors. I realise that we may return to the subject and debate it in greater detail, but the vast majority of the representations that we received were in favour of our proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I refer to the international obligations. First, I want to be convinced about the mechanism whereby reference to the international obligations will be honoured.

My second question is as specific as that of the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro). By what I call justified good luck and by what the Government Chief Whip calls black magic, I drew the first slot for the debate tomorrow, which is about the Gulf and, in particular, the oil slicks. Let me give an example. The red-necked phalarope, of which about 30 pairs nest in Shetland, comes from the Indian ocean for the winter and will arrive in a few weeks. Those birds, like many others, will encounter oil slicks which, on the mud flats, are two metres thick in some places. Tomorrow I shall deploy at length the report of Mr. Heneman and Roy Dennis. As this is a clear example of the international obligations of the Scottish Office, will the Ministers read my speech tomorrow and decide how they can contribute? After my discussions with the Minister's private secretary, David Binnie, I hope that they will contribute on the matters of disease and injury arising from that appalling situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I should like to thank you for the genial way in which you have chaired our proceedings. The speed of our progress is due in no small way to you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our exchanges have been robust but always friendly and I should like to thank hon. Members for the good natured way in which we have conducted the proceedings and for the clear support that they have given to our proposals for the establishment of Scottish Natural Heritage. It is always invidious to pick out any particular Member, but I should like to give special thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro). He is truly the elder statesman of the Committee having been involved in piloting the Wildlife and Countryside Bill through its Committee stage and having been closely involved as a member of the Nature Conservancy Council for a long period of time. I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of attention has been focused in Committee on individual species. The hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) is in earnest in seeking the extinction of a particular sub-group of the human population, notably absentee landowners. Far from being endangered, he sees them as a pest species and would like to legislate for a 12 month open season to ensure their extinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other Members have a wide range of ideas of the introduction of non-human species. My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) spoke of wolves, wild boars, aurochs, the brown bear and the lynx. My hon. and learned
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn) has the most wonderful ideas, which I am sure he will put to Scottish Natural Heritage, for the reintroduction of the bed bug, the flea, the liver fluke and, indeed, the woolly mammoth, not to mention alligators and dingos. All in all, we are seeking a natural balance between man, sporting and endangered species.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with all the remarks that the Minister has made, especially what he said about an open season for landlords. I thank you, Mr. Martin, for your Chairmanship of the Committee. We are grateful to everyone at the top Table for the roles that they have played and to the Minister for the spirit in which he has approached our debates. As we started with a debate about the Gaelic name for SNH, I hope that I may finish with the words, Moran taing dhuibh uile, and that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) will not quarrel with my spelling of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my Clerk, Mr. Hutton, for his guidance and help, all those at the Table, including the civil servants and Hansard writers, the police officers and the Serjeant at Arms officers. Sometimes when I become weary of all of this I take myself up to Campsie hills. During the Committee I have been able to visit Loch Linnie, Islay, Rhum and Mar Lodge. I hope to visit the many places mentioned in this interesting Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
