	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise a point of order, Mr. English, concerning two of the batches of amendments selected on the clause. The selection is such that we can discuss with amendments to clause 4 amendments to a number of other clauses. With the first batch, we are to discuss an amendment to clause 5. With the last we are to discuss amendments to a number of other clauses and to a schedule. Therefore, am I right in assuming that when we discuss amendments to other clauses or to the schedule we can discuss only those aspects which bear directly upon clause 4? If that is so, when we come to the subsequent clauses, if the first amendment of the batch has disappeared and we want to discuss its effect upon the other amendment will we have to table further amendments? If the first of the amendments on the list is carried, will that issue then not arise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly true that the discussion can take place here, on the first amendment selected. Given appropriate circumstances, I would be willing to allow a separate Division in appropriate cases when we come to, say, clause 5, but there could not be further discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows that the answer to the other one of the right hon. Gentleman's questions is "No". In other words, the limits of debate are always within the context of the amendment. The right hon. Gentleman will recollect that on previous occasions I have tried to prevent members of the Committee from straying outside the terms of an amendment, but that does not limit it even further so that we do not discuss matters that are within the limits of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case I take it that if, for example, an amendment to clause 5
	<span class='label label-info column'>606</span>
which is coupled with an amendment to clause 4 is selected, it is in order to discuss all the ramifications of the amendment that is selected, irrespective of whether they go wider than the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the right hon. Gentleman's phraseology. "All the ramifications" is not, quite frankly, how any incumbent of the Chair would describe it. I said "within the limits of the amendment".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for a somewhat loose phraseology, Mr. English. May I put it slightly differently? Instead of referring to all the ramifications, may I say "the ramifications for the clause to which the amendment was tabled, and its effect upon that clause". If we are discussing now an amendment to clause 5 along with an amendment to clause 4, is it your ruling that we may discuss the full effect of the amendment to clause 5 on clause 5? The point I seek to define will have a bearing on any amendment relating to clauses 4 and 5. Obviously the amendment to clause 5 must have a bearing on clause 4 or they would not have been selected to be discussed together. In so far as it bears upon both, I seek your guidance, Mr. English, as to whether it makes for a tidier or more orderly discussion if we discuss only those aspects of the amendment to clause 5 which have a direct bearing on clause 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is better that we have a full discussion now. If we take that course, it follows that it will have certain effects when we come to clause 5. One thing I will certainly not do is allow the same debate twice. If the right hon. Gentleman does not wish to have the debate now, naturally we will have it when we reach clause 5. However, I think it would be for the convenience of the Committee if we were relatively flexible at this stage and, when we come to the later clause, for the debate to be correspondingly limited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. English. As I understand it, we are to discuss amendments No. 79, 80 and 81. If amendment No. 79 is carried, subsequently amendments Nos. 80 and 81 are carried. If that is so, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>607</span>
amendment No. 81 becomes part of clause 5, is it your ruling that it is then amendable because it becomes part of the Bill, which was not previously the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not so. It is up to hon. Gentlemen to put down amendments before clauses are reached. Hon. Members may table a sub amendment, or an amendment to an amendment, and the process can, indeed, go on for a long time. That can be done now. We have not yet reached clause 5. But when an amendment has been carried it can no longer be done—not in Committee, at least, although it can on Report. If hon. Gentlemen do not like the look of an amendment, it is up to them to table now an amendment to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 79, in page 5, line 43, leave out from "which" to end of line 44 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Service is proposed to be provided".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we will discuss the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 80, in page 5, line 45, leave out subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>

	<p>No. 81, in clause 5, page 6, leave out lines 33 and 34 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>

	<ol>

	<li>"where it is proposed that passengers shall be either taken up or set down in the area of any other traffic commissioners the applicant shall at the same time send copies of the application to those other commissioners; and</li>

	<li>the applicant shall give any such commissioners such information as they may reasonably require for dealing with or disposing of the application".</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is simple and straightforward. It is to enable anyone who wishes to obtain a road service licence to operate a bus service that will stop in two areas covered by different traffic commissioners to apply for that licence to a specific traffic commissioner. In other words, it is a simplification for the operator of the process of obtaining road service licences. I hope, therefore, that it will commend itself to Members on all sides of the Committee who are broadly in favour of simplifying the licensing process for the operator, provided that can be done without any detriment to the passenger, without loss of safeguards to the passengers as to service
	<span class='label label-info column'>608</span>
and, where appropriate, without loss of a local authority's ability to perform its role in maintaining bus networks in its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To do that, it was necessary to frame an amendment to leave out the provisions of subsection (3). I take it that as matters stand there must be separate licences for each traffic area, so that if someone wants to run a service from one traffic commissioner's area into that of another, two licences are needed. I take it that it is also necessary to cover that part of clause 5 that deals with those procedural aspects which hinge upon the requirements of The Public Service Vehicles (Licences and Certificates) Regulations 1952. I do not propose again to go over the basis on which these regulations were made, unless the Minister raises the matter. I think that we established on a previous clause that they are now provided for by the provision of the 1960 Act which is not to be changed except where necessary to take account of the different classifications of vehicles and licensing procedure brought in by this Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I am assuming—and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—that one of the effects of clauses 4 and 5 together is to require operators to continue to notify commissioners and to go on producing those huge lists which appear under the public service licensing certificates and regulations which the Parliamentary Secretary finds bore the pants off him, but which the Minister will insist on being required under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I can ascertain, the operators appear to be totally opposed to that part of the procedure in the Bill for obtaining road service licences. If the Minister knows of any operator or group of operators in favour of the procedure which involves obtaining two licences to operate a single service it would be helpful if he told the Committee of them. The Bill as drafted is totally opposed by all bus operators, and, so far as I can see, by anyone who is proposing to become a bus operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in some difficulty because as the Bill stands we cannot talk about operators in the way that we can with present legislation. An applicant for the road service licence would not necessarily have to be an operator under the Bill, so by "operator" in that context, I mean operators and anyone who is not an operator but who would nevertheless apply for a road service licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a service operates in more than one traffic area, a licence is issued in one
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>609</span>
of the areas, which is normally the area in which the service originates. But the licence has to be backed by the commissioners for other areas through which the service runs, and that may be subject, as in the Bill—I shall have to double check that point—to the bus stopping or having stops in that area. Therefore, a commissioner for an area who is now required to give backing is capable of imposing local conditions on the granting of the road service licence, but the application is still centred in a single traffic area. I believe that this part of our present licensing law should be continued and that it is for the Minister to make the case for the Bill if he sees some merit in complicating further a licensing procedure which we understood from the speeches made by the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary on Second Reading they wanted, if anything, to simplify. We understood that they not only wanted to take out of licensing some areas currently covered by it, but wanted to simplify the procedure in some areas left within. But the Bill goes directly against that aim and is complicating an existing licensing procedure to an extent which we contend is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can appreciate, of course, that the Minister would want commissioners through whose areas buses are to run to be able to consider the effects upon those areas and, if necessary, to impose local conditions. But that is the case at present, and one that is fully met without the complications that the Bill adds to the application procedure for those who want to obtain road service licences, be they operators or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does not retain the backing system. Rather, it makes it possible for the licence to be granted by the traffic commissioners to whom the applicant would apply, subject to their consulting the commissioners of any other areas through which the service would run. It would build the safeguards that are implied in the current backing system into the obligations to consult as between one set of commissioners and another. I think that whatever system is adopted for consultation between traffic commissioners, in that will lie the essence of the safeguards for the public where they are bound up in the road service licensing procedure. From the way in which the Bill is drafted it is clear that the Minister's intention is that certain safeguards for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>610</span>
travelling public should be inherent in the licensing system. I believe that is shown in the following clauses laying down duties of the commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without such consultation between traffic commissioners no service could ever be introduced for a route involving more than one traffic area and still achieve that aim. After all, it may be that commissioners see their own areas as separate kingdoms, and that they believe that life changes when one goes over the boundary between one commissioner's area and that of anothers. But I am sure that for the travelling public the boundary is an invisible line about which they care not one jot. They are concerned that the service that they use provides for them safe, efficient and convenient travel from point A to point B, irrespective of whether both points are in one traffic commissioner's area. Therefore, the system depends upon the practical common sense of the commissioners when they consult one another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is highly desirable that one tribunal of commissioners should be given the primacy in the receipt of the application for the licence. That is not to say that they will be able to specify any conditions in the area of another set of traffic commissioners, and nothing in the amendment suggests that, but it will reduce the bureaucracy involved in the application procedure in the Bill if the applicant has to go to only one set of commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be occasions when traffic commissioners will not necessarily agree, but I believe that that does not in any way invalidate the aim of the amendment. A solution would have to be found in any case if traffic commissioners did not agree under the procedures laid down in the Bill. Under those procedures it is quite possible that an application might be made to two sets of traffic commissioners, and that one might grant and the other refuse the application. Even if they got together and consulted they might still have a difference. In that respect, therefore, the procedure proposed in the amendment is advantageous in that it would enable an appeal against the commissioners' decision to be dealt with in a much more efficient manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With a single licence, a single appeal can be lodged, and I believe that it follows from that that a single appeal would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>611</span>
refused by the Minister under the appeals system. The public interest over the route as a whole could be taken into account by the Minister when he considered the appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that if the Bill were passed and one set of traffic commissioners approved while another set refused, and an appeal was made against the set that had refused, the Minister would be able to take into account only the considerations applying to the area of the traffic commissioners who refused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Minister would serve the travelling public better if he were able to consider objectively the public interest over the route as a whole, while at the same time having regard to local details, including county council transport plans with which he would become involved, and the view taken by the different traffic commissioners on fares or any other conditions which they would want to impose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Allowing for all the problems which can arise when two human beings are obliged to consult each other, I still think that the proposed channelling of such licence applications through a single traffic area, as suggested in the amendment, is the most practical form, certainly when viewed from the point of view of the operator and I would submit, when viewed from the point of view of the local authority responsible for transport planning in the area. There would certainly be a reduction of the bureaucratic procedures over what would be involved if the Bill went through in its present form. Our amendment would also provide a better method of dealing with appeals to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the matters which arise from the amendments to clause 4. I shall not proceed to deal with the amendment to clause 5 which deals with notices of proceedings. While that is important, I think the most intelligent way of proceeding would be first to establish the Minister's sympathy for the idea of simplifying the application, or his objection to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport 
	<div class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments are entirely concerned with what happens when a service proposed by an applicant cuts across the boundaries of more than one traffic commissioner. When I first looked at the amendments, and when I heard the
	<span class='label label-info column'>612</span>
right hon. Gentleman begin to propose his amendments, I was tempted by them. On the face of it, they would achieve a considerable simplification. But as the right hon. Gentleman proceeded in his speech, it became clear that he was not thinking of a drastic simplification. He does not, perhaps, appreciate how far his amendments might go. His principal concern—and it has been my concern too—is that what is proposed in the Bill should not be more complicated than the present practice of backings and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me take those points in order. First, the amendments appear to give the sole authority for granting a road service licence for one long-distance route to one traffic commissioner. I assume that the applicant can choose which traffic commissioner along the route will be most sympathetic and most likely to respond to his application. The amendment covering the role of other traffic commissioners provides that certain information should be given to them about the applications. Clearly, that would lead to consultations because, in practice, there is no warfare or rivalry between traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it would be unclear whether the other traffic commissioners who had been notified of the application to one of their colleagues could impose any conditions in their areas. It is obviously the right hon. Gentleman's intention that they should, but I am advised that these amendments would leave it a little open to doubt whether they would be so entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the amendments stand, it is possible—though in practice it almost certainly would not be worked that way—that where a long-distance service of, say, 80 or 90 miles, stopping frequently enough to be classed as stage carriage, passed, say, through five or 10 miles of a traffic commissioner's area, that commissioner could give a road service licence for the whole length of the route, the other traffic commissioners having no jurisdiction, other than the right to be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman looks concerned about that. To judge from what he said, that was plainly not his intention. But that would be the effect of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the main problem, which is whether the present system of backings should be retained, and whether the proposals in the Bill represent a complication of the system. I hope to be able to satisfy the hon. Gentleman and the Com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0340">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>613</span>
mittee that what is proposed will, in practice, be no more complicated than the present legislation, and that it is a perfectly reasonable system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the existing legislation, there is a strange system of backings. A road service licence issued in one area, which is known as the "primary area", is backed in any other area in which passengers are picked up or set down. What happens is that the applicant has first to obtain his road service licence in the primary area, and then to obtain backings from the other—one or more traffic commissioners. The procedure for obtaining, granting, refusing, suspending and revoking a backing are, in all respects, the same as those for a primary licence. In practice, it works out that a whole lot of applications for road service licences must be made for the different areas, just as we propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only difficulty that occasionally arises is that it is necessary, under the present law, for the primary licence to be obtained before the backings can be sought. Therefore, procedurally, it is possible, in some cases, for delay to be built in because it is necessary to have two bites at the cherry. One must apply first for the primary licence, and then for the backing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, that difficulty has been resolved by the traffic commissioners in a fairly sensible way. In most cases, they hold joint sittings, and will consider applications for the primary road service licence and for the backings at the same time. Nevertheless, the backings procedure has built into it the possibility of itself causing delay, because one application has to come before the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To replace that, therefore, it is proposed in the Bill that a road service licence is needed from each traffic commissioner in whose area the passengers are picked up or set down. That matches those parts of the Bill which give the traffic commissioners sole authority over their territorial areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I first contemplated this procedure, I was concerned that it might lead to more delay and repetitive hearings. However, the understanding is that, in practice, the traffic commissioners would continue the present desirable practice of holding joint sittings in almost all cases where a route goes through the area of several traffic commissioners. All the evidence, all the representations from objectors, and so on, could thus be heard
	<span class='label label-info column'>614</span>
at the same time. Each traffic commissioner would then have full jurisdiction to grant the licence for his area. Obviously, in a joint sitting, the whole thing would be rejected or granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally importantly, each traffic commissioner would have sole jurisdiction to apply such conditions as he thought appropriate for that section of the route passing through his area. That seems to be a reasonable proceeding, which would not involve any further complications than the present practice and should, therefore, prove generally acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the reaction of people in the industry. I gather that some consideration of the proposed new legislation is still going on, because it is new and the industry is anxious to know whether this will mean a dramatic change from the present position. As I understand it, some of the operators are quite happy with what is proposed, though I am not sure that anyone has formally put on open record to us that he is happy. But I do not believe that there will be any real resistance once it is appreciated that in practice the change is fairly technical and that things will carry on much as they do at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the amendments. As they stand, it is arguable that they are vastly beyond what the right hon. Gentleman wanted, and that they cast doubts on the ability of the other traffic commissioners to impose conditions and so on. They could vest sole jurisdiction for the whole route on one traffic commissioner. Certainly, they do that. So the traffic commissioner would be able to grant a road service licence for a service which might cut across another traffic commissioner's territory and, indeed, go across much more of the territory of one of his neighbours than his own. That does not seem right in principle, and though it is a great simplification, it goes far too far if we are to retain traffic commissioners at all. Accordingly, I ask the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed and surprised by the Parliamentary Secretary's reply. I am surprised, because he relies heavily on a contention that the amendment would throw doubt upon the ability of traffic commissioners to impose conditions on road service licences for services which are running through their areas. It will be necessary for him to show
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0341">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>615</span>
us where this amendment takes away from commissioners their ability to impose those conditions on road service licences running through their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Parliamentary Secretary contending that subsection (3) gives traffic commissioners their sole authority for attaching conditions to licences? If that is so, we can deal with the matter in another way. But I do not think that that is the intention of the Bill as drafted. Beyond that, the Minister has made no real case against the simplification of the procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The power to attach conditions is in clause 6, to which we shall come in due course. But the power to attach conditions is given to traffic commissioners granting a road service licence. If we carried the right hon. Gentleman's amendments, only one traffic commissioner would grant the licence, so he would be the only one empowered to impose conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is doubtful, given the limitation of the authority of traffic commissioners to their own areas, as set out in clause 4(2), whether a traffic commissioner would be able to impose conditions outside his own area. So if, in the case of a route from London to Manchester that passed through the West Midlands, for example, an application was made to the West Midlands traffic commissioner, he would have power to grant the entire licence and have power to attach conditions to his own area. It is arguable whether he would be able to attach conditions to those parts of the route outside his own area. Certainly, the other traffic commissioners to the north and south would not be able to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get bogged down in a nit-picking argument. If that is the Minister's worry, I shall draft an amendment to clause 6 to remove it beyond any shadow of doubt. But I do not want to argue about the precise effect of words so much as the main contention of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of the amendment is crystal clear. It is to bring about an enormous simplification for the operator. It may be that the Minister has not had a direct communication from all the operators in the business, or from all those who will be seeking road service licences if the Bill is enacted, to say that they are not satisfied. But I am assured by the Confederation of
	<span class='label label-info column'>616</span>
Passenger Transport—a body which is probably as representative of operators as any other body in the country—that it is totally opposed to the procedure laid down in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The confederation would greatly favour an amendment which achieved precisely the purpose of our amendment, namely, to enable any person who wanted a road service licence to apply to a single set of traffic commissioners, provided, as proposed in our amendment No. 81, they sent copies of the application to the commissioners for the other areas through which the service would go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it the right hons Gentleman's intention that commissioner, for the other areas should themselves somehow have jurisdiction to reject or approve the application or attach conditions to it, or are they to recommend their colleagues to do that? Do they take part in the hearings? What does the right hon. Gentleman suggest is the role of the other traffic commissioners to whom the matter is referred?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that that was clear from the way that I introduced the amendment. I shall now make it crystal clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the intention of the amendment to take away from the other traffic commissioners, who will have received copies of the application because the route goes through their areas, the right to attach conditions or even to reject the application. The amendment requires that the commissioner who receives the application consults the other commissioners. Provided that they all agree and have said "We will agree to the application" or "We will agree, subject to certain conditions being imposed where the route goes through our areas", the single commissioner will then be able to reply to the applicant "Your application is granted, subject to these conditions applying in these areas." So the aim is simple, clear and straight forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary helped us in part in his reply, because he pointed out that even now, with the backing system, commissioners apparently consider it desirable to meet and have joint sittings to reach an agreement as to what is on the route. I see the commissioners continuing, possibly, to meet together to consider applications. It does not alter the necessity for that. But it enables the commissioners to consider an application
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>617</span>
on the basis of one set of commissioners, or one commissioner, having responsibility for the consultations between commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill is drafted—the Parliamentary Secretary has made this clear—an applicant for a road service licence may have to make a series of applications to a series of commissioners. Given the definition of the express service which has been carried, some very long services will not necessarily be express services. A passenger can get on at one point and get off at another point, having travelled more than 30 miles but not having gone more than 30 miles from the point at which he got on, thereby making it impossible for that service to operate as an express service. In spite of the fact that the service may have done 100, 200 or 300 miles, it would be necessary for the operator, because he cannot have an express service, to make this series of applications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman can assume that members of the Committee are familiar with the last clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a difficult thing to do, because of the confusion about the effect of the last Government amendment. However, I shall try to make that assumption, and will check it out with the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the clause precludes express service operation from an area which would be an express service under present legislation. There could be some very long routes subject to this requirement of road service licensing because they would, by definition under the last clause, be stage carriage services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is necessary to look seriously at simplifying the procedure for the operators. Neither the Government's wording in the Bill nor the form in our amendment obviates the need for consultation between commissioners if there is to be a sensible arrangement. That is not an argument between us. We are agreed on both sides of the Committee that it is necessary, possibly desirable, that two, three, four or five sets of commissioners should consult one another as to conditions that might be applied and the desirability of the route that runs through their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument is simply whether it is possible, as our amendment suggests, to simplify the process for the operator by
	<span class='label label-info column'>618</span>
allowing him to make an application to one set of commissioners, or to one commissioner, provided he has furnished copies to the other commissioners through whose areas he wants to have this service licensed, and to receive a reply from a single commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not dealt with the issue I raised concerning appeals. If the Bill is passed in its present form, the Minister's right hon. Friend has to consider the possibility of a series of separate appeals along the same road service licence route. That would seem to be one of the effects of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanation is far from satisfactory. I hope that the Minister will now explain whether it is only a technical, nit-picking objection that he has because of possible doubt as to whether we are removing from traffic commissioners their right to impose conditions. That is clearly not our intention. Our amendments do not impinge on clause 6, but if the Minister thinks that they do, when we come to clause 6 we will happily table an amendment to make it crystal clear that we are not seeking to take that power away from commissioners. We could amend clause 6 so that it would refer not only to the commissioners receiving the application but also to commissioners receiving copies of the application because the road service licence runs through their area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. The Opposition have been accused, wrongly in my opinion, of delaying tactics, but this amendment seeks to be as practical as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that no one has placed on record that he is happy with the clause. It would be interesting to find out whether anyone has placed on record the fact that he is unhappy with the clause. I listened closely to the Minister, and he may have a point in saying that, should the amendment be carried, it might be necessary to look at clause 6, with a view to putting into that clause something that would make it mandatory for the commissioners to meet together to deal with a single application. I accept that point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeking to take a practical point of view, in as much as the professional operator may have to apply to six traffic commissioners. In effect, there could be six different appeals at one and the same time or the meeting time could be different; the first appeal could be on a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0343">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>619</span>
Tuesday and the next on a Wednesday. Our amendment seeks to be practical, from the operator's viewpoint, in that he has a prime need, which could be where the service starts. All the other traffic commissioners along the route would be consulted and sent copies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we should put in clause 6 a provision that it will be mandatory on the originating traffic commissioner to consult, or convene a meeting of all traffic commissioners. The Minister would then have one appeal over the whole route, whereas, at present, there could be six.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or possibly more, as my right hon. Friend says. I have not heard from the Minister a practical argument about what may apply in clause 6 if this right is taken away from the traffic commissioner. If that is the Minister's only objection, that matter could be subsequently put right by an amendment to clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the Minister will agree with our argument. No one is saying that the Bill in its present form, or our amendment, is the Utopian solution. But from the practical point of view it is much better that one office accepts the application and initiates the appeal. Thereby there would be one appeal over the whole service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In no way are we trying to take out the right of traffic commissioners to have some jurisdiction in their area. What we seek to do is to make all that come together so that the operator applies to one office. He then starts off the chain through the whole area. The Minister should be clapping his hands, because I am trying to save him work. Instead of dealing with six appeals he would deal with one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister has some reservation about the traffic commissioners, surely it is not beyond the wit of the Committee to persuade him to accept the amendment and then deal with any misgivings that he may have by amending clause 6. That would make the position much easier, and better, than it is at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) is a very practical man, and I
	<span class='label label-info column'>620</span>
sympathise with his aim of trying to achieve as much simplification in practice as we can. What I am trying to persuade the Committee is that in the end we do not make much difference by the amendments if they have the effect that is intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with sympathy, as I said before, to the right hon. Gentleman. Plainly, he is trying to simplify, but if this amendment is a result of the right hon. Gentleman's attempts to simplify I just hope that he does not attempt to complicate at any stage. In the end we finish where we started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not repeat the arguments that I put before about the technical effect of the amendment. Having listened to the right hon. Gentleman I cannot see—and I suspect that the Committee cannot either—at what stage anybody is saving any work as a result of his suggestion. Is it any saving of work for the operators, in the sense that they have to go to only one commissioner as opposed to others?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, no. As the right hon. Gentleman has made clear, the operator still has to copy his application to all the other traffic commissioners, and he still has to give whatever information the other traffic commissioners require. Therefore, the form of the document may be different, but the operator still has to go to them all. From his point of view it does not make any difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the point of view of the commissioners, will a commissioner be spared having to exercise any of his jurisdiction? He will not, because the right hon. Gentleman still wants the commissioners all along the route to turn their minds to whether or not the route should be set up and whether any conditions should be imposed. So the traffic commissioners will still be doing the work that they did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about objectors and others making representations? Some of them might be put to more difficulty, because they would have to travel further than they otherwise would, or make all their representations to a "foreign" traffic commissioner. More practically, all the traffic commissioners all the way along the route—if I understand the gist of what the right hon. Gentleman said—would have to hear whatever representations and objections were forthcoming from their particular areas. It seemed clear that the right hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0344">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>621</span>
Gentleman was anticipating that this was the case, but in the end they would still have to attend the hearing so that they could hear all the evidence and representations in so far as they affected their jurisdiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am left with the feeling that nobody at any stage has had anything simplified for him. When it comes to appeals to my right hon. Friend, it is right that the technical form would change, as the right hon. Gentleman suggests. It would be an appeal against one road service licence; as we suggest it, it would be an appeal against several. But it is still obviously an appeal against several—it would be treated as one and the same case unless it was an appeal merely about conditions in one area. The appeals would be considered together as one appeal by the Minister. In practice, therefore, the amendment would make no difference whatever in its effects on any of the essential people involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman and I are in serious danger of accusing each other of quibbling. But we are also in danger of having a highly technical debate about something which in practice will not make the slightest difference to anybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that what we propose in the Bill is a neater way of doing it: that there is a separate road service licence in each area where a traffic commissioner has jurisdiction because the service picks up or sets down within his territory. In practice, as I have said, I very much hope that traffic commissioners would hold joint sittings. If for some reason rivalry broke out between them and they failed to hold joint sittings and began to hold separate sittings, there is a regulation-making power that could be used to ensure that they did start to hold joint sittings to prevent waste of time and money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, what we propose is a tidying up of the present arrangements, with the end result of one hearing being held by all the commissioners whose areas are affected, each of those commissioners having his complete and proper jurisdiction to issue a road service licence where his stretch of territory is affected by the route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having listened with great care to what the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend have said, I cannot see that it is worth struggling to make purely technical changes which in practice would produce no simplification at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chair is in danger
	<span class='label label-info column'>622</span>
of accusing both the right hon. Gentleman and the Parliamentary Secretary of what the Parliamentary Secretary suggested they might accuse each other of.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will have observed, Mr. English, that the Parliamentary Secretary is stating that I want the commissioners in each area to be able to attach conditions to any service that runs through their areas. It is not what I want that I am debating but what the Government are proposing. There is nothing in the Bill which takes away those rights from the commissioners. What I sought to do. I hope in a constructive way—was to avoid arguing about something that the Government had proposed and which I did not seek to alter by the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not help the argument for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that I am the one who wants the commissioner to have all these rights to impose conditions. This is not the argument that is involved in the amendment anyway. As I understand it, the argument involved in the amendment is that the Government want the commissioners to have those powers—I am not seeking to alter that fact in these amendments—while I am seeking to alter the method of application for the road service licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Parliamentary Secretary thinks that it is highly desirable that there should be one common hearing and that the commissioners should get together with all the objectors, all well and good. That is not determined precisely by the Bill or the amendment. I can only suggest to the hon. Gentleman that his aim as he has defined it, or the situation that he says is desirable, is more likely to come about if the amendment is carried than if it is not. If the amendment is carried, there is a primacy of responsibility of a single commissioner and an obligation on him to consult the other commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those other commissioners want to listen to objectors separately, in so far as those objectors are objecting only to something that applies to their area, they will be able to do so under the amendment. They will be able to do so under the Bill. That is not the aspect that is changed. The sole important change resulting from this group of amendments is a responsibility on a commissioner to consult the other commissioners and to give a reply to an applicant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is desirable and will bring about a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>623</span>
reduction of a very bureacratic procedure which is laid down in the Bill. It will certainly simplify appeals. The Minister may say that he wants to look at the five appeals as a single appeal, but he may be in a legal difficulty. If there is a right of appeal against the objection of a single commissioner, he may have to consider the appeal in that way. He is not a free agent, but is bound by the wording of the Bill if and when it becomes an Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is arguable whether the Minister would be able to do what he wanted to do if he rejected the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 73, in page 6, line 13, leave out '£200'and insert'£500'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move the amendment because a £200 fine for the offence is totally insufficient. That is the basis of our argument. I should like the Minister to tell us how the figure of £200 has been reached. Presumably a figure was taken from an earlier Act and updated to take account of inflation, and so on.

The grounds of the amendment touch on some of the points that were brought out in clause 3. Regrettably, I was absent from our last sitting but I have endeavoured to read as much of the report as possible. I do not want to stray into that debate, but there will be some overlap because of the difficulty that arises over express services and stage carriage services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was argument, in what appears to have been, in parts, quite a confusing debate on clause 3, about precisely what "express service" meant under certain conditions. It was stated that there were times when an express service might well stray into a stage carriage service area, either accidentally or even—in some odd cases—quite deliberately. In any event, the argument centred round the figure of 30 miles and a number of related matters.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. English, I shall endeavour to do that. The substance of my argument is that the express carriage stipulations will be easily evaded. It will not be possible very often to check whether that is happending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the weekend I spoke to a substantial private operator in Suffolk, who reminded me at one stage of our conversation that he was operating the 1930 regulations before I was born. He told me that he believes this to be a dreadful Bill, and that the only point of optimism for him is that he will be retired by the time it comes into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He said that the stipulations on express carriage service will be evaded. In that case, and if it will be difficult to find out
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0346">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>625</span>
whether people are being dropped at points A, B or C without an army of snoopers, the only alternative is a large deterrent to the operator, which will discipline him into observing the regulations and do what this part of the Bill intends. The burden of my argument is that £200 is too small an amount. Because it will be difficult to police the regulation, the size of the fine must be substantial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is exactly what puzzles me. The offence is that of running a stage carriage service without a licence, not an express carriage service. It seems to me that the question of evading the conditions of an express carriage service does not arise at this stage of our debate. If someone runs a stage carriage service, whether it purports to be an express carriage service is irrelevant. I repeat, the offence is that he is running a stage carriage service without a licence. The only question involved is whether the fine should be suggested in the hon. Gentleman's amendment or that in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that I am not doing well on this amendment. All I proposed to argue was that a fine of £200 was insufficient, because requirements that were laid down earlier in the Bill did not give sufficient safeguards if someone were running what in practice was a stage carriage service, but which was masquerading as an express service. Therefore, the size of the fine would be the stick to regulate that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having read the report of the previous debate, I conclude by suggesting that, instead of imposing complicated distant regulations, with fines if they are evaded, would it not have been simpler to stick to the old minimum fare and to adjust that for inflation, instead of the fine? I did not see any argument at length from the Parliamentary Secretary to that effect. However, I believe that the figure is insufficient, and I hope that it will be increased to £500.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make two submissions on the amendment, which has been moved by my hon. Friend in a manner that makes its purpose clear. First, the offence that we are discussing is serious, and I shall explain later why that is. Secondly, given that it is a serious offence, a £200 fine is paltry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it is a serious offence—in some ways a more serious one than
	<span class='label label-info column'>626</span>
failure to obtain a road service licence is at present—because the effect of the Bill is to put the road service licence in a different category. The licence applies to that part of the system subject to quantity licensing. That part of the system will now be different, narrower in many senses, as a result of the Bill than it is in existing law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The road service licence only bites—if I may so express it—in a certain area of operation of stage carriage licensing. In so far as it does bite in that area, it is undeniably the major control of the number of services run, the way in which they may be operated, the routes along which they may be run and where they may stop along the route. If someone runs a stage carriage service in the narrow area covered by the quantity part of the system, without a licence, it is implicit that an attempt is being made to avoid all the controls. Given the proposition in the Bill that licences are necessary, those are extremely important controls. In that sense it is an important offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is accepted that we are talking about an important offence by someone who could be operating in any part of the country, the question arises whether £200 is an appropriate fine. I say that it is not. The figure of £200, like any other figure of course, could be eroded by inflation. But that is not part of my argument. Considering other penalties that are imposed for breaches of important areas of statute law, £200 is not an adequate penalty. A person who has not obtained a road service licence has not laid himself open to conditions that can affect not only the public interest in the broader sense, but public safety as well. The fine is paltry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The Minister of Transport 
	<div class='member'>(Mr. Norman Fowler)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must disappoint the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) straight away by saying that I do not intend to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me first explain the situation. Clearly the first point, as the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) acknowledged, is that the Government are specifying a fine of £200. The maximum penalty under the 1960 Act for operating without a road service licence is £100. That sum was inserted by the Road Traffic Act 1974. The maximum penalty is therefore doubled by the Bill. I remind the Opposition that the Labour Government made no change in the 1978 Act. It is open to them to argue, as I am sure that they will, that it is more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0347">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>627</span>
important to tackle the matter in this Bill than it was in the 1978 Act. Nevertheless, the point remains that we are doubling the penalty—a course that was not taken by the Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ipswich made a fair point. I accept that all such decisions are balance decisions. I do not pretend that arguments such as he constructed cannot be advanced, on the subject of this offence or any other. But I remind him of the history. In 1977 the Labour Government brought in the Criminal Law Act. That aimed to bring about a massive simplification and tidying up of penalties. It was welcomed by both sides of the House. It was long overdue. The penalty position in many areas was in a complete muddle. All credit is due to the Labour Government that the Criminal Law Act 1977 tackled that muddle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result, all summary penalties have been allocated, after discussion with the Home Office, in accordance with the new four-point scale of fines for summary offences established by the Criminal Law Act. The four points of the scale are £50, £200, £500 and £1,000. The penalty chosen for a particular offence reflects not only its intrinsic gravity but also its comparable gravity in relation to other areas of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Summary offences punishable by a maximum fine of £200 are normally those arising from conduct that is, for example, prejudicial to property, or to the interests of the community at large, and which comprises a failure to comply with statutory provisions. The penalties under clause 4(5) are therefore in line with those for similar types of offence in a variety of statutory provisions. The Bill attaches the same penalty to contravention of operators' licence conditions and failure to give the required notice or publish particulars of a stage carriage service in a trial area. To increase the penalties would throw them out of line not only with other penalties in the Bill but also with penalties in other areas of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the suggested maximum of £500, the Government consider that the offences in question are not serious enough to attract such a penalty. That is because the £500 maximum penalty is normally reserved for offences involving either a serious element of dishonesty—for example, supplying false particulars in relation to fare changes—or important
	<span class='label label-info column'>628</span>
safety issues—for example, operating without an operator's licence. In those areas, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, there is a £500 maximum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate, and have a certain amount of sympathy with, the arguments of the hon. Member for Ipswich and the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness. But we take the view that, in line with the Act passed by the Labour Government and with the spirit which prompted it, these offences are not sufficiently serious to attract a £500 penalty. That penalty is reserved for the type of offence that creates a potential threat to public safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, operating without an operator's licence attracts a penalty of £500, whereas the penalty for operating without a road service licence is only £200. The same safety issues are clearly not involved. I should not wish to bring about a situation in which an operator could be fined the same amount for failing to carry copies of fares and timetables on his buses as for operating a bus without a certificate of fitness. That would not be sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with the point fairly made by the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman, but it is a balance decision. I hope that they will agree that it is in line with the policy of the Labour Government—it was by no means a controversial policy—to try to bring some sense and consistency to the laying down of criteria for fines and to extricate ourselves from the muddle which prevailed before the Criminal Law Act 1977. There must therefore be consultation with the Home Office on all Bills which pass through the House, and consistency between one offence and another, and one Bill and another. We have doubled the fine. I assure hon. Members that that is sufficient, and that to go further would be to make nonsense of the policy of the Criminal Law Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As you have said, Mr. English, there is a similarity between this and the last amendment in that a penalty is increased from £200 to £500 in connection with an area of operation which is or should be under a road service licence. But at that point the two amendments part company and become very different indeed, because this penalty is not concerned—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The similarity to which I referred was not that of the subjects or the subsections. The similarity that I mentioned was that the debate must inevitably be limited. It may be different in content, but it must be limited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully accept that, Mr. English. I hope that nothing I have said implied that that I took a different view or in any way demurred from your ruling on the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 74 is concerned with people who have obtained road service licences to which conditions are attached and have then proceeded to set up a service which breaches the conditions. I think that I can deal with this in a simple and straightforward way, without any reference to the amounts concerned other than the one made by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distinction drawn in our law between offences which are appropriate for a higher or a lower fine depends very much upon whether the breach involved is a matter of public safety. I agree 100 per cent. with the Minister on that, partly indeed because it helps me in moving the amendment. The provisions concerned deal with public safety. Therefore, on the logic of his own statement, the Minister must accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with breaches of conditions which can be attached directly in the interests of public safety—not just the safety of able-bodied people but also the safety of disabled people using stage carriage services. It therefore follows from what the Minister has said that he has no option but to accept his own logic and therefore the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>630</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again I must disappoint the right hon. Gentleman. I repeat that it is a balanced decision. He is entitled to take his view if he wishes. First, however, I remind him that the position here in terms of penalties is exactly as it was on the previous amendment. The maximum penalty was again £100, and again, the Government have doubled the penalty. There is therefore no question whatever but that we have sought in this way to mark the gravity of the offence. Here, however, we are dealing with much the same issues as on the previous amendment. For example, one of the conditions in clause 6 specifies the carrying of copies of timetables and fare tables as one of the conditions that could be laid down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to detain the Committee, as I believe that this is a matter of balance for the Committee to decide. I will explain, however, what we have decided and what we would advise. We believe that operator licensing raises fundamental issues of public safety. We therefore advise that in a case of that kind a penalty of £500 would be appropriate. In the case of a breach of conditions, however, we believe that by effectively doubling the present maximum penalty we have moved as far as is necessary in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again I must tell the right hon. Gentleman that the Home Office has been closely consulted on this. I should like to be open with the Opposition Front Bench and tell them exactly what we have done. The Home Office, of course, has sought to compare this fine with other fines and to achieve the kind of consistency to which I have referred. I believe that to increase the level to £500 would be to break with consistent policy in regard to maximum fines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore advise and, indeed, urge the Committee that this, again, is an offence to which the £200 maximum fine is appropriate. We have doubled the penalty. I do not believe that a case has been made out to go further than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must appeal to the Committee against the Minister. Not 10 minutes ago, when addressing the Committee on amendment No. 73, he clearly said that the distinction that he drew between the need for a £200 fine or for a higher fine was whether public safety was involved. Here it is quite clear that public safety may be involved in the conditions attached to the licence. The Minister may
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>631</span>
have overlooked that. The Home Office may have overlooked it. But the Opposition have not overlooked it. It is clear and beyond argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 6(1) makes it clear beyond peradventure that among the conditions that the commissioners must take into account in deciding on the licence and the conditions that they may attach is a general condition
	<br><blockquote><p>"for securing the safety and convenience of the public, including persons who are disabled."</p></blockquote>
The safety of disabled persons may therefore be affected by a breach of the conditions attached. That is a clear issue of public safety. On the Minister's own definition, therefore, this must surely be appropriate for the higher fine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I urge the right hon. Gentleman to read the clause with some care. I have already said that when it comes to operator licensing and the whole issue of operating unsafe vehicles, we have that aspect very firmly on board and we have already moved to that position. The kind of conditions involved here, however,
	<br><blockquote><p>"generally for securing the safety and convenience of the public, including persons who are disabled",</p></blockquote>
whilst they are clearly important issues, are not safety issues of the same scale as those involved in operating unsafe vehicles. I believe that there is everything to be said for seeking to make that distinction in our legislation. I agree that the subsection refers to safety. If the amendment were accepted, however, one effect would be, for instance, that a breach of the condition
	<br><blockquote><p>"that copies of the timetable and fare-table are carried and are available for inspection in vehicles used on any such service"</p></blockquote>
would also attract a maximum fine of £500. If the condition
	<br><blockquote><p>"that passengers are not taken up or are not set down except at specified points"</p></blockquote>
is breached, a maximum of £500 would again apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot persuade the right hon. Gentleman, but I can seek to give him my guidance, for what it is worth. My advice is that the kind of safety issues involved here fall within those paragraphs of the subsection rather than into areas of operator licensing and operator safety. In the Bill we have sought to distinguish as much as we possibly can the major areas of public
	<span class='label label-info column'>632</span>
safety—whether vehicles are being operated in a safe manner—on which I believe that all members of the Committee are determined and agreed. But I urge on the Committee that the other conditions mentioned in clause 6 are not such that in the consistent policy of setting maximum fines they should attract a maximum of £500. I hope that that has explained the position. I accept that the right hon. Gentleman may consider that unsatisfactory, but we and the Home Office have looked at the matter and I must advise the Committee that we can go no further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has introduced matters which, with the greatest respect, are totally irrelevant to the amendment. The amendment does not touch upon whether the vehicle is safe, upon whether it has brakes or whether the seat may drop out of the bottom or remain in the bus. That is covered by another part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not even touch upon whether the driver is blind in one eye and cannot see very well out of the other, or is fit to drive. We are considering here the safety conditions that can be attached to the way in which buses are operated. So we are dealing with specific conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is perfectly true. But, to be fair, I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that on the first, there is already provision in the Bill for a maximum fine of £500.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly there are provisions affecting the standard of the vehicle and the way it is maintained. They are in another part of the Bill, and before we finish our discussions we might even decide that there are, or can be included, provisions dealing with driver safety. But here we are dealing with conditions which attach, to the road service licence as to how the service is operated, and clearly these embrace the safety of able-bodied and disabled passengers using the buses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's comments about other conditions, some of which have no relevance to safety. It might be that one of the conditions requires the posting of the timetable at every bus stop on the way. The operator may fail to do that and it is a much less serious offence, I admit. We are considering the scale of fines. I think it important that the courts, when they are called upon to give rulings or make decisions as to how important a breach
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>633</span>
of this part of the Bill is, should have the scope to distinguish and impose a comparatively small fine for a breach of conditions which inconveniences a member of the public but does not hazard life and limb, and a heavy fine for one which does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case is almost unanswerable. Where we are dealing with conditions affecting public safety that scope should be open</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 46, in page 6, line 21, leave out from "offence" to end of line 26.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 48, 50, 59 and 60.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This collection of Government amendments is of a fairly technical but, I hope, uncontroversial nature which should not delay the Committee for long, because I know that we are anxious to have a debate on clause stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sole effect of the amendments, taken as a group, is to give clear statutory authority for the long-standing practice of traffic commissioners of giving, in certain circumstances, dispensations from conditions for road service licences. It has long been the practice that traffic commissioners give dispensation from compliance with conditions. That practice is referred to in previous Acts. In the 1960 Act, there are references to granting dispensations, but there has never been a formal statutory basis for doing so. In order to avoid doubt, clarify that practice and give it a proper legal form, I invite the Committee to add to the Bill at the various stages indicated the necessary references to dispensations and the circumstances in which they can be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first amendment arises in clause 4, hence our debate at this point in the Bill, because, subsection 7 provides one defence to a prosecution for operating a road service licence in breach of a condition</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>634</span>

	<p>to the courts, and I am reasonably confident that the courts would use it intelligently.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes, 7 Noes, 9.</p>

	<p>that the person shall
	<br><blockquote><p>"prove that compliance with the condition in question had been dispensed with by the traffic commissioners for the traffic area in which the offence is alleged to have been committed".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>That ought to be followed up by references to dispensations, making it obvious what is meant, which is what the amendments do.</p>

	<p>It is important to make clear the circumstances in which these dispensations can be granted. Before granting a dispensation, commissioners must be satisfied that the conditions being dispensed with would be unduly onerous in practice if the operator continued to comply with them.</p>

	<p>The dispensation may be granted also because of unforeseen circumstances—something, which arose which was not contemplated when the commissioner first imposed the conditions. Also, the granting of a dispensation should not be against the public interest. This is an underlying policy them of the Bill but it is best discussed when we come to clause 5 and the granting of main licences. The other important factor about dispensations—this is again in the text of the amendments—is that they may be only temporary.</p>

	<p>The kind of situation that would arise is where there have been major roadworks on a route where a licence has been granted and it is impracticable for buses to continue to operate along it. A temporary dispensation would then be granted, as is now the practice, to allow the operator to continue for the time being to dispense with the condition that he travels along a particular section of the route and picks up and sets down at specific points. Temporary arrangements can be made to go around a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0351">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>635</span>
small diversion to avoid the roadworks.</p>

	<p>Other unforeseen circumstances can arise. In practice, it has proved necessary—and never controversial—for commissioners to give this kind of dispensation. We are putting that in proper legislative form. I hope that that will commend itself to the Committee, because I am unaware of any outside interest group or person who objects.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At first glance, these Government amendments appear somewhat technical, particularly amendments Nos. 59 and 60 which relate to schedule 5 allowing for the dispensation principle, to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred, and which primarily relate to community buses. They concern the dispensation of licences that have been granted in this case to community buses under the respective legislation. That is fairly straightforward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendments Nos. 48 and 46, the Minister has given us some indication of the rather technical reasons for dispensation. These difficulties arise when one does away with an old system, which is guaranteed by a comprehensive licensing system, and begins to introduce—not total freedom, as may be the declared aim—but some form of free areas in which competition and the free forces will be allowed to apply without licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have several questions to ask, particularly in relation to amendment No. 46. The Minister says that it will be a defence to show that the dispensation has already been granted by the traffic commissioners. That means, I assume, that when licences have been given to a number of operators it will be a defence for one of them to show that since dispensation has been given to the others, he, although not having had dispensation, is not in breach of the conditions of the licence. Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell the Committee what subsection (8) means? It indicates that perhaps there are certain conditions which could have been imposed by local authorities under the Road Traffic Act 1930. Does that have any relevance to the deletion proposed in amendment No. 46?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be made clear that while amendment No. 48 is primarily concerned with clauses 5, 6 and 7, it relates to the granting of licences. The major debate here could well be on public interest, but I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary, that while we could take the opportunity
	<span class='label label-info column'>636</span>
of these amendment to debate the definition of public interest, we should resist that temptation. The definition of public interest, as seen by the Government, is contained in clause 5. It is a much more limited definition, and is therefore very different from the definition of public interest as laid down in the 1960 legislation. We shall seek to debate that substantial difference on clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We leave alone the attachments on the considerations for dispensation in regard to public interest. It is fundamental to the thinking of the commissioner in determining whether a dispensation shall be given, either in respect of conditions regarding public interest or conditions regarding fares, because dispensations are allowed in clauses 6 and 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The logic of the argument seems reasonable—that where a dispensation has been given by commissioners previously in considering licences, it is not necessarily recognised in law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not fully understand why that should be. Presumably the commissioner was authorised to allow dispensation in very obvious cases. In the example given by the Parliamentary Secretary route A could not be used because the road had been dug up. Therefore, the route given and the condition in the licence could not be complied with, and the dispensation could be granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerns us is whether the criteria of dispensation considered by the Parliamentary Secretary may be different from those considered by the commissioners, leaving aside the public interest. Are dispensations, for example, considered in relation to safety matters? I presume that the argument may be that the public operator's licence is one where quality licensing will be controlled by the commissioner. But will the traffic commissioner have room to offer dispensation in relation to safety requirements of the vehicle?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill makes clear that one cannot have a licence unless one has an operator's licence and from that follow certain conditions, one of which is safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These conditions mainly concern matters such as route areas. Subsection (7) deals primarily with fares and I wonder whether the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us what the dispensation on fares will involve. Presumably it applies if licences have been granted to two operators on one route under these new definitions of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>637</span>
public interest, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the present system the traffic commissioner takes into account whether there is duplication of service. In the new provisions he has to take into account a much more restricted interpretation of that, so competition, as desired by the Government as an objective of the Bill, may be introduced into stage carriage areas if it is shown to be in the public interest. "Public interest," particularly in the interpretation of this Bill, may be that the fares may be cheaper than at present, in the sense that cross-subsidisation will not be the most important conditioning factor to influence the commissioner in the grant of a licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary-Secretary has not told us whether dispensations will be allowed either for the reduction or increase of fares, and in what conditions that would occur. We are primarily talking about stage carriage areas, having reduced the requirement for express and tour licences. While we understand the road being up and the route not being complied with, it is not too clear why this argument for dispensation should be allowed in a clause dealing primarily with fares. I shall therefore be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary can clarify this dispensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by dealing with one or two matters which are not covered by amendments. Subsection (8), to which the hon. Gentleman referred, does not have any application to conditions on road service licences. Its purpose is to make clear that the requirement of subsection (1) that a road service licence is required for any stage carriage should over-ride any provisions of part V of the Road Traffic Act 1930 or any similar Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those references are to one or two private Acts and the 1930 Act, which give certain municipal authorities the right to run bus services. Some municipal authorities derive their right to run bus services from past legislation. But just to make it clear, they still need a road service licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first example which the hon. Gentleman gave was not quite right. He said that a condition might have been dispensed with for other operators on the same route. It will be a defence only if the operator's own licence, subject to conditions, had that condition dispensed with. Before one goes on a route, or shares it
	<span class='label label-info column'>638</span>
with another operator, a road service licence will be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill makes clear, it will be possible for the traffic commissioners to attach conditions to those licences. It will, therefore, be an offence under subsection (6) to operate in breach of the licence, and penalties are laid down. To operate in breach of the licence will be an offence, unless the operator can show that he has been given a dispensation from the conditions on his licence. This sets down, as I have said before, the criteria on which the traffic commissioners can give such dispensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where there is a problem on a route which affects all operators, presumably they will all be given the same dispensation, for as long as necessary to move a stop, divert the route or whatever obstacle there may be. There would not be a power that I can contemplate whereby any safety requirements could be waived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4(4) makes it clear that a road service licence does not have effect at any time when the holder does not also have a PSV operator's licence. That is not a condition, but the road service licence does not enable the operator to operate a service unless he has an operator's licence. There can be no question of that being waived under these powers. The safety requirements by and large flow from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some occasions when the conditions attached to the road service licence, affecting the way in which the route is operated, have a safety implication—picking up or setting down too near junctions, for example. It would be highly unlikely that the traffic commissioners would allow a dispensation to prejudice safety, but the provision about not granting a dispensation if it would be
	<br><blockquote><p>"against the interests of the public"</p></blockquote>
would plainly cover such a situation. If the traffic commissioners thought that the dispensation sought would adversely affect public safety, they would find no difficulty in deciding that it was
	<br><blockquote><p>"against the interests of the public".</p></blockquote>
I agree with the hon. Member that "the interests of the public" are best considered on the much more substantial occasion when the phrase occurs under clause 5, but we all agree that part of the phrase must comprise, among other things, public
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0353">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>639</span>
safety and traffic safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Gentleman asked for an example of a situation in which a dispensation from a condition on fares might apply. One has to stretch one's mind to contemplate such an occasion, but we shall discuss fare control when we reach clause 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is envisaged is that in a limited number of cases the traffic commissioners will still attach conditions on fares to their road service licences, so that should there be a road service licence where the traffic commissioners have decided to attach such conditions on a route where there is more than one operator, all operators will have the same fare conditions applied. That is likely to occur because it might be decided that to avoid destructive under-cutting of fares on a long-distance route conditions will be applied along shared routes or common sections of route. Should one operator be granted a fares increase, the traffic commissioners might allow the other operator a temporary dispensation to bring them both immediately into line with the fares allowed, because it would be accepted that the same arguments applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be a temporary dispensation; to have a permanent increase the operator would have to apply for a variation, and such a temporary dispensation would normally be given on the understanding that the other operator would immediately apply for a fares increase to move into line on a permanent basis with the other operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by making clear that dispensations are only temporary. There is no question of these powers to grant dispensations being used to make permanent changes in the way in which the services are operated or fares are charged. There are separate provisions in the Bill allowing for variations to be made or conditions to be removed, and those procedures will have to be followed. These are temporary variations for unforeseen or seen circumstances where enforcing the conditions for the immediate future will cause onerous difficulties for the operator and it is not against the public interest to let him have a temporary dispensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary is certainly stretching his mind to consider the matter of fares, bearing in mind that we are dealing with a temporary dispensation to the application of con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>640</span>
ditions to a particular road service licence already granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary made a point about two operators. Clearly, where two bus operators operate at present there will be some uniformity in fares. The Parliamentary Secretary gave the Committee an example where an application for an increase in fares, had been made by one operator, on the apparent understanding that the other operator on that route, would apply for a similar increase. Presumably, that temporary dispensation could not be forced on another operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if operator A applies for a fares increase which he feels his costs justify, while operator B, on the same route, says "I can grab more of the traffic by keeping my fares lower, so why should I increase them"? it is envisaged that operator A will say that that is an unduly onerous position. What would be the obligation of the commissioner vis-a-vis operator B, who may keep his fares lower and make positive gains, such as we see in current Channel ferry competition on fares? Would the commissioner not have to impose any conditions on an operator who was unwilling to increase his fares and had benefited compared with one who had already done so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: That question arises on clause 7. A dispensation would normally be granted only upon application. As the hon. Gentleman said, a dispensation cannot be forced on an operator who does not want a temporary dispensation from the conditions of his licence. One envisages a situation where two operators have the same conditions on fares imposed on the same route, one condition being that each charges 10p for travel from point A to point B. If one operator seeks a variation of that condition to raise his fare to 15p, he does so at the risk that the other operator may not follow suit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other operator may not have bothered to make that application because he believed that it would not be granted. But if the first operator's application to increase his fares to 15p is granted, the other operator may seek a temporary dispensation to allow him to move immediately into line before making his application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That could work the other way around. The applicant for a change in the fares condition could be someone who always wanted to charge less. At present, varia-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>641</span>
tions on fares conditions are more often sought in order to keep fares up rather than down, to protect one of the operators. But one could have a case where an operator approached the traffic commissioners to seek to have the fares conditions changed so that he could reduce his fare to 8p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other operator would not join in that application—indeed, he might well be an objector—but if the conditions were changed for the first operator and the fare was reduced, the other operator would probably feel that he was immediately forced to move into line. Legally, he would be faced with a condition requiring him to operate at a fare of 10p, but he could, of course, probably at the end of the hearing on the first operator's application for variation, immediately apply for a temporary dispensation, which would be granted to enable him to fall into line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an operator does not want to fall into line—as in the case referred to by the hon. Gentleman—and so does not seek any temporary dispensation, we shall have to deal with that when we come to clause 7(2) which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the traffic commissioners by whom a road service licence was granted may at any time while it is in force vary the licence by—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) altering in such manner as they think fit any condition as to fares attached under subsection (1) to the licence".</p></blockquote>
When we reach clause 7 we shall be considering the circumstances under which that power might be exercised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have discussed a limited number of the effects and ramifications of clause 4. I want to touch upon some matters that we have not considered, to try to set them within the overall framework of the Bill and make some comparisons between what is proposed in the Bill and our existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Up to now, particularly on Second Reading, the Minister has been suggesting that licensing is rather a nasty business that is somewhat outdated, being rooted in experiences of the 1930s that are no longer appropriate. Presumably, he will now put up a hearty defence for his clause and say that there should be a national system of quantity licensing as defined in
	<span class='label label-info column'>642</span>
the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that a slightly different, even an appreciably different, system of quantity licensing is defined in the Bill from that which exists in current law. Certainly, the Bill limits the scope of that part of our public transport system that is covered by quantity licensing. Nevertheless, once one has looked at the limits of the scope of quantity licensing, given that clause 4 stands part of the Bill, one sees that the controls, the scope, the role of quantity licensing are very similar to that which presently exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To control the number of services in an area is no different from present law. Admittedly, current law covers a different area for quantity licensing. In the way in which the services can operate, the routes along which they can run, and where they may stop along those routes, the Bill is to that extent the same as the present law. Therefore, I look forward to a hearty defence of the role of the licensing system, given that one accepts the differences of scope that the Bill proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall move on to look at all the conditions that may be attached, together with their variation, which depend upon this being passed. Then we shall come to some differences. There is a difference between clause 4 and the existing legislation that cannot be explained in these terms. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will assist the Committee by explaining the point that, as I understand matters, at present road service licences are attached to vehicles and can be applied for by operators of those vehicles. As I understand the Bill, that is no longer the case. One does not have to be an operator to apply for a road service licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The licence will not take effect until the successful applicant is an operator. I hope that I understand the Bill correctly, and that the Minister will advise me if I do not. It seems to me that there is nothing in the Bill that says that one must have an operator's licence before one applies for a road service licence. That is the difference, and presumably anyone may apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see that there may be reasons for that, but I should like the Minister to explain why he has chosen to act in this way. Clearly, it is not his intention that the licence should be used until the holder has qualified as an operator. One could, perhaps, understand the proposal if the Minister wanted a system under which people who were not operators
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0355">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>643</span>
could obtain road service licences. But that is not the Bill's intention, which seems to be that one may apply for a road service licence without being an operator, but having done that one has to obtain an operator's licence before the road service licence can be effective. Therefore I should like to know the reasoning behind the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to know, because I believe it is most relevant to clause stand part, whether the Minister's intention is—certainly it is my understanding of the Bill—to take away part of the flexibility of the 1968 Act in respect of road service licences. That Act enabled people to obtain permits to run certain types of bus without a road service licence—generally it applied to minibuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason why that should be removed by the Act. Admittedly, it would not be done by clause 4, but it has a direct bearing on the scope of road service licence provisions, which is why I raise the matter now. The 1968 Act enabled someone who wanted to run a bus of, I believe, up to 12 seats to obtain a permit to run it without a road service licence. That will now be removed. Therefore, I wish to ask whether what this part of the Bill—coupled with that which takes away the specific provision of the 1968 Act—will bring within road service licensing a category of service that is currently out with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, are there now people running minibus services on permits that enable them to operate without road service licences who, if the Bill is passed, will no longer be able to do that? Therefore, will the Bill in one sense extends the scope of road service licensing while narrowing it in many others such as excluding express services from road service licensing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to examine one of the effects of subsection (2) as that subsection has not been amended. Is the subsection designed to allow someone to run a service outside the area for which a road service licence is provided so long as the bus does not stop? That appears to be what it means, but what is its purpose? Is it to enable people to come within the definition of an express carriage operator? Is it to make sure that the route goes 30 miles from the point of
	<span class='label label-info column'>644</span>
picking up passengers to the point of depositing them? Does it allow that service to go into another area for which it has no road service licence and in which it is not permitted to stop except for emergencies? If that is the intention, the Bill contains a contradiction in its provisions concerning conditions attached to the licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems clear that the conditions that the traffic commissioner can attach to licences in his area go well beyond the questions raised about where a bus stops along its route. Yet here is a narrow sphere—at least, I hope that it is—where the Bill enables someone to drive a bus outside the area of the traffic commissioner who has granted the licence and, provided that he does not stop, he may continue on his merry way with no conditions attached. Is that really what the Bill intends? How can the subsection be read in any other way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish also to make a point about how the possessor of a road service licence will obtain his operator's licence. Furthermore, I want to ask whether, as my reading of the Bill indicates, if someone has received a road service licence from one group of traffic commissioners—or, indeed, from however many may be involved with the route in question—without being an operator at the time, he can apply to any other group of commissioners for another road service licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that there is nothing in the Bill that ties the requirements for an operator's licence to an application to those commissioners in the area in which the service will be run. I am merely seeking information at this stage because I do not understand the reasoning, unless it is that the Minister envisages that someone, having obtained a road service licence for one area and an operator's licence in another, can then come to a contractual arrangement with an operator to run the service in the area where the road service licence was issued. It appears to me that that would be perfectly legal as the Bill is drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, what is its justification and how will the Bill be enforced. Presumably conditions will be imposed on the operator who has the road service licence and it will be a matter between him and the person to whom he sub-contracts the service as to the conditions under which it will be run. Let us suppose that operator A has a road service licence from one set of traffic com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0356">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>645</span>
missioners and an operator's licence from another. He goes to operator B and says "I have a road service licence for a service in your area. How would you like to come to an arrangement with me to run that service?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill is drafted, that would be perfectly legal. They enter into that arrangement, operator B runs the service and is challenged about whether he has breached the conditions. What is his legal position? Can he fall back on the defence "I am operating within the terms of my contract with the man who has the road service licence"? That would appear to be a perfectly sound defence in court, and an action against him would fail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Am I right in thinking that the only way in which a successful action could be brought for breach of conditions attached to a road service licence would be to proceed against the operator who had that licence irrespective of whether the operator was licensed as such by somebody who had no interest in that road service licence. Those are some of the questions that are raised by this difficult and interesting clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The essence of the difference in principle between the two sides of the Committee is in the way we interpret the use of road service licences. As we proceed with the Bill, I am sure we shall find that none of the amendments will breach that fundamental principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that road service licences, as clause 4 recognises, are the major factor in retaining some form of control in the provision of a public transport system. This clause, taken with others that the Committee has dealt with, limits the application of road service licences both by the redefinition of vehicles and in respect of the areas in which public service vehicles will be used—namely, over 30 miles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the clause contains the basic principle of all legislation since 1930—that road service licences are required for providing a public transport system—the Bill now makes clear that there will be only a limited application of that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, it is still true that while it may be limited to the areas beyond 30 miles, the Government would recognise—and that may be why they are not extending into the stage carriage area the principle of no licensing—that the main purpose of clause 4 is to introduce the principle, no matter how limited and under
	<span class='label label-info column'>646</span>
whatever conditions, to the stage carriage area as newly defined in the Bill. It will still cover approximately 90 per cent. of the present bus services operated. It may be that clause 4 now makes clear that it is a very timid interpretation of freeing services—that is, allowing services to go free of any requirement of a road service licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, while the principle may be still applicable to 90 per cent. of services, it will be subject to different interpretation by those whose job it is to interpret this legislation and by the commissioners who grant the licences. In later clauses we shall come to the power of commissioners and the criteria they will use in the granting of road service licences. The principle is still very much embodied in this legislation, even though it will be undermined by the conditions that surround its application and the reduction in the powers of the commissioner in implementing a rather comprehensive approach to a transport problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major aspect of the interpretation of this licence will be in the public interest where the Bill goes on later to change the presumption in the granting of a service to the presumption of granting it unless it can be shown to be against the public interest that licences shall not be given to an operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major effect of the clause is fundamental. Its potential for change could be considerably greater than it appears at the moment, depending on how the commissioners are forced, to interpret the application for a licence and how lawyers interpret the commissioners reasons for granting it. That is a matter of major difference between the two sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's view and their attitude towards clause 4 appears to be that, by restricting the use and the granting of licences and their application by interpretation in certain areas, greater competition will result. Greater competition is felt to be in the public interest: if there is greater competition in a route area, it will produce a better transport system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's view is contrary to that. We believe that the provision of the licences so envisaged in clause 4, will serve to undermine the concept of network systems. We are very much wedded, as indeed are most transport operators, who are perhaps geared by past legislation and existing legislation, to the provision of a network system. The consequence of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>647</span>
providing network systems is that one must be prepared to consider that there is a cross-subsidisation principle—that some routes are more profitable than others and that in those circumstances we are prepared to provide a network system, even if that accepts that certain routes will begin to undermine other routes. This is determined by the provision of the licence system and at present is a factor taken into account by the commissioner in granting the licence. If we leave clause 4 in its present form, taking into account conditions in later clauses and those which we have already dealt with, it will undermine the provision of a network system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other difference between us the provision of licences. The Government seem to assume that a licence is something that has prevented competition as they would wish it. Our view is that the granting of a licence not necessarily grants a monopoly situation as such, but expects that the operator who is given the privilege of a licence will fulfil a number of obligations. That, basically, is our attitude to the operator. We say "While we may protect you in certain operations, and give licences because it is our judgment that too much competition will undermine the whole network system, we impose certain obligations upon you."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a new philosophy. The Labour Party has always held it. It was embodied in the 1930 legislation introduced by the Labour Government of the time. It is interesting to note that it is also the view of the major operators—certainly the major operators and the director-generals of the passenger transport authorities. So we oppose clause 4 because it will undermine the whole provision of transport on a network system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end by saying that while we do not accept that licensing can be justified on the ground that it would restrict competition or price cutting, the passenger transport authorities, in their brief to the members of this Committee, said that the main reason for justification for a licensing system was to ensure the provision at all times to the travelling public of an adequate public service over particular routes, rather than allowing a number of operators to compete on profitable routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a fundamental difference bet-
	<span class='label label-info column'>648</span>
ween us. When we debate later clauses, we shall consider whether in accepting clause 4 we are not undermining other obligations that we place on local authorities and passenger transport authorities, both in local authority legislation and transport legislation, to provide an adequate public service. By accepting clause 4, we shall begin to undermine not only the definition of public interest in a specified way in later clauses, but also the obligations that we impose on various authorities to provide a public integrated system without giving them the protection that would be afforded under licences. We therefore oppose the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While it is true that there are many fundamental differences between the two sides of the Committee, Labour Members throughout our proceedings have sought to be constructive in the amendments that they have tabled. There is not much difference between the two sides on the importance of road service licences, but when we come to the powers of enforcement, it appears that the Government are not prepared to back their judgment. When we suggested a realistic time, it was rejected. Surely, it is insufficient to say that the present law is such. We should at all times seek to improve the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one accepts the argument that these licences are fundamental, one would have thought that the logic of that argument was that the penalties for not so doing would be realistic. Yet in some areas it is cheaper to pay the fine than to obey the law. That was one of our arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We took a constructive approach to the role of the traffic commissioners in road service licensing. The Minister put a very coherent case, though it was not one with which I totally agreed. One of the points he made was that by an overall primacy of traffic commissioners, the rights of the individual area would be deprived. If that is his view in that instance, surely, when this clause talks about the granting of the road service licence—the traffic commissioner, in an area or part of an area through which a service will run but in which it does not set down or pick up, is being deprived of his right to consider the route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is that not equally as important as the Minister's point about the number of individual road service licences for each traffic commissioner's area? If he uses
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>649</span>
logic on that, surely he can use equal logic in his argument that if a bus goes through an area, whether or not it picks up, some consideration of the route is important. Should not the traffic commissioner and—more important—the people of the area, have some rights there, although the service is not setting down and picking up?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, that is not so, but I hope that the Minister will not merely say, "Well, that is the status quo". On a Bill of this nature, if our suggestions are better than the status quo—and we certainly think that they are—they should be accepted. It is insufficient for the Minister to say that the situation should remain as it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With dispensations, we again move into the realms of gobbledegook, and lawyers' paradises. When we discussed the bringing together of the granting of road licences this was opposed, although, in fairness, that was because the Minister did not think that our proposals would achieve our objective. Here we are considering the kind of service that could run through six different traffic commissioners' areas where there could be, in effect, six different dispensations by six different traffic commissioners. But what are the criteria for that? Those wonderful words "unduly onerous" could make lawyers very rich in determining what they mean and whether or not they would be in the interests of the public. Who is the arbiter there?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If "unduly onerous" means that the fares are too low, how do we equate that with
	<br><blockquote><p>"against the interests of the public"?</p></blockquote>
One could argue that although it might be unduly onerous because the service was losing money, by the second criterion it could be against the public interest to increase the fares. This is complete gobbledegook right through. It has been drawn by lawyers, for lawyers, to perpetuate lawyers, and I do not think that it does anything for the public. Having been as constructive as we have, and having tried to make practical common sense out of the clause where it does not exist, we must look carefully and search from the heart before supporting the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good and long debate on the clause. I do not disagree with many of the points raised by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) and the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>650</span>
I find it slightly surprising that the logic of their remarks has led them to the decision to vote against the clause. What the clause is doing is laying down the basic framework for the kind of road service licensing that we wish to retain for stage carriage services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have decided to continue controls on those local services because we accept that total abolition throughout the country would mean that we were proceeding at too fast a pace, in the view of many in the industry and in local authorities. We are not abolishing the traffic commissioner system; we are seeking to reform it. And as I have said, this is the first fundamental reform of its kind for 50 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the public and the industry will benefit from the kind of shake-up that we propose. I will make three brief points to support that belief. First, we are reforming the system to make it more streamlined, less bureaucratic and simpler for everyone to understand. Secondly, we are relaxing the straightjacket to allow greater competition, thereby encouraging existing operators to seek greater efficiency and value for money. But we also want—the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend were perfectly fair on this—new providers to come forward. We do not believe that the existing pattern of providers is necessarily the only pattern that one can have. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) is again perfectly correct in saying that we do see competition as being a way forward here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we are also creating the opportunity for a limited number of trial areas to be set up where licensing will be removed. That is also true and we will come to it at a later stage. These areas will only come into existence on the application of the locally-elected county councils which are prepared to examine whether increased competition might provide a better spur to improving services and efficiency than an ever-increasing reliance on support from the rate payers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certainly true that we have considered the arguments for changing the whole structure of the traffic commissioners and passing their power to, for example, the county councils. We decided after long thought that that would not be an overall advantage, and that much would be lost by such action. The similarity and links between the public service vehicle system and that for goods vehicles carries with it obvious savings in manpower and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0359">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>651</span>
expense. To create a separate system in the counties would require additional resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most important—I think my hon. Friends would agree—is that the independence of the commissioners is something which allows them to decide between the conflicting disputes across county boundaries, and also preserves the interests of the districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness raised a number of detailed points. It is certainly true that one does not need an operator's licence before applying for a road service licence. We believe that that is a sensible provision, although it might not be sensible—in some circumstances such as in rural areas—for the person to buy the vehicle before he has been granted a licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>652</span>

	<p>very fair point for the right hon. Gentleman to raise, and what we have in mind there is to try to simplify the system as far as the traffic commissioners are concerned. Our basic aim is that the commissioners should be responsible for licensing local services in their own area. We hope that we have simplified the procedures by which the commissioners can grant a licence for other areas where services do not pick up and put down passengers. Those are the "corridor" proposals to which I referred. I believe that what we have set out here is a sensible structure.</p>

	<p>Lastly, I remind the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) that he should take on board that this Government have doubled the penalties and I have stated my reasons for not going further than that.
