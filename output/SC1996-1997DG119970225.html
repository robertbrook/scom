	<div class='legislation'>Draft Advice and Assistance (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1997</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Advice and Assistance (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1997.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Civil Legal Aid (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1997.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regulations provide for the uprating of financial eligibility limits for advice and assistance and for civil legal aid. The changes proposed do not make any major adjustment to the scope of eligibility. It may, however, be useful if I briefly describe each of the regulations in a little more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Advice and Assistance (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1997 provide for financial eligibility increases in relation to advice and assistance. In advice and assistance cases, the calculation is carried out on the basis of weekly income. The regulations raise the lower limit from £;67 to £;69, and the upper limit from £;162 to £;166. The regulations also revise the scale of contributions for applicants with disposable income between the upper and lower income limits for advice and assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Civil Legal Aid (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1997 revise the financial eligibility limits for civil legal aid applications. They raise the lower disposable income limits for civil legal aid—below which civil legal aid is available without contribution by the assisted person—from £;2,498 to £;2,563 a year. They increase the upper limit—above which civil legal aid is not available—from £;8,158 to £;8,370 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed changes represent a 2.6 per cent. uprating on the 1996-97 eligibility limits. This matches increases proposed in the level of income-related social security benefits. That will ensure that people on low and modest incomes will—providing they satisfy the other tests which apply—continue to have access to the legal system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.33 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Liddell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In general, I welcome the regulations, but there are one or two areas of concern that it would be as well to address at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The eligibility upratings allow greater access to justice for people who cannot afford to fund their own court actions. However, I am concerned about the constraints on eligibility that have arisen since the eligibility changes in 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Legal Aid annual report for 1995–96 indicates that an increasing number of people who have been offered legal aid refuse to take in up to pursue their court action. Between 1994–95 and 1995–96, the number of people who had been offered legal aid but refused to take it increased by 18 per cent. Does the Minister know why that has happened, and whether the trend is likely to increase in the future?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The level of contribution required to pursue an action is prohibitive to some people, especially those on a very low income. In the sheriff courts, 5 per cent. of those receiving legal aid were required to make a contribution of between £;500 and £;1,000, and 3 per cent. were required to make a contribution of more than £;1,000. Given that the income levels outlined by the Minister of State, Scottish Office are already very low, this seems to be a punitive prohibition on people who wish to pursue actions in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a particular concern about single women on low income. Scottish Women's Aid groups have estimated that almost half the women they support who require some form of legal help do not proceed with an action because of the cost. As a result, it is not unlikely or improbable that some of those women will return to, or remain in, a situation in which they are being abused because they cannot meet the cost of pursuing legal action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is particularly worrying that those women—indeed, anyone who is confronted with such difficulties—are denied access to the law when they need it so much. The regulations have been laid precisely to help such people, but it would be remiss of me not to say that we must not allow the law to be seen as designed to protect the interests of the comfortably off and providing no tangible benefits or rights to those on limited incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would welcome an elucidation on those matters from the Minister. There may be a need for further consideration of why there has been a reduction in the number of people taking up legal aid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.36 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also seek clarification from the Minister on the question of income. He will be aware that in several recent cases—it has been prevalent in England and Wales, but has not necessarily occurred to the same extent in Scotland—concern has been expressed about people with substantial assets receiving legal aid in civil or criminal cases as a result of concealment of income. In his view, are income levels adequately checked? Does he believe that there is no misuse of the system as a result of concealment of income where, for example, assets are held by a spouse in a trust or because of some sort of income evasion measure which has been deliberately designed to allow people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
to qualify for that which they would not otherwise qualify?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.37 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) asked some relevant questions. I shall deal with them and then answer the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been as generous as they can, taking into account the enormous burden that legal aid already places on the taxpayer. Those on income support and equivalent income will contillue to receive civil legal aid on advice and assistance, free of any contribution. Those on modest incomes—above income support level—will be required to make some contribution, but it will be directly related to their disposable income. Disposable income is assessed by subtracting various deductions for dependants, allowances, housing costs, council tax and so on from gross income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Expenditure on legal aid in Scotland has been increasing sharply and is still rising. It reached more than £;125 million in 1995–96 and is expected to reach about £;133 million in the current financial year. In setting eligibility limits, the Government must make a judgment as to the appropriate level, having regard, on the one hand, to providing access to legal services for those who are unable to afford them and, on the other, to the need to control expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must bear in mind that the most needy should receive the help that they require. As I have said, the contribution which people will be required to pay will depend on disposable income. We have received representations concerning contributions and will consider them when deciding what improvements might be brought forward to the civil legal aid system in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, East mentioned the issue of domestic violence, to which we attach considerable importance. We abhor domestic violence and want it to be eradicated from society. We acknowledge the problems associated with domestic violence and appreciate the need to protect women and children from the consequences of it and deal with the abusers properly through the criminal justice and penal systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received representations from Scottish Women's Aid. Last year, Scottish Office officials had a constructive meeting with its representatives. We will bear in mind their views when, in due course, we consult about civil legal aid and related matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan asked about fraud and misuse of legal aid, and the inappropriateness of
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
giving legal aid to those whose wealth is well above the required level. Although we do not believe that there is widespread fraud, we are concerned to make certain that the potential for fraud is reduced and those who abuse the system are identified. The Legal Aid Board takes the issue seriously and where appropriate will refer a case to the proper authorities for further investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now seeking to strengthen the board's existing investigative powers through the criminal legal assistance provisions of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill. The purpose is to ensure that the board can fully investigate matters relating to the provisions of criminal legal assistance, thereby reducing the potential for abuse of the system. We will give careful consideration to the extent to which the board's investigative powers in relation to civil legal aid should be strengthened. Of course, if there is a case of fraud, the matter should be referred to the procurator fiscal for further consideration as appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Lady wants me to check on any particular matters relating to income levels, I certainly can do so and give her the information in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan asked about income levels in relation to those with substantial assets concealing wealth. I have to say to him that those are matters that the Scottish Legal Aid Board should investigate and should have a clear idea about before legal aid is granted. If there is abuse, that is not the purpose of legal aid and we want to see it rooted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by saying that in cash terms legal aid provision in 1987–88 was £;44.6 million. By this year it will be £;132.6 million. That gives an indication of how the legal aid budget has gone up by leaps and bounds. We want to make certain that it goes to those for whom it was intended and that it is properly administered. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
