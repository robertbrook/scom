	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before our proceedings finished this morning, I was warming up towards discussing the democratic accountability found in the present system of local government, LEAs and their education committees and sub-committeees. I said how democratic accountability was honourable—indeed, essential—and that it stretched back through this century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of state education arose because of the total failure of the private sector to provide a good quality education, other than an expensive one for the elite. Therefore, the Church of England and non-conformist Churches provided basic education for the population at large. In the 19th century, Governments took on board that responsibilities—quite literally—with the establishment of board schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board schools of 120-odd years ago had a better system of democratic accountability than the grant-maintained schools of today. With the board schools, it was not only the parents of children who had the right to elect the members of the school board; it was all eligible ratepayers, whether or not they had children in a particular school. That is as it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this new, constrained system of democracy, there is a host of taxpayers—payers of income tax, VAT, Excise duty, the new business rate tax and the poll tax, soon to be the council tax—who contribute to the funds that are spent in grant-maintained schools, but have no say as to who will be responsible for running them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill proposes to get rid of LEA committees, which, throughout the 20th century, have been responsible for ensuring accountability at the local level in the provision of education in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 245 would omit section 6(2) and part II of schedule 1 to the Education Act 1944. Section 6(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The local administration of the statutory system of public education shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Parts II … of the said schedule."</p></blockquote>
The said schedule refers to the first schedule, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every local education authority shall, in accordance with arrangements approved by the Minister, establish such education committees as they think it expedient to establish for the efficient discharge of their functions with respect to education."</p></blockquote>
Such a requirement will be removed from primary legislation. Does the removal of that part of the Education Act 1944 mean that an LEA will no longer have education
	<span class='label label-info column'>1382</span>
committees, because the power to set up the committees has been taken away from it? Alternatively, will an LEA still be able to have education committees? If so, what legislation will cover their governance? Part II of schedule 1 of the 1944 Act sets out several provisions on how the committees should operate. They will be taken out of the schedule by clause 245.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the provisions that will be removed from schedule 1 are instructive. In view of the Government's long-awaited, much postponed, yet-to-be-published proposals on the reform of local government in Wales, one provision is of specific interest to Wales. The Secretary of State said that he intends to publish proposals on the creation of unitary authorities in Wales, the number of which will be in the lower 20s. That means almost trippling the number of education authorities in Wales. It has already been agreed generally that there is no way in which 20-plus education authorities can each provide all the services that are currently provided by the eight authorities. The expertise does not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3 of part II of schedule 1 comes to the aid of the Secretary of State. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where it appears to the Minister to be expedient that two or more local education authorities should combine for the purpose of exercising some but not all of their functions with respect to education and that those authorities should establish a joint committee for that purpose, the Minister may after consultation with the authorities by order establish a joint education committee of those authorities and provide for the reference to the committee of such questions relating to those functions as in the opinion of the Minister should be so referred".</p></blockquote>
Again, that requirement is being removed from primary legislation. I have examined the schedule in the Bill to see if such powers are conferred in another way. They are not. I can only assume that the Government are removing the provisions from the 1944 Act for the express purpose of getting rid of local education authorities. I accept that such a measure does not exist at present, but some requirement could be introduced that would cover Wales if the local government reforms were implemented, although I am still sceptical about them. The Minister cannot go into too much detail now as we are awaiting the publication of the proposals by the Welsh Office, but contained in them could be a suggestion that what we are about to remove from the 1944 Act will be put back into the legislation for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is removed is the statutory requirement to establish an education committee. Furthermore, it is possible to have different commencement orders for Wales under this part of the Bill. We are agreed that discussion on the future of education in Wales and the organisation of the Welsh Joint Education Committee is best left until the local government reorganisation after the publication of the White Paper and the introduction of legislation. That is possible in view of what I said about the different commencement orders. Education authorities can still establish committees under the Local Government Act 1972.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister of State for that reply. I shall take up that theme because he seems to be saying that although the clause could be left to the Secretary of State to enact at a later stage when he considers it appropriate, even if he were to do so, a local authority could set up an education committee under the 1972 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0871">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1383</span>
I shall consider some of the provisions in part II of schedule 1 of the 1944 Act. Does the 1972 Act lay down similar provisions on the way in which education committees work or will the Minister have to establish such provisions by order, regulations, code of conduct or guidelines if education committees are to exist even though the statutory provision is removed? Perhaps we are going through a wholly unnecessary process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the Government proposing to publish part II of schedule 1 of the 1944 Act as guidelines for education authorities that set up education committees, or do they intend to introduce a completely new set of guidelines? It would be interesting to know what guidelines will be issued for non-statutory education committees. Perhaps education authorities will be able to set up these committees in whatever way they like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 5 of part II of schedule 1 of the 1944 Act it wisely states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every education committee of a local education authority shall include persons of experience in education and persons acquainted with the educational conditions prevailing in the area for which the committees acts."</p></blockquote>
That seems to be a wise provision. In this new world of non-statutory education committees, will members of such a committee be required to have anything to do with the world of education in their area, to know about education or to have experience of it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider other aspects. Paragraph 6 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At least a majority of every education committee of a local education authority shall be members of the authority".</p></blockquote>
That means elected members. Does clause 245 mean that the non-statutory education committees that will be allowed to exist will not have to contain a majority of locally-elected members? For example, could the council decide to appoint half a dozen local business men to the education committee and let them get on with the job? It would be interesting to know what the Government have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 7 of part II of schedule 1 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every local education authority shall consider a report from an education committee of the authority before exercising any of their functions with respect to education"</p></blockquote>
although it adds
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that an authority may dispense with such a report if, in their opinion, the matter is urgent".</p></blockquote>
In general, a statutory education committee should proceed only on the basis of reports made to it for its consideration. In the case of non-statutory committees, will that requirement be removed? Will they be able to meet and, as a matter of course, listen to what the chief education officer has to say—if there is one—and proceed on the basis of verbal reports?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'> Mr. Paul Murphy 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether my hon. Friend intends to deal with this matter, but it is important in England and in Wales. I refer to the Catholic diocesan education authorities, other Church authorities and their representation on education committees. Will the rights that they currently have by virtue of their membership continue under the new dispensation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, my hon. Friend raises an important point. The existing legislation contains provision for that, but once the Bill is enacted and section 6(2) and part II of the first schedule to the 1944 Act are
	<span class='label label-info column'>1384</span>
removed, the Government must table secondary legislation or guidelines to take account of the practice for which our legal system currently provides. It will be interesting to know the Government's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 9 of part II of schedule 1 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The minutes of proceedings of an education committee of the local education authority shall be open to the inspection of any local government elector for the area on payment of a fee not exceeding [5p] and any such local government elector may make a copy thereof or an extract therefrom".</p></blockquote>
We also know that local electors can attend meetings of local education committees. If part II of the schedule is expunged from our legislation by clause 245, will that remove the right of an elector to examine the proceedings of the existing statutory education committees and to take copies of those proceedings if he or she wants to study them? Will non-statutory education committees not have that obligation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I am turning into a cock-eyed optimist, but I should have thought that, when removing the obligations from primary legislation, the Government would have explained their intentions for the non-statutory voluntary committees that local education committees may establish if they so wish under the new regime. Those questions must be answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government first thought of the clause, perhaps they had no intention of allowing non-statutory committees to exist, but given the nods and winks passing between those on the Government Front Bench and the civil servants sitting in the Room but outside the Committee, I now know that such committees will continue. Paragraph 6.5 of the White Paper deserves to be quoted to remind the Committee of the Government's thinking when they introduced clause 245:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Other wider changes are also likely to affect LEAs. The current review of the structure of local government will have a bearing on the way LEAs exercise their functions. In general, as the number of GM schools increases, local authorities will need to consider carefully the most effective way of delivering their continuing responsibilities for education in the light of their particular circumstances. At present there are statutory obstacles which deny local authorities the organisational flexibility which they need to respond properly to the evolution of their education functions. The Government proposes to remove such obstacles, in particular the requirement to establish an Education Committee. Some local authorities may soon be in sight of no longer needing them."</p></blockquote>
When I first read that paragraph, it took my breath away. I might have misinterpreted it, but I shall quote again the sentence that I considered incredible:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At present there are statutory obstacles which deny local authorities the organisational flexibility which they need to respond properly to the evolution of their education functions."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis (Cerdigion and Pembroke, North)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that that is tantamount to saying that democracy is an obstacle and that the smooth flow of business requires its removal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That interpretation could certainly apply to the paragraph that I quoted. I shall read out to the Committee the next sentence as that strengthens the hon. Gentleman's argument:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government proposes to remove such obstacles, in particular the requirement to establish an Education Committee."</p></blockquote>
I have never though that the existence of an education committee was an obstacle to the provision of an education service. I should be most interested to know what the statutory obstacles are that deny local authorities
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0872">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1385</span>
the organisational flexibility with which to respond properly to the evolution of the educational functions. I want that spelt out. What do the Government have in mind? Can they identify local education authority committee practices that prevent an education service from being delivered? Why will some local authorities soon not need a democratically accountable education authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the functions that will remain with the LEAs, even in the one, two or half-dozen authorities in which the funding agency will take responsibility—either in parallel with the local education committee or, in some circumstances, entirely—for the provision of school places. The LEA will still be left with the responsibility for special educational needs. That is 20 per cent. of the school population at any time, with about 2 per cent.—or 5 per cent. in some authorities—having particular difficulties that require a statement. Are not those people worthy of democratic representation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to special educational needs, which is one of the main continuing responsibilities of local authorities. Statementing is conducted partly by the council and partly by the health authority. Under the new community care legislation, social services committees are given the lead role. As that committee—or whichever council committee it may be—will take on the oversight of the council's work, the democratic involvement that he and the hon. Member for Ceredigon and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis) want will remain. I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's anxiety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is now emerging from the Conservative Back Benches that it is the Government's policy for education provision to be transferred to the social services committee. I was not aware of that, but that is what the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) was saying when he spoke of the lead role of the social services committee and the health authority. Let me remind him that under the Bill the education authority has the lead role in statementing, and in that process the services of the health authority and of the social services section of the local authority are called upon. The hon. Gentleman seems to imply that we can forget the education role, minimise it and transfer it to social services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not speaking for the Government. I was merely suggesting that there would be a committee of the council and that that might be the committee with the responsibility. The hon. Gentleman's argument seems to be that there would be no democratic accountability for that work of the council. As he knows, some parts of local authority work are statutory, so chief education officers and directors of social services have, by law, to be appointed and are accountable to committees. I presume that there will be a change to that, but not to non-accountability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I still insist that the hon. Gentleman is saying that the democratic deficit that the clause will cause by eroding local authorities' educational responsibilities will be taken over by their social services committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of part III of the Act would make the education department of the local authority the prime mover. It would call on the social services department or the health authority or trust. Neither have any direct local
	<span class='label label-info column'>1386</span>
democratic accountability. The Bill will remove direct democratic accountability. Children with special educational needs and their parents will suffer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about a democratic deficit. A distinction should be made between those bodies that are legally responsible for a service—for example, the LEA for special educational needs—and the method of reporting by those bodies via the council that local people deem appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the new functions that emerge from the reorganisation of community care and of education through grant-maintained schools, some Labour authorities believe that it may be best to set up children's committees to which the education committees and social services committees can report. Those Labour-controlled authorities do not recognise a democratic deficit, so why does the hon. Gentleman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to a trend that has occurred in one or two places, but I had not realised that the Government were counting on those developments to take over the role of education committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, I have mentioned only children with special educational needs, for whom LEAs will continue to be responsible. Nursery provision will also remain with the LEA. It is important that LEAs should continue to be responsible for the specifically educational provision of nurseries. Transport, school meals and discretionary grants must also be catered for. Cuts in local government spending make discretionary grants few and far between. Does the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) suggest that discretionary grants should come within the purview of the children's committee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A substantial role remains for a local authority in the provision of education, especially for the majority of authorities whose school places will not be controlled by the funding agency for a long time—perhaps the rest of my lifetime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to nurseries. Education committees already share responsibilities for nursery provision with social services committees. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman meant nursery schools and classes. He claims that the education officer class will continue to exist within local authorities. We are discussing committees. When I served on a council, we held endless discussion about which committee was responsible for the youth service—the education committee, or leisure and amenities, and so on. After the Taylor report, I argued that it should be the responsibility of the education committee. In my council, it came under a different committee, but the service was still there. In my view, it was part educational but a different committee looked after that aspect of the council's work. We must not forget that the entire council is responsible for the work of all its officers and branches of activity, so accountability remains.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. To an extent, he reinforces my point that a number of important functions which can be regarded as primarily educational will still lie with the local authority, so the removal of the statutory provision is unnecessary. The Government must explain what the statutory obstacles are which prevent education authorities from doing their job, even with the extension of the GM system.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0873">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1387</span>
They must also explain why an LEA will not need a specific committee when it has substantial matters to deal with, including adult and continuing education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many matters relating to non-statutory provision in education are the subject of so much controversy that it would be wrong to remove the statutory obligation in respect of an education committee and leave it to the council to appoint a non-statutory committee which does not have a set of rules to govern its operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many controversies are raging throughout the country over educational provision, for which education committees can at present be held accountable by the electorate. Under the proposed system, although the local authority has an accountable role, the confidence of the electorate that it is making proper provision under specific guidelines to consider carefully all education matters will be eroded. We are being left with a system with far less accountability. The alternative system that is being promoted and used as an excuse to explain that there is no longer a need for an education committee arises out of the development of GM schools. The funding agency for schools is not elected; it is appointed by the Secretary of State. It operates under rules issued by him, doles out money provided by him and has no democratic accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect, faceless bureaucrats in a funding agency will make decisions—in secret, as far as I understand—which were formerly made publicly in an education committee. Conservative Members will recall that I pointed out that local electors have the right to obtain copies of the minutes of an education committee and to attend its meetings. Those meetings are public except on occasions when it is dealing with a specific matter relating to personnel or something that requires a preliminary secret discussion, when the public are excluded. That happens very rarely. I have carefully looked through the schedule that covers the funding agency, but I cannot find any right for a local elector to attend the meetings of the funding agency to observe its discussions on the doling out of money to schools. Nor can I find any right for a local elector to have a copy of the minutes of such meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no requirement in the schedule for the sort of minutes that a local authority education committee would keep to be kept by the funding agency when it deals with the distribution of money to grant-maintained schools or with any other function that the Secretary of State may give it. He has the power to give it duties here, there and everywhere. All the democratic accountability and openness is being removed. Frankly, clause 245 moves in the opposite direction to the Government's declarations about open government and the provision of information. It shows such declarations to be a hollow sham. The openness of local government is removed by the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I felt that I had to respond to the interventions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fundamental issue is that the clause removes the statutory responsibility of a council with educational functions to have an education committee with all that follows from part II of schedule 1 of the 1944 Act. In one respect, nothing that the Minister might say in response to the debate will satisfy me as long as democratic accountability for the education service remains non-statutory. He may be able to give me some assurances on the grounds that, having swept away the framework, the Government would ensure that local government members with knowledge and experience of education in their area would form the majority on an education committee, that the committee would meet in public and that it deliberations would be available to local electors—although it is a pity that no alternative provision was set out before we discussed this clause. It is clear that, as long as the function remains non-statutory, some authorities will be tempted not to take that option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman protests too much. The composition of a funding authority has nothing to do with this clause. The local council committees will continue to do their work. They will publish minutes and the public will be able to attend their meetings. An accountable committee will remain for any function for which the local council is responsible. That committee will be open to the public and will publish its minutes. The clause simply removes the requirement for a statutory education committee. There is nothing to stop a council having an education committee if it wants one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman still does not satisfy me on that point. The White Paper gives the game away when it refers to education committees as "statutory
	<span class='label label-info column'>1390</span>
obstacles" to the provision of an education service. My fears might have been allayed had the Government published before this debate details of the way in which they envisaged non-statutory provision would work. Alternatively, they might have made it clear that they were modelling future provision on councils A, B and C, which were moving towards functioning without education committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's approach to the provision of education services will have a big gap if they remove the requirement to have an education committee overseeing the provision of education in a local authority area. Even in areas where the funding agency will have a primary role, important aspects of education will continue to deserve a committee that deals with them in their entirety. Joint sub-committees may cover areas where there are obvious overlaps, but education committees—and the accountability that they bring—must not be destroyed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Bridgend, I should like to link the discussion of the clause to the prospects in Wales over the next couple of years. It has been noted that local government in Wales is to be reorganised. The new unitary authorities will have to make crucial decisions. For example, if the clause is accepted they will have to decide whether they should establish education committees. I have no doubt that the Welsh district councils would want to do that and that the unitary authorities, when they are established, will want to do that as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unitary authorities will have to decide whether they want education departments and whether those departments should provide the same range of services as are provided at present. Local government reorganisation will represent a crunch time in Wales. The decision by authorities to set up education committees and departments covering the provision of services to their own schools and, for a time, to grant-maintained schools, will depend on their perceptions of the way in which circumstances will develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the unitary authorities believe that the grant-maintained movement will grow, clearly they will hestitate to establish the education departments and education committees. I hope that they—see the need to establish such departments and committees. However, the knowledge that they will not be able to sell their services to grant-maintained schools will be a further disincentive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there will be a great danger that those services will not be provided. Conservative Members have displayed a touching faith in the market and a belief that those services will emerge. However, I challenge anybody to be entirely confident about that. Certainly, the quality of the services that may be established in that way is a cause for doubt. It is difficult to be confident that they will bear any resemblance to the sophisticated services that local authority euducation departments currently provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the hon. Gentleman would concentrate on the possibility that unitary authorities might collaborate in one way or another in the provision of the services for which they will be responsible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was precisely what I was about to consider. That collaboration would be very much on the agenda in Wales if there was confidence that local authorities would provide services. The possibility of collaboration in various ways between authorities is currently under discussion. I should have liked to see at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0875">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1391</span>
least a version of the amendment that I tabled this morning adopted as that would enable LEAs to sell services to non-contiguous LEAs in other parts of Wales. That would create an open market for them to sell services to each other and to collaborate, while at the same time it would allow the private sector to make a contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea of lead authorities has been mooted. Some of the unitary authorities in Wales would be lead authorities and would develop extensive education departments to provide all types of services, such as teams of inspectors, that would be available to other education authorities in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying wide of the terms of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate you guidance, Mr. Martin. My worry is that doubt about the requirement to establish an education committee will lead to doubt aobut the need to establish an extensive education department and its associated services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate that if an education committee were not to be established in a lead authority in Wales—for example, in Cardiff, which might change hands politically—and consequently it had no services to sell to smaller authorities, tremendous difficulties could ensue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that there could be an impoverishment of the provision of services in Wales, where we have a tradition of the collective provision of such services. We are not quite as enamoured of market mechanisms as are Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the process of reorganisation, there is a danger that the entire system will become destabilised. That could cause damage to pupils, schools and the education authorities. Destabilisation must be avoided. The Secretary of State for Wales told me on one occasion that he was convinced that all unitary authorities in Wales would have education departments and directors of education. I was pleased to hear that. They should also have education committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Office in Wales has a distinct approach to various matters which differs from the approach in England. There is a special Welsh quality about the Welsh Office. It has accepted the importance of the principle of intervention in market mechanisms. I shall ask the Welsh Office to issue guidelines to the new unitary authorities in Wales to encourage them to establish education committees and the comprehensive provision of services in education departments. The Welsh Office should show that it is in favour of that, because that is what the people of Wales want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This may be one of my last contributions to the Committee stage of the Bill—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] If Conservative Members can contain their disappointment, I shall try to speak during the latter stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 245 may be the single most important clause in the Bill; it is also the shortest, and its length is in direct proportion to its importance—[HON. MEMBERS: "Indirect."]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Inverse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1392</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indirect will do nicely. I am a mathematician. I have examined the Bill as a parent, as a former teacher who worked in education for 25 years and as a representative of the people. I looked for the justification for the clause. My sole ambition in serving on the Committee was to try to ensure that the Bill would genuinely improve children's education. We have spoken precious little about that, we have heard little from the Government about that and the Bill barely addresses itself to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is really about constitutional change in local government, which will be brought about by taking away the need for a local authority to have an education committee. Unfortunately, neither the White Paper nor the Bill acknowledges or discusses that issue. The Bill shifts responsibility away from local government—from the rim to the hub. Local authorities between them spend more than £13.5 billion of taxpayers' money each year on education. More than 8 million children are being educated in 24,000 schools. The clause is probably one of the most important issues in education during the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The future local accountability of schools has been consigned to two lines—less than 20 words—in the clause, tucked into the tail end of the Bill. Have we discussed these important, constitutional issues? I have not heard one single word about them from Conservative Members. Has the Minister or Conservative Members given any justification for the clause, which will take away the power of LEAs? When he sums up, I hope that the Minister will enlighten us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities play an important part in the public life of Britain. For more then 100 years, agencies have provided our public services. They are a vehicle for developing, articulating and—most importantly—representing community interests. That has been a feature of our democracy over the past 100 years. LEAs have ensured that there is a defusion of political power from the centre outwards. We have developed a pluralist society without an over-concentration of power at any one level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1944 Act placed a duty on local authorities—if they were responsible for education—to have an education committee. That gave local people the power and competence to make local decisions. Local people could influence the way in which their schools developed, in the interests of people in their areas. By law, the education committees have to contain a broad representation not only of councillors, but of other people in the local community. Universities, parents and trade unions are represented to produce a wide forum of local interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cannot the hon. Gentleman accept that, in future, local people will still have a say over what happens to schools in their area, either through the governing bodies of grant-maintained schools—which include parents, teachers and people from local communities—or through the elected members of the local authority? The hon. Gentleman talks about local authorities, but he should be talking about a committee of the authority. Under the Bill, the council will still retain responsibility and will be continually accountable for the work in education for which it has statutory responsibility. The only question that should be raised is what sort of committee structure it should have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be interested to know where in the Bill there is a provision for community interests to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0876">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1393</span>
represented on the governing bodies of GM schools. I should also like to know where the responsibilities for running education will be placed if the education committee is removed. Will it be with the housing committee, with the public cleansing committee or with finance? An education committee in a local authority guarantees that all the expertise and knowledge is focused in that area. That is its strength and that is why Opposition Members believe that local education committees should remain enshrined in law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have worked in partnership with central Government, who underline their constitutional relationship. They have been partners in the control of our education system. In fact, the 1944 Act allowed local education authorities to provide an appropriate education service tailored to local needs, but within a framework of national policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we pass the clause, LEA's will no longer need to have an education committee. I am not arguing that such provisions should be cast in stone and that they should remain unchanged for years. Since the 1944 Act LEAs have changed and developed; they have not stood still. Community education is a good example of how education committees have responded to local needs. In Cambridge, Leicestershire and Devon, community education is widespread. I put it to the hon. Member for Wyre Forest that if that is controlled by a children's committee, what will happen with the wider issues of education? What about community education and the continuing needs of the community from the cradle to the grave? In many authorities, education is not just viewed within the narrow confines of the compulsory years of education overseen by a children's committee. The needs of the whole community must be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a letter recently from the chairman of governors at the Devoran county primary school in Truro, the Rev. Michael Palmer, who argued that the partnership between the school and the local authority should continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Recently, we have had much more responsibility given to us under the Local Management of Schools arrangement and this we accept so long as we can continue to have advice and help from our Education Department. Although we realise that the new proposals do not entail the abolition of local authorities, their responsibilities will be greatly diminished, and we regret this greatly as we benefit from our partnership with them, and it certainly lightens the not inconsiderable task of acting as Governors to-day."</p></blockquote>
Governors such as the Rev. Michael Palmer—who has given many years of service to his community both through the Church and in education—look to the education authority and the education committee for guidance and assistance in running their schools. Instead of the local education committees there will be the funding agency for schools, which will be in Darlington. I hope that the Minister will tell us whether parents and local community interests will be represented on the funding agency. What influences will local people have? Will they be able to find out what the agency is discussing and when? We need answers to those questions today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides that between the 10 per cent. and 75 per cent. limits of opting out there will be two bodies to manage and control education in an area. Those two bodies will not be sharing responsibility, but competing with each other. That is what the Secretary of State told us on Second Reading. They will run parallel—side by side
	<span class='label label-info column'>1394</span>
—but never meet. That will lead to chaos and confusion from one end of the country to another. That has been one of the themes running through our debates. Some hon. Member represent far-flung areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will come back to Plymouth in a moment. Cornwall is just over the river from Plymouth. The Gaelic for confusion is "brochan". There will be brochan in Cornwall, but, fortunately, the Scots will be spared that. My hon. Friends the Members for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North, for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) and for Bridgend and the right hon. Member for Conwy (Sir W Roberts), the Minister of State, Welsh Office, will note that the Welsh for Chaos and confusion is "cawdyl a smonach".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend pointed out that through the ballot box electors could vote for their local council, which would then appoint an education committee. He pre-empted what I was going to say, but I shall say it none-the-less. Paragraph 9 of schedule 1 to the Education Act 1944 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The minutes of proceedings of an education committee of the local education authority shall be open to the inspection of any local government elector for the area on payment of a fee not exceeding one shilling."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, for one shilling electors could buy their bit of democracy from their local council. For one shilling Westminster council would provide the account of the education committee—for two bob it would provide a cemetery as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause sweeps away an education system that has been tried and tested for years. The local authorities were given no special place in the consultation process, but were in the same position as every other body. Will the Minister tell us whether particular consultation with LEAs took place before the proposal was introduced? I suggest that it did not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members maintain that the argument that there will be no great shift from the rim to hub is inappropriate, but that power will be transferred to parents and governors. It is unfortunate that the hon. Member for Battersea is not in the Committee at present. Those represented in one school will have only the narrow interests of that school at heart. That is the job of the governing bodies. It is not for them to consider the wider issues of democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a democracy people are ultimately responsible for the public service because it is funded from the public purse and taxpayers' money. Accountability can be exercised properly only through an elected local level of government. Parents should have real choice by selecting, electing and, if necessary, rejecting those who run their education service. I am sad that the funding agency will be appointed only by the Secretary of State for Education because that will destroy such accountability and democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to withdraw that remark, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we listen to speeches by Opposition Members, it is occasionally difficult to appreciate fully their objections to the clause. I could understand and should support their objections if the purpose of the clause was to abolish education committees throughout the land. I would not support such a proposal. Indeed, despite the fact that I might incur the wrath of my hon. Friend the Minister, in some ways I hope that many authorities will not take advantage of this permissive clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I believe that the clause is in the Bill for a simple reason. In the past, some local councils—in wishing to exercise their quite properly devolved democratic responsibilities—have wanted a different organisational structure at committee level in their authorities. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea spoke of the possibility of a committee involving children's services. I am agnostic about a particular method of organising local authority services. However, it is odd for one specific service to be separated from the others in so far as there is a statutory obligation to have an education committee. I do not understand the need for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most councils would wish to retain an education committee, but if they do not, so what? There is nothing wrong with that. Throughout our proceedings, Opposition Members have laid great stress on the need to devolve powers away from the centre. This provision is a devolution of power away from the centre in that it allows a local authority, if it so wishes, democratically to decide that it does not need an education committee and wants a different method of organising its council committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should there be a statutory obligation to have a particular committee? That is ludicrous. Surely many local authorities would welcome the clause as it would give them the option—no more, no less.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recall that, under part II of schedule 1 to the Education Act 1944, one obligation on an education committee is to have a majority of elected members who have a knowledge of education, especially in their own area. Could the hon. Gentleman say whether, under a system without an education committee, there would be a duty to have members on the new committee with a knowledge of education, especially in their own area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 1944 Act, which I read avidly each night before I sleep to ensure that I am up to date on it, contained other provisions. One was that there must be teachers on the education committee. That provision has been changed by recent legislation, which gives different powers in relation to who is on a particular education committee. That is not a problem. Any council, when organising its committees and appointing people to them, will note the experience, skills and background of its different members. The hon. Gentleman knows that many people who serve on their local council and give admirable service to their local community in that way also serve on school governing bodies. Indeed, many local authorities encourage their council members to serve on governing bodies so that there is a good link with the LEA schools in their boroughs. I do not envisage a problem in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the important point that I wish to make. The provision would not compel councils to abolish their education committees; it would simply allow them, if they so wished, to have a different method of organising them.

Opposition Members speak of local democracy. What could be more democratic than allowing a local council to make its own decision on how to organise its committees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With my hon. Friend's experience of local government he may be able to tell me whether there is a statutory necessity for councils such as Norwich city council or Norfolk county council to have a housing or any other committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important question, which I have asked myself throughout this debate. As far as I am aware, it is only in education that there is a statutory responsibility to have a specific committee. It is right to allow local authorities to decide what committees they should have. I accept many of the Opposition's points; if I were on a local council I would argue against getting rid of my education committee. However, councillors who take the opposite view must also have the right to decide. In that sense, this is purely a permissive clause and we should accept it on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be brief, especially as my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend has already covered many of my points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not intend to make another speech in Committee but I want to go on record as opposing the clause, which is an act of barbarism in the largest education Bill ever to come before Parliament. The clause is the shortest, but one of the worst.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to escape the notion that the Government have a hidden agenda. The abolition of education committees will be permitted. The ball game has changed. At the beginning, there was an option for schools to opt out; we now learn from the newspapers—not through a proper, parliamentary channel—that that will change. The Secretary of State intends to table amendments to force schools to hold ballots and not to leave matters to local democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only 700 out of 25,000 schools have opted out; the avalanche has not happened. It has been a fiasco of a policy. If Conservative Members force schools to hold ballots, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that in future sectors of schools will be forced to opt out and the balloting process will be abolished. The possibility of abolition of education committees is part of the hidden agenda to remove democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The timing is interesting as local government in England and Wales is being reorganised. Few existing education committees on local authorities will be abolished, but it is a different matter if the local authority is abolished. For example, in my county the county council is the education authority for the 14 district councils. The 14 districts want unitary status and to become education authorities. It is unlikely that they will achieve that aim or that the Boundary Commission for England will leave Lancashire county council as the existing LEA. The more likely option is that there will be four or five new education authorities. That is when the clause will come into effect. It is difficult to abolish existing education committees, but if new authorities are created the position will be different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Schools is not present; he is fond of saying to the Committee, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." That applies to education committees, which were set up more than 90 years ago—before that there were school boards—under the Elementary
	<span class='label label-info column'>1398</span>
Education Act 1902. The hon. Member for Croydon, North-East, (Mr. Congdon) worked on an education committee and he said that the system works well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It provides a forum for elected councillors and others to discuss an area's education provision. One of the most important elements in the work of education committees is the involvment of people from the Churches and the voluntary sector. The Government spend much time bemoaning the decline of moral standards in our society, so it is interesting that they will be responsible for removing representatives from the Churches and the voluntary school sector from education committees. It is important for the children that the elected members and officers on the education committees should be experts and should understand what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude by examining a couple of the residual functions that will remain with education authorities, even in the unlikely event that every school in an area chooses to opt out. My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend spoke about special needs and I shall concentrate first on the educational psychology service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Educational psychologists are the best qualified local authority employees, being required to complete a minimum training period of seven years. That comprises three years working on a first degree, one year of teacher training, at least two years acquiring teaching experience and another year, at least, acquiring a Masters degree in education psychology. The average training period for educational psychologists is longer than the seven-year minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that people who have such a crucial role in the education of children with special needs should be so highly trained, but to whom will they be accountable if the local authority scraps the education committee? I hope that the Minister will tell the Committee. Will it be the leisure committee or the social services committee? I understand that Hillingdon has made its education services responsible to the social services committee. Social services committees are a statutory function of local authorities, like education committees at present, but their duties are laid down in the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970. Extra functions can be taken on by a social services committee only by means of a written decision by the Secretary of State for Health. It is crazy that the Secretary of State for Health, not the Secretary of State for Education, will decide whether a social services committee can oversee the special education provision of a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education committees also oversee the work of educational welfare officers. Every so often, during a lull in the news, a Minister will pop up on the television and mouth some platitudes about the seriousness of the problem of truancy. The Government have failed utterly to get to grips with the underlying causes of truancy; they have devised no response to the problem. They have left a vacuum of leadership that must be filled and the people to do it are local authority officers with the appropriate expertise. That service needs more investment and training. If responsibility for the work of educational welfare officers were handed over to social services or leisure committees, their expertise would be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been locked in Committee Room 10 for almost three months to consider a bad Bill. At the end of a bad Bill, we find one of the worst clauses. I hope that it will be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to utter a few well-chosen sentences in reply to the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat: the clause will lead to the disappearance of the statutory requirement to establish an education committee. It will also require the exercise of the Secretary of State's authority, by the making of a statutory order, when a joint education committee is created. The clause will not compel local education authorities to abolish their education committees, if they wish to retain them, but it will give authorities that want to make different arrangements for discharging their education functions the freedom to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North looked ahead to local government reorganisation in Wales. That process is fairly advanced. It will lead to the creation of new unitary authorities. Under the Bill they will be able to establish education committees, if they wish, or make other arrangements. The hon. Gentleman anticipated the creation of a lead authority in education, which would collaborate with neighbouring authorities. He should consider that the great beauty of the clause is that it will give unitary authorities the flexibility that they will need following reorganisation. They will be able to form such committees as they think fit and necessary. It will be up to them to decide on the arrangements that they wish to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see that the adoption of the role of lead authority by some authorities should inhibit others and reduce their requirement to establish education committees. One can create an education committee, and discuss within it the propriety of entering into a collaborative agreement with a lead authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, it is entirely a matter for the authority. That is the point of the clause. It enables authorities to make decisions and arrangements as they see fit. They can establish an individual education committee under the Local Government Act 1972, joint committees or whatever other form they feel should be established.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education (Mr. Tim Bos well)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: After that debate, I feel a little less than my usual kind and charitable self. We have spent a long time on a rather minor point, without shedding much light on it. I except from that the distinguished contribution made by my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, which usefully clarified several points, the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea and the speech of my hon. Friend for Croydon, North-East. They were to the point and considerably shorter than the speeches that preceded them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most interesting and possibly the most intellectual comment on the speech of the hon. Member for Bridgend, whom I hold in considerable affection, was the sounding of the alarm when he was about halfway through his speech. I thought that it was trying to tell us something. I shall now get on with the debate in exactly the way that one or two Opposition Members were unable to do. I preface my remarks by saying that I have noticed during the sittings that Opposition Members have a covert but ill-disguised reluctance to confront the issue of testing and are not interested in hard questions. We shall not rehearse the argument again, but I clearly remember that they failed to tackle the hard questions during the discussion on testing
	<span class='label label-info column'>1400</span>
under clause 213 and the debate on this clause, which both pose what I may term rigorous A-level questions. The Opposition's arguments have been ill-conceived and inappropriate to the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speech of the hon. Member for Bridgend contained a degree of not chaos and confusion, but continuing confusion. For example, he thought that if the committees were no longer statutory, their duties, procedures or membership—I know not which—should be set down in either legislation or guidelines. That is perhaps less than precise. He also confused the statutory duties of local education authorities with their powers. In particular, he confused the issue of whether, under their powers they could choose to set up education committee. He muddled the continuing duty to provide specified services for education, and to be accountable to Parliament under the law for such provision, with a possible shift in the pattern of committee responsibility and democratic accountability for the adequate delivery of those services. He also, in common with the hon. Member for Devonport, confused the optional abolition of the education committees prescribed in the clause with the abolition of local education authorities or the removal of their duties, which has nothing whatever to do with the clause. The only thing that Opposition Members did not suggest was that there is a proposal to do away with schools themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an extremely important point. Part II of schedule 1 of the 1944 Act will be abolished by the clause. If a local authority decides to move surveillance of its educational responsibilities to another committee—presumably it will continue to be carried out in some way—what obligation will there be for that authority to ensure that that committee has the appropriate expertise? In part II of schedule 1, the committee members are specifically required to have educational expertise. Does the Bill provide that educational expertise must be held by the new committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of abolishing the requirement under part II of schedule 1 is no longer to specify the composition of committees, as the 1944 Act does—I shall consider the history in a moment—but to replace that provision with an option for the local authority to choose whatever structure it deems appropriate, bearing in mind that it must continue to discharge its duties, such as to statement special educational needs and to provided school transport. The clause makes no change in the duties. The way in which they are apportioned to the various committees is a matter for the council, which is responsible for discharging its statutory duties, as my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that I heard the hon. Member for Bridgend say that the Government are getting rid of LEAs. I assure the Committee that that is not the case under any of the proposals in the Bill, and the clause merely relates to the ordering of the LEAs' affairs in relation to whether statutory education committees are needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To come to the substance of the argument, there has never been an automatic identity between LEA functions, or the existence of education committees, and the county councils or other authorities that may deliver education. I believe that county councils were founded in 1889, because all of them recently celebrated centenaries. I made inquiries and I understand that the education committees were first specified in the Elementary Education Act 1902, passed at the time of Balfour and an earlier Conservative
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0880">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1401</span>
Government. They were established in modern form under the 1944 Act. Therefore, there is no logical link with county councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister concede that LEAs were established in 1902 because the Act to which he referred abolished school boards that had directly elected representatives? The feeling at that time was that, to strengthen local democracy, there was a need for directly elected local education authorities. The Minister is proposing to remove a particular provision from the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bos well</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman needs to reflect on the fact that there is nothing more democratic than the wishes of parents expressed in ballots. Parents may make that choice, but if a school wishes to stay with an LEA and it continues to maintain that school, the LEA is accountable to its electors for the decisions that it takes in respect of that school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that ballots for schools to opt out strengthen democracy. One set of parents may vote for a school to opt out, and if it does there is no longer democratic accountability because the community has no say in the matter. It is a one-vote trade, for no vote at all. How does that strengthen democracy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter of opinion, given the attitude shown by the hon. Gentleman throughout our proceedings, I am not surprised that he has not changed his views. I intend to discuss the clause even if the hon. Gentleman does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How on earth does the Minister justify his claim that the new system of grant-maintained schools funded by the funding agency for schools is the height of democratic accountability and freedom when the funding agency and the funding council in Wales will have as much power in relation to schools as LEAs now have? They will have discretion to dispose of as much funding as they wish by means of special purpose grants and so on, so they will have greater powers than LEAs under the LMS system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that that is the intention of our proposals. Matters relating to the funding agency have been extensively debated and I have read accounts of those debates although I did not have the pleasure of taking part in them. Perhaps I may be allowed to explain the operation of clause 245 and its relevance to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not surprised that the debate should have strayed wider than the title of the clause, but it should be about the abolition of the requirement to establish education committees. I make that definition in criticising the speech of the hon. Member for Bridgend, but I need to put a little more light, shade and flesh on the dry and terse proposal in clause 245. Understandably, the hon. Gentleman became rather excited about the possibility that a decision by a local authority to abolish its education committee would remove democratic accountability. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State wisely offered advice to the Committee—which I can confirm—when he said that the alternative provision for the establishment of a committee to deal with education duties was contained in the Local Government Act 1972.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers to establish committees are contained in sections 101 and 102 of the 1972 Act, but section 100 provides that members of the public must be admitted to local authority committee meetings and be entitled to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1402</span>
inspect the minutes. It may be of comfort to the hon. Gentleman to hear that under schedule 2 of the 1944 Act people can be charged a maximum of 5p—I suspect that it was one shilling when the Act was originally printed—whereas under the Local Government Act, they may not be charged at all. Thus, the position for the general public who wish to have the information will be improved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the 1972 Act and the alternative provision for council committees. The Bill will disband education committees, the role of which will be taken on by other committees if councils so decide. Schedule 1 to the 1944 Act guarantees that people interested and involved in education will form the majority of members of education committees. Is there a similar guarantee in the 1972 Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not proposing a restrictive definition. We are leaving it to the local authority to decide what is appropriate. It will be accountable to its electors if they consider that its action was inappropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 places a requirement on authorities to have social service committees. Such a requirement refers only to social services and education. Clearly, the Government continue to believe that the issues covered by social services departments are so important that specific committees must be set up to deal with them. If the Government did not believe that, they could have removed such a power under the Children Act 1989. What is the difference between education committees and social services committees that make the latter so special with regard to children, while education committees are deemed less important?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government consider that it is no longer necessary to compel local authorities to have education committees. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] We are not making the decision whether or not they should have committees. They can continue to do so on the 1944 basis, if they so wish. We do not propose to compel them to continue as they have been obliged to do for nearly 50 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that it would be up to local authorities to decide and that they could have the same composition of education committees as that based on the Education Act 1944. When will the hon. Gentleman introduce amendments to allow co-option?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that the requirement would be based on the 1944 Act, as amended, and as it is in force at present. That is where we stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That the Government will enable local authorities not to have education committees as set up under the 1944 Act is crucial. It is not good enough for them to say that they will leave it to local authorities to decide the matter. Provision should be made to ensure that committees that deal with education are comprised of members with the relevant interest and knowledge as implied in part II of schedule 1 to the 1944 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be a matter of good practice and it relates to church interests, with which I shall deal shortly. I remind the Committee that there is a distinction between what is desirable good practice and what we prescribe in statute at any particular time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0881">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1403</span>
The hon. Member for Bridgend expressed the fear that democratic accountability may be attenuated. The public will have the right not only to be admitted but to obtain minutes free of charge. Those provisions are slightly wider than those in the 1944 Act because they are not restricted to local government electors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also considered the arguments for the change. Not all the provisions in the schedule to the 1944 Act are still in force. That part of the Act which remains in force—until it is amended by the clause—is an obstacle because it requires LEAs to submit detailed arrangements for approval. Who has to give approval? In another context, we would be bitterly attacked because, under the 1944 Act, approval is given by the Secretary of State. The arrangements submitted must meet the requirements described in circulars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that the clause had no direct relevance to reform of or change in local government structure. However, there would be a certain advantage if, for example, there were a major change in the structure in any one area and it was felt that a joint committee would be appropriate for a smaller area. In that case, the authority would not have to ask the Secretary of State, but could make the arrangements itself in a flexible format.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is not designed to remove democratic accountability from the work of an LEA or to create a hole-in-the-corner alternative. We do not propose to compel local education authorities to follow a particular route. They can take the decisions that they wish. That is a sensible approach because it enables authorities that want to make different arrangements for the discharge of their functions to have the freedom to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked the Minister whether he could provide specific examples in which the duty on an LEA to establish an education committee had proved to be an obstacle to the discharge of its functions. What examples can he give us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can deal with that by referring to what the London borough of Hillingdon is considering. It cannot make changes because it is constrained by the current legislation and it will not be able to do so unless and until the Bill is enacted. It is already considering how best to use the freedom provided by the clause so that it can develop its education policies and organisation. It has already achieved a fairly substantial move to grant-maintained status for secondary schools as a result of parental ballot, but that is not the only reason for its decision to review policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister therefore confirm that the sole purpose of the clause is to allow Tory local councils to abolish their education committees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect—and with great patience—I cannot understand how the hon. Gentleman can put that construction on the clause. I was at pains to say that it is up to LEAs to decide what they want to do. The hon. Gentleman interrupted me in the middle of my explanation, which was a reply to the hon. Member for Bridgend, and introduced a bit of Warrington waffle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point made by the hon. Member for Bridgend. The current intention of the Hillingdon education authority is to establish a joint education and social services committee in the autumn of this year. In the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1404</span>
light of this legislation and the authority's current plans, it is still considering whether to establish separate sub-committees dealing with education and social services. It clearly could do so. That might be a sensible proposition, but it is up to the authority to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of voting rights. He referred to people with expertise in education. A more precise matter has caused some concerns among representatives of the Churches because embedded rights are removed. We should take that issue head on: there is no doubt about it and I do not want to confuse the committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there any provision in existing legislation that would prevent Hillingdon from maintaining its education committee and its social services committee as required while setting up a joint sub-committee of those two committees to deal with the overlap of responsibility for children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would need to know whether such an arrangement would fulfil the authority's statutory duties. I did not set those remarks in that context. Under the new arrangements, I see no reason why it could not do that, but that might produce a very formal, rather inflexible and complex committee structure. There are proposals to consider the governance of local authorities. There should be a move towards greater simplification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) referred to the statutory need for a social services committee. Does Hillingdon intend to maintain its separate social services committee but to have another hybrid committee to deal with educational and other matters that affect children but are outside the scope of the social services committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be for Hillingdon to make its own arrangements. I cannot give a precise account because Hillingdon does not have a final view on how it intends to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to pursue this matter. The Minister says that a statutory education committee prevents an education authority having a flexible committee structure, but it seems to me that the most important area of overlap in education is social services for younger children. If the system is to work satisfactorily, either education has to be subsumed by the social services committee or the statutory right of the social services committee has to be removed and the committee replaced by some hybrid committee to carry out those functions collectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are reaching the final clause of this long and complex Bill. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we have no proposals to change local arrangements for social services committees. It will be for the local authority to decide within the statutory framework. Without doubt, this provision will give the local authority a mesure of flexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press the Minister, but the conclusion that must be drawn is that if an authority is determined to get rid of its education committee to provide flexibility, the only solution is for it to be part of the social services committee because that is a statutory freestanding committee. What is the alterrnative? There is no plan to give local authorities the option of getting rid of the social services committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, that is not a decision for the Government; it is for local authority. Secondly, whether a statutory committee exists—for example, the police committee, which was set up by statute—the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way as I have not finished my sentence, which directly answers the point put by the hon. Member for Bridgend. Whether there is a statutory committee, and how specified the conditions are under which that committee was set up, is an entirely different matter from whether a local authority may make a voluntary decision to redispose its educational duties in another direction. That is a decision that it should make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point about who takes the decision—for example, to abolish an education committee and to transfer those functions to a social services committee—I may be mistaken, but I understand that social services committees can carry out only certain functions by statute. Any extra functions that the council may want to give the committee, such as educational functions, require the permission of the Secretary of State for Health. The decision will therefore be taken not by the local authority, but by the Secretry of State for Health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under present arrangements, the intervention of the Secretary of State for Health would indeed be required before that could happen. However, there can be no doubt that, whatever the precise statutory framework that exists at present, the amendments that will be introduced by the Bill will make the arrangements more flexible for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I owe it to the hon. Member for Bridgend to conclude my point about the Churches. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has recently written to the Bishop of Guildford saying that he will take careful account of the nominations put forward by the Church of England and by the other Churches for membership of the funding agency for schools. Although we do not formally wish to reserve places for particular interests, we recognise that the interests of voluntary schools should be taken into account. That would be good practice for any local authority in relation to any committee structure that it chooses to determine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not prevent local authorities from involving the Churches fully in the work of committees dealing with education matters, however those committees are designated. I am sure that authorities recognise the value of that work and of the Church-maintained and voluntary schools, and would want it to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is saying that the Government are in favour of representatives of the Churches being co-opted members of education or equivalent committees when those are set up. Will there be a more positive direction from his Department and the Welsh Office to local authorities for that purpose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Churches will have taken note of our exchanges in Committee. There will be opportunities for further consultation on the matter. The clause will provide greater flexibility for local authorities. We believe that that is the right approach to enable them to tailor their arrangements to their changing circumstances. The decision is finally for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the long and rather discursive debate that we have had, it seems that the Opposition, who are concerned
	<span class='label label-info column'>1406</span>
about rights, proprieties and the valuable role that local education authorities play, are looking a gift horse in the mouth. This short, technical clause will provide greater flexibility and autonomy for local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason I did not respond to the hon. Gentleman's question is that it has not the slightest relevance to the clause.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I recall that Sir John Hunt once said that it is the tradition in Committees for every hon. Member to give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Gentlemen who wish to make a speech may make one following mine. I was concluding with a final sentence which may assist the hon.

I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With those bowdlerised words of Rousseau ringing in my ears, I say that there was not much comfort in the Minister's speech. I accept that under alternative arrangements in the 1972 Act there is still the opportunity for electors to obtain copies of minutes of whatever committee deals with educational matters. Part II of schedule 1 to the 1944 Act provides that there should be members with expertise on an education committee. That system could be removed by any education authority that decided to put its educational function at the behest of some other committee. There could thus be few members on that committe with the educational experience laid down in the 1944 Act. In the guise of freedom, the clause will put education in a second-class position.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment removes the requirement that orders made under clause 244 should be by statutory instrument. Those are local orders within the Secretary of State's discretion and are unlikely to be controversial, so it is not thought appropriate that they should be treated as statutory instruments. I remind hon. Members that orders made under clause 244 extend the power of LEAs, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Schools said this morning, to provide specified goods and services to grant-maintained schools in specified areas up to a two-year period.

The Committee has debated the Bill exhaustively and it is appropriate that such provisions be introduced at the correct time without further parliamentary scrutiny.

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee, but I wish to ask the Under-Secretary of State
	<span class='label label-info column'>1408</span>
for Further and Higher Education about the contracts of employment for teachers who at present are employed by LEAs but who will be employed by grant-maintained schools as a result of the opting-out process. An earlier debate, before the Under-Secretary was drafted on to the Committee, referred to the Woodroffe school in Lyme Regis, Dorset. That school opted out of LEA control and got into severe financial difficulties—it was about £80,000 in the red. It suspended its head teacher and seven other teachers, but the resultant contractual problems were so severe that the school ended up sacking those members of staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has already said that he would not want to intervene to prevent a school from making members of staff redundant if it had decided to do so. However, recently the Under-Secretary of State for Schools told the Select Committee on Education that he did not think that it was necessarily damaging for a school to lose an experienced teacher and replace that teacher with a more junior member of staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The educational merits of that statement are clearly open to debate, but there can be no doubt that losing his or her job will damage the experienced teacher profoundly. That teacher's rights must be taken into account. I noticed that the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) quivered like a pointer a moment or two ago, although his interest seemed to abate when I said that I was motivated by anxiety over teachers' contracts. However, I should be interested to hear the Under-Secretary's explanation of the Government's attitude to a school's decision to replace experienced teachers with more junior staff. Large-scale redundancies will result from financial difficulties and, as LEAs go through their budgetary rounds, I suppose that many will find it necessary to make teaching posts redundant. But it may make sense to the management of a GM school to replace one teacher with another for reasons of cost imperatives—it will be cheaper to employ a more junior teacher than an experienced one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The educational damage that such action might cause is worthy of debate, but the matter was raised in the Select Committee by my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg). I am worried about the contractual rights of teachers. An LEA that decided to move a teacher would offer redeployment. That would not happen in the opted-out structure.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a little like an Australian soap opera—the following day there is a recap. Before we broke for dinner, I was saying that grant-maintained schools have already chosen to make staff redundant. Other GM schools have chosen to get rid of more experienced and, therefore, more expensive members of staff and replace them with younger ones. Will the Minister latch on to that fact?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To paraphrase the Minister's comments to the Select Committee, he said that it was not necessarily damaging for schools to employ inexperienced teachers. While it may be debated that such decisions have educational merits, the teachers who are made unemployed in such circumstances have contractual rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0884">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1409</span>
I want to draw the Minister's attention to what has happened in several other GM schools. There have been cases where teachers have not been sacked, but have had their terms and conditions fundamentally altered. Stoneleigh first school in Surrey, for example, prior to opting out had operated under Surrey education authority's terms and conditions. After the school had opted out, however, new teachers—even those with many years' service—would be entitled only to the sick pay and sick leave entitlement of starting teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for the Minister to take heed of that particular example. At first, the school apparently did not feel obliged to recognise that new teachers may have had many years' service in other schools. For sick pay and sick leave entitlement, they were treated as though they were brand new teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That problem may have been resolved by now by negotiation with the National Union of Teachers. I am not sure about that, so I do not want to stigmatise that school. However, I do want to point out to the Minister that such problems arise. I also point out to him that, while it would not be illegal to allow a school to operate in that way, it would be bad behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example is Southlands school in Reading, where the governors refused to recognise, for employment protection purposes, the sick pay entitlement, and maternity leave of new staff with previous service. In addition, the school introduced a probationary period for newly qualified staff despite the fact that the statutory probationary period no longer exist in schools. There are, therefore, already GM schools where terms and conditions of service have been significantly eroded, sometimes to the point of dismissal, other times to the point where there is a different employment contract on offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that the Minister will refer us to the terms of the acquired rights directive and the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill. I have yet to be persuaded that the directive is as marvellous as even some members of the Labour party consider it to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My scepticism is due to the fact that the directive gives a guarantee of continuity of contract of employment, but that continuity is only as good as is permitted after the new organisation takes on the responsibility as an employer. It is able to abrogate the contract of employment in the same way as many other employers do in many different circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it would help the Committee, I could talk at considerable length about the way in which the newspaper and printing industry has torn up contracts left, right and centre. Indeed, that has happened in manufacturing industry throughout the country. However, were I to go into that at too great a length, you, Mr. Martin, would say that I was moving the debate away from the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to emphasise that the contract of employment is not a strong protection for teachers or for any employees. It is not satisfactory simply to say that we have the acquired rights directive and that more legislation is pending. Nor is it satisfactory to say that teachers will have recourse to industrial tribunals. They offer little protection. For example, no industrial tribunal has the power to order reinstatement. Therefore, a teacher whose contrtact is severely altered to an extent that the teacher believes it is constructive dismissal will, de facto, be dismissed. There might be monetary compensation, but nothing more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1410</span>
I hope that the Minister realises that a real issue is involved. It is important that he accepts or rejects what I have to say. There is great concern about the basis of employment contracts in Britain. It has been debated in Committees, such as this one, for many years and the Opposition will return to that issue again and again. However, it is specific here and now in terms of teachers' contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to explain to the Minister that the accusation that will be made about him and the Government will be that they choose to undermine the terms and conditions of employment in order to run a cheaper school. If that is the Government's intention, it should be placed in the record. If it is not, we want some protection because none is provided in existing law or in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to my points. I appreciate that it is more difficult to do that on a clause stand part debate, especially on what is a slightly technical matter. I apologise for that. We wanted to raise the issue on a previous clause, but were prevented from doing so by the guillotine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman casts himself in the role of the terrier harrying me in the Committee. If he feels comfortable in that role, I concede it to him. Conversely, I suspect that the problem is that of slow learning. We rehearsed and visited those issues extensively when we debated clause 31 (6) and subsequent clauses. I shall have one more go at explaining matters. I have, of course, listened to what the hon. Gentleman has said and I shall endeavour to answer his questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will not be surprised if I answer his general points in the order that he asked them. The first line of defence for a teacher in a school is his contract of employment, which is automatically transferred if the school becomes grant-maintained. There is always continuity on transfer. If the employer subsequently unilaterally defaults or makes significant changes to the contract, the teacher can refuse the altered contract, resign and claim constructive dismissal before an industrial tribunal. The hon. Gentleman is aware of that, although I concede that there is no right of reinstatement thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New staff can accept or reject a preferred contract, but the contract transfers intact and, as the hon. Gentleman said, the right of recourse to an industrial tribunal will remain the same as that of any other employee whose contract is transferred. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the acquired rights directive. He was sceptical about how widely it applies, but I remind the Committee that it has been in force since 1981—even if not enacted in the terms that are being discussed in another Committee—and is certainly in force now. If a teacher transfers to a grant-maintained school and decisions such as those that we have discussed are taken by governors and employers in that school, that is his protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that, although the form of employment varies with practice, employment in schools subject to local management—soon to be all schools—works in the same way. As I think I have already mentioned, I am aware of at least one school in my constituency that has a high complement of mature staff. That school experienced difficulties with the funding formula and, because the local authority was unable to overcome the problem by changing the formula—although it made efforts to do so—the school decided to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0885">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1411</span>
take action and declared two teachers redundant. That was under LMS. The broad application is no different to that which would apply under GM status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest to the wisdom of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Schools in his comments to the Select Committee on Employment. He said—I paraphrase his remarks—that it was not necessarily a disadvantage to replace experienced teachers with more junior ones. Clearly, that depends on the nature of the school and its staffing complement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can debate whether that is disadvantageous to a school, but will the hon. Gentleman concede that, at least prima facie, it is a serious disadvantage to the teacher who is sacked?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That entirely depends on the circumstances, but it does not apply only to schools with grant-maintained status. It could apply to a school under local management. If Opposition Members wish to remove the whole structure of local management and reintroduce local education authority control, I should be interested to hear their arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the Minister. The Opposition and many people in the profession believe it would help if the Government acknowledged the real cost of teachers in LMS rather than considering only average costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That suggestion has been extensively debated. Changes in employment protection may be desirable in certain cases, but they are not always without cost. I do not intend to debate the general issues of employment law tonight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath) recently castigated a Conservative Chancellor—so I am being entirely broadminded—as being a one-club golfer. I am beginning to wonder whether the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) is a one-school whinger. For the third time, I think, he has mentioned the Woodroffe school in Dorset, which inherited a £70,000 deficit from the local education authority. The figures given by the hon. Gentleman to the Committee tonight suggest that the school is still in the same position, neither worse nor better. Given the acquired deficit, it is hardly surprising that the governors had to take action to remedy the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have defined the employment terms and conditions that deal with the problem raised by the hon. Gentleman. The rights of teachers are broadly consisted with the general law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I paraphrase the Minister? He is saying that if a school takes a managerial decision, for whatever reason, to alter terms and conditions to the detriment of a teacher or to sack a teacher, the Government accept that as perfectly reasonable and will do nothing to prevent it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I honestly begin to wonder whether the hon. Gentleman should become a lawyer. He is trying to put words into my mouth. I do not mean to offend the legal profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to say that, in such circumstances, a person's contract is automatically transferred and,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1412</span>
thereafter, that person has rights under the general law. It is entirely possible for school managers and governors to have regard to their responsibility and to meet their budgets. That duty is no different from that which they would have under LMS. They must take account of the deficit and the need to maintain an even budget. I have managed people and represented the farmers union, so I have some knowledge of negotiating with Government and of complaining about them on occasion. I am not talking about the previous Government only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking account of circumstances and dealing with them in a sensitive and effective manner is good management practice. I do not belong to the school of thought of employers who say, "There it is; take it or leave it and see you in court." Governors have a right and a duty to take decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first line of defence is through the general law and the provision for transfer of contracts, which I have now explained on, I think, three occasions. Far more important is what is actually happening with grant-maintained schools. The hon. Member for Stretford mentioned a particular case—although, in fairness, he also mentioned others. I do not want to minimise the fact that certain schools may have particular problems. However, for the generality of grant-maintained schools, I refer again to the survey that covered 100 of them. That was approximately one third of the total, so the survey covered a representative and wide sample. The reality in terms of staffing and staff morale is quite different from what the hon. Gentleman described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On staffing ratios, 100 per cent. of primary schools, of which there were 25 in the survey, and 77 per cent. of secondary schools employ more teachers, not fewer. The average increase in the number of teachers in every grant-maintained school was 1.5 in a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been an increase in the number of administrative staff and classroom support staff. Several schools commented on how GM status had enabled them to sustain establishments where neighbouring LEA schools had not and had, presumably, run into the sort of difficulties to which the hon. Member for Stretford referred. For example, one Birmingham school reported
	<br><blockquote><p>"8 teachers over Birmingham counterparts."</p></blockquote>
A rural, presumably secondary, school
	<br><blockquote><p>"retained 8–10 teachers we would have lost."</p></blockquote>
The survey showed that staff turnover has generally reduced. Nine schools—that is, nine per cent.—reported dramatic reductions. Schools commented—this is anecdotal evidence—on the high quality of staff applying for jobs, saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have noticed a significant increase in the number of staff applications for posts."</p></blockquote>
Another comment was "Better fields of candidates".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The turnover in grant-maintained primary schools—a small number so far—is extremely low. The only changes reported for last year were that five teachers were promoted; in four schools, staff retired and two schools, as I have already reminded the Committee, lost staff for maternity reasons. Frankly, those figures are good news for grant maintained schools. It shows positive employment. It gives the lie to the anxieties which the hon. Gentleman expressed. That, together with the rights that I set out, seem a satisfactory response to the points that he made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister's response was no more satisfactory. I spoke of the concerns of teachers in a certain type of school. Even if they are a minority, they are still real schools with real people working in them. The Minister's cavalier attitude to those who have given service to their schools is sad and quite disgraceful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect, the Government are saying that teachers who find that they have severely worsened terms and conditions are on their own. The Government will not lift a finger to help them and, apparently, are not even concerned about them. That message will go out from this Committee. It will make teachers who face the prospect of their school opting out at least a little more anxious about whether there will be any positive benefits to them as individual employees and to the overall community that they service.

Although it is not appropriate for us to vote against the clause because of its nature, I must register my strong disappointment of the Minister's unsatisfactory remarks.

Let us consider the following circumstances: more than 10 per cent. of pupils in the primary or secondary sector in an LEA area attend grant-maintained schools, and the finding authority shares responsibility for admission arrangements with the LEA. The LEA decides that it is appropriate to place an attendance order on a child who attends a school in another LEA. Why should the involvement of the funding authority in the first LEA preclude consultation about the attendance order with the other LEA? Why should the other LEA have no opportunity to seek direction from the Secretary of State if it is unhappy with the attendance order? That does not make sense, yet paragraph 15 provides for that.

	<br><blockquote><p>'49A. In section 3 there is inserted "The instrument of government shall provide for one of the co-opted governors above to be a representative of the interests of the residential community served by the school.".'.</p></blockquote>
I shall not detain the Committee long on this amendment. Nevertheless, it is significant and important. We propose to amend the Education (No. 2) Act 1986 to ensure that one of the co-opted governors under that Act is a representative from the local residential community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my hobbyhorses is the importance of regarding the local community and the school as a single entity. Many children at secondary school—certainly in my area—live locally. Therefore, their parents and the parent governors are also local and there is a strong sense of community. However, if the Government are successful in providing choice and diversity—about which we have heard so much—children might need to travel considerable distances to go to their parents' choice of school. Very few children might be local and there may be no local representatives on the governing body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The link between the local community and the school is important for various reasons. The community provides an important framework within which the school can operate. If children feel that they are part of the local community, that provides a good basis for ensuring good behaviour outside as well as inside the school. For children not to feel isolated when they are outside the school gates is an important part of the education system. We often hear about children behaving badly outside the school, because they do not have responsibility to the local community. That is a great pity. We must strengthen the links between the local community and the school to ensure that that does not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to another reason why the local community must be involved with the school and vice versa. As large organisations, schools can provide pressures within a community. One pressure with which members of the Committee will be familiar is that of car parking problems, especially for parents who travel some distance to bring their children to school. That may sound trivial, but I have seen more battles take place at school gates over car parking than almost any other issue. The hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West (Mr. Richards) is shaking his head. I do not know whether he is disagreeing with me or whether he has not encountered such problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just saying to my colleague that it is not unknown in the United States for people to pull a gun in an argument about car parking. However, I should not imagine that that usually involves parents. I have not seen it happen in England, and I hope that the hon. Lady agrees that it should not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, it should not happen. The lack of car parking facilities outside schools causes problems, especially for those who travel a long distance to school. Parents collect their children, then drive away, perhaps ignoring pedestrians and cyclists, and thus create a dangerous situation. The lack of car parking provision causes great stress and conflict among parents and the local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stress can be caused if a school, especially a grant-maintained school, decides to dispose of land or buildings. Having been involved with schools for the past 20 years, I have encountered problems when the sale of land caused tremendous conflict in the local community, sometimes almost as great as the conflict caused by school closures. School playing fields are usually nice green
	<span class='label label-info column'>1418</span>
spaces, and it is beneficial for members of a local community to live in houses that back on to them. If a school or a local education authority decides to dispose of that land, much anguish is caused to the local community. There are several physical reasons why it is important to recognise that interaction between the local community and the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community education within a school is an important tradition in my county. Some hon. Members may consider it boring that I keep talking about my authority in Cambridgeshire. However, it is the one that I know best and it was one of the pioneers of community education many years ago. Our secondary schools in the city of Cambridge offer community education courses, which are valued enormously by the local adult community. Sadly, however, given the recent round of SSA settlements, the county councils in Cambridgeshire are finding them difficult to sustain. I refer to a community education report from the school of which I used to be a governor, which my children attended—Parkside community college in Cambridge. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We know that the County Council plans to make a cut of some £400,000 in the Community Education Budget from 1 April 1993 … This is less than the £600,000 cut originally threatened"—</p></blockquote>
It was reduced because of the enormous outcry from the community—
	<br><blockquote><p>"but it still represents a substantial proportion of the budget, and indicates cuts whose impact will be much more than superficial … As well as possible cuts to budgets, they will also take the form of reductions in full time professional posts and/or in secretarial assistance. All Community Education Staff are to receive formal notice of redundancy imminently, and full-time Professional staff over the age of 50 years have been invited to consider accepting voluntary redundancy."</p></blockquote>
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That report is very sad. Fortunately such reports are not sent every term to the governing body of my local secondary school. However, it gives a flavour of the interaction between the adult education community within the school and the school itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is distressing for those of us who believe that community education is important and hold it dear to our hearts that the subject is not mentioned in the Government's proposals. It is curious that Ministers do not recognise the great importance that adults place on community education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to recognise the interaction between the community and the schools by having a representative of the residential community on the school governing body. There is pressure on the community to produce responsible citizens, and the use of school buildings and land for adult community education is important in that respect. There should be someone on the governing body who can comment and advise the school when it is considering the sale of disposal of land that will affect the local community, and on changes to community education provision. I hope that the Committee will accept this sensible amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1419</span>
county council in community education. In so far as it is definable as adult education outside the provisions of schedule 2 to the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, it is now assigned to the Further Education Funding Council as so-called non-schedule 2 expenditure for adult education. That is currently covered by the local authorities settlement. Some authorities may have chosen to move money from that category to another item of expenditure, as they are entitled to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found the hon. Lady's point about the difficulty of car parking a little wry. I do not disagree that it is difficult to park, especially in rural areas where many of the Victorian schools were not designed for the motor car age. There are potential hazards. Most of the schools in my constituency are well defined with yellow lines outside. In another context, the Government are considering the possibility of imposing speed limits at critical times of the day, which would cover school entry and leaving times, for example. I find a wry satisfaction in the hon. Lady's remarks because the fact that many parents take their children to school by car is an index of the measure of prosperity in the community, not of falling living standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady referred to the involvement of the school with the local community. That is desirable, not just for community education, which the hon. Lady rightly emphasised, but for other matters such as local housekeeping, noise, inconvenience, traffic flow and a general feeling of involvement with the school. I have always been a keen supporter of getting the governors and heads of primary schools to agree to the occasional involvement of older people. Therefore, I agree with the spirit of the hon. Lady's remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am more sceptical about whether simply having a local community governor on the school would eliminate automatically causes of dispute. Let me take up the hon. Lady's point about the disposal of school premises. From all my experience of planning and development issues, which was sporadic, but lengthy, I find it hard to believe that trouble can be avoided. I was a manager and then, at the time it converted, a governor of a voluntary school that closed. We had endless difficulties in working that out and dealing with the proceeds of the eventual development. We must not be starry-eyed and expect all rows to disappear, whatever prescription the hon. Lady may bring forward. However, she did not put it in that spirit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason I advise my hon. Friends to resist the amendment relates to a recurrent theme of the Committee. Although we may agree on good practice, we are not always anxious to be specific in the Bill—that may not be appropriate for particular circumstances and may fetter the discretion of the local school. As the hon. Lady rightly said, the amendment would require the governing bodies of county, voluntary-controlled and maintained special schools to include a representative, although it would not affect grant-maintained, voluntary-aided or special agreement schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require that one of the co-opted governors be a representative of the interests of the residential community. The Education (No. 2) Act 1986 requires the governors of schools that have not been co-opted to co-opt between three and six governors, depending on the size of the school. They must ensure that at least one member of the local business community is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1420</span>
member of the governing body, whether by co-option or otherwise. We attach considerable importance to that because it is already making a significent contribution toward forging the links between education and business that are so essential for a successful society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister had a chance to examine the affairs of the governing body of Calday Grange grammar school in West Kirby? Steps were taken over a long time to stop the co-option of the governing body, yet at the same time meetings were held, for which seven days' notice had not been given, for the opt-out ballot that was to be rerun in the authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not considered that particular case. If allegations are being made of impropriety in the proceedings, they will be examined properly by my Department or, if more appropriate, by another body. If the hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that I have no knowledge of the case and I shall not comment on the use of his discretion by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. If anything illegal has been done, the hon. Gentleman could bring it to the attention of the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that there is nothing to stop the governors co-opting a representative of the local residential community served by the school if they consider that that would be valuable. That is perfectly reasonable and I remind the Committee that parent-governors, who comprise about a quarter of the governing body, will invariably belong to that community. The hon. Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) seems to doubt that because we had a discussion about cars, but I believe that most of them would live not too far away from the school. I understand why she made her point, which was consistent with those made in the Committee on several previous occasions. However, it would not be appropriate to include her proposal in statute, although it may be good practice in most cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of what I have said, I hope that the hon. Lady will seek leave to withdraw the amendment because I cannot advise the Committee to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make one or two points in reply to the Minister. The first relates to cuts in community education, which he felt must have meant that Cambridgeshire county council was taking money from community education and putting it elsewhere. If it was put anywhere, it would be towards special needs where there is a growing requirement for funds because of the increase in the number of children with statements in Cambridgeshire. Neither the Minister nor I would complain about increased expenditure on special educational needs, nevertheless it has meant that community education is suffering badly in comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made a point about car parking, saying that many parents were sufficiently affluent to own a car and that that might be a reflection of the times. A few parents with cars can create problems at school entrances and if 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. of them arrive by car and only a few are inconsiderate and park badly and dangerously, that can cause a tremendous upheaval in the relationship between the school and parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0890">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1421</span>
I cited that example because all of the schools of which I have been a governor have encountered problems arising from the parking of cars. The community governors have sorted out those problems by getting parents to realise how dangerous such behaviour could be. That is an important role for a governor who lives locally, is fully aware of the problems and knows many local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what the Minister said about planning and developmental issues. Of course, merely to appoint a local community governor would not solve the many problems that are caused if a school or a local education authority wishes to sell a school playing field or sports ground. However, it would help schools to get an initial reaction from the community and such governors could be used as sounding boards for any planning issue that the governing body might want to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that that is good practice. However, it may not be appropriate for all conditions and it is not always appropriate for representatives of the local business community to be represented on governing bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions are written into the 1986 Act. The local community used to be represented on governing bodies by district council representatives, but that is no longer a requirement. Many schools miss that representation, and the amendment would have replaced that local community representation with someone who resided in the community. I am disappointed that my amendment did not receive a more enthusiastic response from the Minister, but he will bear my ideas in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take Government new Clause 23—
	<i>Independent schools that are children's homes</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that the first time that I read new clause 23 I was not sure what it involved for independent schools that are also children's homes. Having had a brief word with civil servants and after checking section 63(6) of the Children Act 1989, I can see that the new clause will remove the detailed scrutiny that takes places in small registered boarding schools with fewer than 50 children, and which are inspected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause relates to schools that provide accommodation for more than three pupils and that are open for more than 295 days in one year. As most schools are open for less than that, the existing valuable protection for smaller establishments would be lost. The Government are seeking to replace the more stringent requirements of section 63 of the Children Act 1989 with a less onerous and more general requirement under section 87 of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That places the onus of responsibility on the owner or the head of the school to safeguard and promote the children's welfare. Under section 87(3) of the 1989 Act, the local authority
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall take such steps as are reasonably practicable Jo enable them to determine whether the child's welfare is adequately safeguarded and promoted."</p></blockquote>
It also enables the authority to visit and inspect when necessary. The likely effect of the new clause would be to reduce the frequency of inspections and the liability of the small independent school to pay a registration fee. Perhaps we should consider how the registration fee affects small schools, but I do not think that a good way to tackle that problem is to make the provisions of registration inspection less onerous. More than 8,000 children in about 300 small boarding schools would be affected by this less onerous registration and inspection. Why should that inspection regime differ from the regime that affects the 11,000 or so children in children's homes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The level of inspection would be less under the new clause than it is under section 63(6) of the 1989 Act. The inspection authorities would lose the fee for the inspection process. However, they may feel that, to be true to the children of those schools, they should maintain the level of inspection that is provided by section 63. I hope that, instead of pushing this measure through now, the Government will consult a little more widely with local education authorities and others. If the registration fee for small schools is a problem, the Government should tackle that. They should not remove the registration fee nor, at the same time, reduce the statutory protection currently provided by section 63(6).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak briefly in favour of new clause 23 and the amendment. The Children Act 1989 had several implications for independent schools. I declare an interest as I have many years of teaching experience in the independent sector and I am a governor of a small independent school in Norwich. Section 63 of the 1989 Act provides that schools with 50 or fewer boarders must register with their local authorities as children's homes. From my experience of talking to people who are involved in the independent sector and to people who are involved with education authorities—

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to your support, Mr. Martin. The Opposition raised a point and I thought that they would be interested to hear both sides of the argument.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee has been so good at this sitting. I hoped that hon. Members were not going to stray away. The hon. Gentleman is on his feet and it is common courtesy to give him a hearing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bridgend for raising this issue, which is one in which I have considerable interest and of which I have some experience. I have contact with people who, through their involvement with, independent schools have discovered anomalies that have resulted from section 63(6) of the 1989 Act. Section 63(6) is an arbitrary and unfair definition of boarding schools that has resulted in perfectly normal boarding schools being subjected to inappropriate requirements and being required to pay an often substantial charge for inspection
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have certainly found that it is widely acknowledged to be wrong to define schools as children's homes on that basis. A boarding school differs from a children's home in that, in the holidays, the pupils return to the care of their families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to speak at length. I want to assure the hon. Member for Bridgend that the effect of the Children Act 1989 on the smaller, independent boarding schools has been proven to be nonsense. That is not a controversy but an anomaly. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will confirm that that problem needs to be addressed. New clause 23 and the amendment are the right way to do that. I hope that the hon. Member for Bridgend accepts what I have said in good faith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a good-natured and constructive debate about a matter of concern. The hon. Member for Bridgend has performed a service in raising it. I should make it clear from the outset that the new clause has been agreed with Department of Health Ministers because it would amend legislation relevant to that Department. The new clause would amend the Children Act 1989 so that independent schools with boarders would have to register as children's homes only if, within a two-year period, more than three pupils remained for more than 295 days during both years. That would be irrespective of the number of pupils accommodated for shorter periods—in practice, those resident during term time. Amendment No. 584 is a technical amendment consequent on the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson) substantially argued the case. I shall explain briefly why. The present wording of section 23 of the Children Act 1989 requires a school to register with its local social services department as a children's home if it has 50 or fewer boarders. I remind the Committee that schools with more than 50 boarders still have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children which is enforceable under provisions in the education Acts. No one wants to overturn those provisions for smaller sized schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fewer than 50 rule has proved unsatisfactory and anomalous, and in my experience I know that to be true. It has just occurred to me, not having had the benefit of the debates on the Children Act 1989, that it is unusual to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0892">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1425</span>
define something not de minimis but de maximus, which would apply to the fewer than 50 rule. The requirement for children's home regulations was not intended to cover the many large independent schools with small boarding houses. Those are schools rather than homes and are covered by the schools test. The cut-off number of 50 is arbitrary and we have no evidence—if there were, I would consider it—that schools with 20 or 30 boarders require the level of social service department supervision appropriate to establishments that may be a child's main home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be occasions when an independent school acts in loco parentis for more than the normal term time. Some children may be accommodated during holidays and the new clause would affect that. A school that regularly homes children during holidays is closer to being a child's home. We have attempted to find a more suitable definition of the type of school that should be required to register as a home because, for all practical purposes, it is a home. The new clause would provide a reasonable test for that. If pupils usually return to their parents or guardians for 10 weeks or more, no registration would be required. That would make it unnecessary for the majority of the 250 or so schools registered to remain registered as homes. They would be in the same position as those schools with larger numbers of boarders. The amendment and the new clause are sensible and balanced and would correct an anomaly. I urge hon. Members to accept the new clause.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply. I do not pretend to be an expert, but I have heard representations expressing concern. I feel that there has been a lack of consultation. There have been many meetings but no formal consultation process. One person who contacted me said that she had expected consultation but had heard no more until new clause 23. If the Government are not prepared to consult, we should vote against the new clause.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief, although the amendment is important. The Further and Higher Education Act 1992 was amended in another place to allow for courses to teach independent-learning and communication skills to those with learning difficulties, in order to prepare them for other courses. That was welcomed by those involved in special needs education because it allowed for funding. However, it introduced an anomaly in that those who were severely deprived found themselves disadvantaged by the new arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am referring to people with profound and multiple learning difficulties, such as those who attend Orchard Hill further education centre. The typical student at that centre has extreme learning difficulties. I am advised that the World Health Organisation's definition of a person with profound mental handicap includes a person who scores 20 points or fewer in an IQ test and that all those at Orchard Hill fall within that definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Orchard Hill caters for three main categories of students: those with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities, those with severe and challenging behaviours and those with additional visual or hearing losses. They are people with the most profound learning difficulties and the most profound needs. The point at issue is that such institutions are expensive to run. In the London borough of Sutton, the unit costs of special educational needs institutions are some two and a quarter times as much as those of general education, and those of an institution such as Orchard Hill are three and a half times as much. By any standards, that is a very expensive institution to run, although, I must emphasise, it is a very worthwhile educational institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would allow the Further Education Funding Council to make funding available to such institutions. Unfortunately, because of the pressure of time, our debate must be limited but I want to impress on the Minister the importance of proper provision for that group of students at a time when the educational budgets of LEAs are under severe pressure and such institutions have reason to fear for their future. Unless the FEFC can fund them, money will not be available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hour is late, but the subject is important. It was well rehearsed during the passage of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992.

On behalf of all Committee members, may I thank you for the consideration that you have shown throughout the Committee's proceedings. Your guidance has been much appreciated, especially by new Members. I do not know whether the fact that the Bill does not relate to Scotland enhances your enjoyment of the debate. I should be relieved to discover that the Bill did not cover my constituency, but, unfortunately, it does. My new colleagues in particular appreciate the help and guidance that you have given, Mr. Martin, and we look forward to serving under your chairmanship on other Committees. Perhaps in future we shall be able to change sides on the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It has been a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, which has been a model of good humour combined with firmness and fairness. That has enabled the Committee to make progress, as we would all wish. New Members of the House have been able to learn a great deal during our proceedings. I hope that they will be able to serve under chairmanship of such quality in the future. I express my thanks and those of my colleagues to you.
