	<div class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Hood 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydesdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It did not have to be proved to me but the speeches from the Secretary of State and the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) certainly proved that the Conservative and Scottish National parties should have joined the Scottish Constitutional Convention. It is a great tragedy that they did not. They put their political self-interest before the interest of the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State made a speech in support of the status quo which no one wants. He was contradicted slightly by the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger). The debate in Scotland has been polarised by the intransigence of the Government and the Scottish national party. The case for home rule for Scotland has been put forward by the Scottish Constitutional Convention and the Labour party is committed to introduce home rule when in Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been treated to the dogmatic, head-in-the-sand politics of the Government. Tragically, even in the speech of the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan, which he will agree was not one of his best, there were tinges of the bigotry that has existed in the debate in support of the nationalist case. Some of the disparaging comments certainly do not help the debate and do not put the interests of our country and our people in their proper perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have often thought that the leadership of the Scottish National party should take the opportunity to distance themselves from some of the comments that have been made by their candidates up and down the country. A most disgraceful comment was made last week by a Mr. Lumsden, the prospective parliamentary SNP candidate in Midlothian, who urged elderly labour voters not to vote. That disgraceful comment questions the motives behind those who stand up as part of a democratic organisation. I have waited over a week for the Scottish National party to disown the candidate, but when the matter was raised on a point of order by my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) the parliamentary leader of the Scottish National party denied that the incident had taken place. I have the proof. In an article headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lumsden urges elderly voters to abstain",</p></blockquote>
the candidate is quoted as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I appeal to them to stay at home and let the younger generation decide the outcome."</p></blockquote>
If that is not a worrying feature of today's politics when we are talking about constitution and democracy, I do not know what is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the major television stations has selected my constituency of Clydesdale, describing it affectionately as
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
"Little Scotland", as a barometer constituency that will reflect what happens in Scotland. I welcome Scottish Television, the BBC or anyone else to Clydesdale. I am somewhat comforted by the thought that my constituents will reflect what will happen in Scotland. Some, obviously, do not share my view: some support the Scottish National party, some support the Conservatives and some support the Liberal Democrats. But basically the people of Clydesdale have something deep rooted which we all have throughout Scotland and that is decency. They believe in fair play and justice. The case for political change, the convention's proposals and the fact that Labour will implement a Scottish Parliament will get massive support in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the right hon. Member for Ayr that the constitutional issue is important and that it is high on the political agenda, but I have held five surgeries this month and seen more than 50 people, and not one of them has said that a Scottish Parliament is at the top of the agenda. For the people in my constituency, getting rid of the Government is at the top of the agenda. That is the priority if there is to be any chance for the people of Scotland. Perhaps that explains why there has been a polarisation in Scottish politics, which has been encouraged by the Government and exploited by the Scottish National party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the 50 seats in Scotland that Labour took in the 1987 general election, the Conservatives were the runners-up in 34 and the SNP was last in 31. If we consider the Conservative seats in Ayr, Stirling, Edinburgh, Pentlands and Dumfries, it is clear that the Government's interest would be best served by a weakening of the Labour vote to the advantage of the SNP. That would return the Conservatives to Westminster, possibly with more seats, as they hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we want a Scottish Parliament, we need a Labour Government. That is what the election will be about. The only way that we can give the people of Scotland a respite from 13 years of misery under a Tory Government is to elect a Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.52 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The remarks of the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing) about my right hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) should be reciprocated in respect of his own career in the House of Commons. The hon. Gentleman was one of the best Members of Parliament on the Opposition Benches. He and I frequently debated subjects when we were on opposite Front Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing reform, and it is important to remember that reform is not always successful. The case must be proved beyond doubt before we go down a difficult road into another form of constitution. It is up to us as Members of Parliament to ensure that the Scottish people have the best quality of life. There are now 100,000 fewer unemployed than there were four years ago in Scotland, but I know that the unemployment figure is still far too high. We are desperately keen to reduce it, and we are doing so through the Government's policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our duty is to ensure that the people of Scotland have good jobs, a good environment, and good housing, health, education and defence. Defence and keeping the peace is the first job of any Government. The comments of the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) on the defence of the realm were disgraceful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
The convention proposals are almost the Labour party's Assembly plans, disguised in an attempt to carry the Liberal Democrats with them by promises of proportional representation, whether through the single transferable vote, the additional member system or another system. It is surprising to see Labour abandoning its long-held principle of "first past the post" in order to retain the Liberal Democrats' support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be a major change—an Assembly or, worse still, independence—we Scottish Members of Parliament could recommend it only on two conditions. First, there would have to be a guarantee that it would be better in every way for the Scottish people. Secondly, it would have to be completed and show a positive dividend within a reasonable time scale. The proposals before us fail on both counts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not there one other criterion that the hon. Gentleman has not taken into account—whether the Scottish people want such a change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is always so impatient. He never lets any Member of Parliament on either side of the House develop an argument, without leaping to his feet and intervening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All members of the Committee know the time that it takes for legislation to pass through the House of Commons. It would certainly take a year to get the proposed legislation through and another year to set up the electoral machinery and elect an Assembly. The analogy of local government in the 1970s shows how long it takes to get the procedure running smoothly and showing an effective advantage over the previous system. It might be five years or more before an Assembly produced the results that so many honourable men seem to think could be achieved overnight. They are woefully optimistic if they believe that they could see positive results from an Assembly in less than five years. During that period industry and commerce would lack confidence about the future. It is important to bear that in mind before we decide whether to make any change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Scotland should have a major say in the constitutional future of our country. They must understand all aspects of the policies of each party so that they can make a fair judgment. As we know from our study of the press, it is extremely difficult to get from the newspapers a fair account of the detailed proposals of each party. Much significance has been attached to a recent public opinion poll showing that 50 per cent. of Scots might vote for independence. In a future poll that figure will, I believe, be substantially reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood) that when we examine polls showing the order of importance of the issues that most worry electors, we find that constitutional reform is low down the league table—perhaps seventh or eighth. It is possible to overestimate the intensity of interest in constitutional reform in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote from a leader in a national newspaper on 10 February. It states that the newspaper
	<br><blockquote><p>"is proud of its reputation for unbiased reporting. In the current political climate it is more important than ever. We intend to maintain it".</p></blockquote>
That was the view of 
	<i>The Scotsman,</i> yet it is difficult to get the media to give fair coverage to all aspects of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
constitutional debate. For example, the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) tabled an important Bill that was debated in the House of Commons on 7 February. It was the first time that the House had had an opportunity to debate home rule since interest in the subject had increased over the past six months or so. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) spoke in the debate, as did the hon. and learned Gentleman. However, not one scrap of the debate appeared in 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> the following day. One would not have known that it had taken place—perhaps that was because my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State took everyone to the cleaners. It is sad that when we have a Scottish debate in Westminster, a leading newspaper—so it claims—does not report it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recollect that not one Scottish National Member was present to take part in the debate, yet SNP claims that it is interested in everything Scottish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do recollect that and I commend the hon. Gentleman for being present and participating by intervention. It was truly disgraceful that, not for the first time, SNP Members failed to turn up for a Scottish debate in the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The headline on the front page of 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> is entirely incorrect and, what is more worrying, there are only two short quotations from the Prime Minister's speech last Saturday. If that is the treatment that the most senior member of the Government obtains from the press, one can appreciate how difficult it is for hon. Members from all sides. I should like the leaders of the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats to be given equal space to put their cases so that the people of Scotland are well aware of what they are voting for in the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be given straighter answers from the Labour party than we have received. I presume that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) does not know those answers. I refer to the East Lothian case. Which members of Parliament will be able to vote for what, and what point of view can they represent as Ministers? We have listened to accounts of the situation in Livingston, Monklands and Dunfermline, so we need clear answers because they are important to the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also want to know about regional assemblies. Will it be the policy of a Labour Government to establish them? Are we to adopt a federal system? If so, it will become a different ball game. We need to know the answers to our questions but, so far, all we have heard from Labour Members is that those problems will be sorted out later. Before they cast their votes, the people of Scotland have a right to know the details of the Labour party's policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position of the Secretary of State for Scotland is becoming increasingly blurred. Under whatever system we have, I should have thought that it was crucial to have a Secretary of State for Scotland who is a power in the Cabinet. Yet we hear that that might not be so and the speeches of Labour Members seem to imply that the Secretary of State is not all that important. Successive Secretaries of State such as the late Lord Ross of Marnock, my right hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang) have all done excellent work in the Cabinet in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
representing Scotland. We want to know whether our case will be put in the Westminster Government if there is a Scottish Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what the answers are because we have had insufficient discussion of the matter, but what will happen if there is conflict between an Assembly in Scotland with a socialist majority and a Westminster Parliament with a Conservative majority? Inevitably, there will be tremendous conflict and a failure of good government throughout the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has tended to underestimate the changes in Governments of both parties in the past 20 or 30 years. More and more administrative powers have been devolved to the Scottish Office and to local authorities. Many more matters are decided in Scotland today than 20, 30 or 40 years ago when those decisions were far more centralised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate must also consider the issue of local government. The general consensus seems to be that we might be moving to a single-tier form of local government which may take one, two or three years to achieve. We must be more flexible than merely talking about single-tier local government because some regions will be remote from electors in villages and small communities. With districts, there will be an enormous number of joint committees, virtually passing responsibility back to regional level for education, social work and the police and fire services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is obviously concerned about the present form of local government but, as he knows its history, he will understand that it was imposed on Scotland by his colleagues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman uses the word "imposed" in a rather strange way. If he had been present in the Scottish Standing Committee that dealt with the matter he would know that it went through it inch-by-inch and page-by-page. The main theme was produced by Lord Wheatley and much of it was agreed. The hon. Gentleman's Government continued with that policy when it came to power in 1974, so I do not think that he can point a finger and say that the present system was proposed solely by a Conservative Government. It stemmed from a royal commission which included Lord Wheatley who, I suspect, might even have joined the hon. Gentleman in the same Lobby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate is bound by a tight time scale, but we must not overlook the issue of industry. How is Scotland to deal with VAT, interest rates, income tax, corporation tax and so on? We have proved that it will cost the Scottish people a great deal more if they have the system that is proposed. I believe that there has been much misrepresentation of the position of Scottish industry. We know about the Scottish financial enterprises, but what came out of the CBI was a fence-sitting operation that fell flat. I suspect that a great many rude letters will be sent by industry in Scotland to the CBI this week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not let the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) off the hook. He has disappeared, having taken little part in the debate apart from making his speech. He should come back to listen to what other hon. Members have to say. If he believes that we accept the SNP defence policy, he is living in cloud cuckoo land. How can his independent Scotland maintain Kinloss, Lossiemouth, Leuchars, Rosyth, the Clyde yards and so on and expect to pay for that without vast resources, which it lacks? Would orders have been placed with Yarrow if there had been an
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
independent Scotland? The hon. Gentleman also made shameful comments about retaining Scottish regiments, which I doubt he could prove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key point is the strength of the Union and, with my colleagues, I believe that if we started down the road to a Scottish Parliament it would not be long before we moved to independence because of the conflict of interest. We must not start down that road. We have a fine Union that has worked extremely well for many hundreds of years and there is every prospect of its continuing. We must show the Scottish people that our economic policies will improve their quality of life and that they should be allowed to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>1.9 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate is long overdue. It is interesting to recall that, not long ago, the Secretary of State for Scotland and other Ministers were telling us that the Scottish constitutional question was a non-issue and that people of Scotland were not interested in it. Times have certainly changed. The Prime Minister belatedly made a flying visit to Scotland in a desperate attempt to defend a status quo which even the Scottish CBI tells us is no longer tenable. All that the Prime Minister can say in response is that he will take stock of public opinion as expressed in the forthcoming general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister is at least 10 years too late. The real question facing the people of Scotland is not whether we want a Scottish Parliament, but when one will be established and how it will be established. Election after election and opinion poll after opinion poll have demonstrated that an overwhelming majority of the people in Scotland want a Scottish Parliament with legislative and economic powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How shall we deliver a Scottish Parliament? If we are to bring about such a radical constitutional change, it is only common sense to have the broad consensus of the Scottish people behind it. The Scottish Constitutional Convention has such a strength—its representation includes more than 80 per cent. of Scottish Members of Parliament and MEPs; more than 90 per cent. of Scottish local authorities; churches of various denominations; the Scottish trade union movement; and, despite what Ministers say, a useful input has been made to the convention by people experienced in Scottish business and commerce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is naive to imagine that we could deliver Scottish constitutional change of the nature that we seek without such broad support. I suspect that even the Government realise that, which is why they are trying to rubbish the SCC and trying to squeeze it out by polarising the debate between status quo and independence. If, by adopting such a strategy, the Government's aim is to save their own skins and to save the Union, they are playing with fire. The whole issue could backfire on them. They could risk the annihilation of their party, the Scottish Conservative and Unionist party, and that of the Union, which they claim to defend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never argued that independence should not be considered as an option. If the Government ever offered me a choice between the status quo or independence, I would opt for independence. I would not be alone in so doing. Faced with such a decision, I believe that the majority of Scottish people would agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never argued that an independent Scotland could not be viable. The people of Scotland—indeed, the people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
of any nation—are entitled to as much self-determination as they want. However, independence is not the only option: the home rule proposals of the Scottish Constitutional Convention are far more capable of achieving maximum unity and of delivering a Scottish Parliament in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be foolhardy for any political party to attempt to go it alone. I am sure that those realists within the Scottish National party do not believe, deep within their heart of hearts, that they will achieve a successful outcome at the forthcoming general election—that is, that they will win 37 seats out of the 72 seats. They do not really think that they will march victoriously along Princes street, occupy St. Andrew's house, remove the Union Jack and replace it with the saltire—and, hey presto, we shall all be free in 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Life is more complex than that. I am sure that the realists within the Scottish National party know that, too. I am not making or expecting them—nobody is—to surrender their commitment to independence. However, I am urging them to face up to the realities of the position in which we find ourselves and to realise that what unites the people of Scotland on this issue is more important than what divides us. I ask them not to fall into the Tory trap of being divided and ruled by the Conservative party. Let us learn the lessons of the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland is at the crossroads: it is facing an important general election on constitutional and other issues. The people of Scotland will soon be provided with a great opportunity. It would be tragic if that opportunity were lost because certain politicians, who claim to support a Scottish Parliament, decide for their selfish reasons or for those of their party that they would be better going it alone. They would be attempting to divide the people of Scotland when what we want is maximum unity. The convention's proposals, imperfect though they may be, are the best option available for uniting the Scottish people and for gaining maximum support for a Scottish Parliament. With the Labour victory at the forthcoming general election, the proposals will be turned into reality. I say to all members of the Committee who believe, in principle, in a Scottish Parliament that the convention proposals are worthy of our support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I often complain that the male domination of politics means much macho posturing but, in fairness to the Secretary of State, what he said this morning had more in common with Ebenezer Scrooge that with Arnold Schwarzenegger. However, members of the Scottish National party displayed more macho posturing today than they have for years. Men have often told me that they can be made to feel like wimps because they have not supported wholeheartedly the ideas that members of the SNP say are good for Scotland. They have said they are made to feel inadequate if they have other ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a public meeting that I attended in Maryhill the other night, the Scottish National party candidate compared Scotland with a bantustan. This morning mention was made of Sudeten Scots, but to describe Scotland as being equivalent to a bantustan simply displays an incredible ignorance of the real conditions

suffered by people who live under that system. That was a disgrace coming from anyone who professes to be an internationalist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) thought that he had made an effective point when he referred to Labour's A team and how not all its members would join the Scottish Parliament. He seemed to forget that, in every party, there is a women's team. Women have not managed to become Members of Parliament in great numbers, but at least the convention contains proposals to ensure that, if our plans are carried forward, women will take their rightful place. The Scottish National party has a woman parliamentary leader, and it is especially interesting that she has not been asked to speak on behalf of the SNP today. Instead, it is the more loud-voiced aspect of the SNP that is coming across; she is often left with the dross in such debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating the merits of the status quo, separation and the convention's proposals for a Scottish Parliament, and it is time that we debated what is on offer for the women of Scotland. I hope that today we will start that debate and that the Tories and the nationalists will be persuaded to reveal their views about matters on which they have so far been silent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The convention's proposals are fairly well-known by now and are ready to be put into action immediately after a Labour Government are elected to carry forward our plans for creating a Scottish Parliament. All the members of the convention agreed long ago that a Scottish Parliament would work normal day-time hours to a parliamentary calendar that matches the school holidays in Scotland. They agreed that childcare would be provided for elected Members and staff, and that help would be given for the care of other dependants. They agreed that Members would be full time and should not treat the great honour of being elected to the first Scottish Parliament for 300 years as a part-time interest in the time left over from more lucrative business pursuits, which is how many hon. Members treat their work at Westminster. It would be a full-time job and they would be paid a fair rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those steps are necessary to ensure the highest possible participation by people whose responsibilities often preclude them from playing a more active role in their country's decision making. That exclusion is not only unfair to them individually; it silences the voices of those who need to be heard. The convention has unanimously agreed to those common-sense steps at the outset, while Westminster continues to deny us childcare facilities and to work hours that make family life impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The choice is simple: open and accessible, or not; for all our people, or not. In the convention we have established a vital principle—no one should feel that a Scottish Parliament excludes them. We know that the Tories think that we have the best in the best of all status quo worlds. They are beginning to realise that a strain is being put on the Union, but they do not even listen to Tory women who tell them that an all-male Cabinet is not representative. As for the nationalists, we do not know what they think about these matters; they never utter a word about them. Perhaps today they will begin to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The convention has agreed that steps need to be taken to ensure equality of representation for women. The reason is obvious. Just look around us—four women out of 72 is the highest proportion of women elected Members in Scotland that we have ever had. There have only ever been 21 women representing Scottish seats from all the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
parties put together. We can either leave the matter to chance and end up with a Scottish Parliament with much the same composition as the Westminster Parliament, or we can seize this unique opportunity at the start to ensure equality of representation in a Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By now I am wearily familiar with the arguments against that proposal—that is, when opponents find the energy or the courage to argue. I have been asked whether there are enough women of appropriate calibre. I have not noticed any system of quality control over the years. Only a few weeks ago, 
	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> offered the opinion that the Scottish Office was filled by men who would be more appropriately employed as bottle-washers. I am convinced that many a low-paid bottle-washer—male or female—could do a better job than that lot in the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been told that this is too big a step to take; it is too bold an advance. Let us ask the Scottish people and find out. Such timidity is not surprising, coming from adherents of the status quo, but it is strange coming from people who have the courage to propose dramatic changes in the way in which Scotland is ruled—even the break up of the United Kingdom. If they expound such radicalism, why go that far and no farther? Where do the nationalists stand on that issue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the problem is not so inexplicable because it is rife throughout politics. In 1990, the Hansard Society put politics alongside academic life and the law as the territories that were the toughest for women to enter. Politics is seen as a man's game—which is all it is to some overgrown schoolboys at Westminster. It is not a game; it is a deadly serious business and it is high time that women had a fair share in making the decisions that affect our lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Labour Government will ensure that we have a Scottish Parliament with a Minister for women who liaises with other Ministers to ensure that policies are devised and implemented with women's needs taken into consideration. A Labour Government will introduce a statutory minimum wage and a sex equality Act. They will extend maternity pay to all working women and the right to return to work. We have a strong commitment to nursery education and to childcare provision. We know the Tories' attitude to those issues. Far from improving the lot of working women, they have in many ways created the problems that Labour will have to put right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do the Tories see the future for women in Scotland under the status quo? The abolition of wages councils is easily foreseen, as well as cuts in health care standards and longer waiting lists for operations. There will be less chance of a second bite at training and education for women who have taken time out to rear their families. We can certainly foresee more children with asthma and bronchitis because the walls of their homes are running with damp. Perhaps the Scottish Nationalist party will break its self-imposed and uncharacteristic silence. I notice that Fiona Hyslop has recently become its Chief Security to the Treasury in waiting, following criticism that when the leader of the Scottish National party formed his Cabinet in waiting he managed to find only two women—he could hardly have left them out considering their position in politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the nationalists' policies on the minimum wage, on equal pay for work of equal value and on maternity pay? If they agree with such policies—I am sure that they do because they are always so keen to present
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
their socialist credentials, at least in the west of Scotland—have they told Scottish capitalists and the Scottish restaurant and hotelkeepers who pay their work force low wages? Those people have got their share and they will be interested to know whether they can keep it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Or is it one message for Govan and Garscadden and another for Banff and Buchan? Will the nationalists tell 
	<i>The Sun</i> that it is not appropriate for a newspaper that supports a radical party to demean women? If they did, would 
	<i>The Sun</i> take a blind bit of notice? No. 
	<i>The Sun</i> has discovered that it sells far more newspapers in Scotland with its new nationalist packaging, but the basic product remains the same. Every trade unionist I know is aware of 
	<i>The Sun's</i> record and wonders how a party can present itself with any credibility as being of the left when it has allowed itself to be connected with such a newspaper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have posed just a few of the more crucial questions that women would like to ask the nationalists and the Tories. I should like to have ranged more widely. As chair of the Scottish group I feel a duty to do so, but I also have a duty to use my time on behalf of the women of Scotland whose questions are ignored by the other parties that want to gain their support. It is high time that those parties told us where they stand on these issues. Perhaps we shall get some answers today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know the answer to one question. Women are supporting Labour. The latest poll of women voters put Labour six points ahead in the United Kingdom. They are not beguiled by Major's smile or by the Salmond smirk. They will vote Labour and get a Government who listen to women and include women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure for me to contribute to the debate because, like other Opposition Members who have spoken, I believe that the Government have conducted the politics of fear with respect to the convention. They are not unlike Tory Central Office when it talks about Labour's tax bombshells and distributes lies. It is the same when Tories talk about police constables having to pay £446 more. The Government have failed to deal with the democratic deficit that has existed in this country for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The leader in 
	<i>The Times</i> of 20 January 1992 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"How long can the Tories keep up their opposition to constitutional change in Scotland in the face of overwhelming support for greater self-government? Conservative scare-mongering over devolution has always been patronising. It is now reckless … The government's policy of centralism is anachronistic and prejudicial to the Union."</p></blockquote>
We are having this debate because the Government's policy is prejudicial to the Union. Scotland has made its voice heard for many years: we want self-government. In the past 13 years we have witnessed an increasing trend towards centralisation at Westminster with a weakening of the power of local authorities. There is a vacuum and only representation at Westminster can fill it at the moment, but that is inadequate. That message has gone out from Scotland for many years. Parliament's control over Government is weak and there is a lack of scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had experience of that when I was elected in 1987 and put on the Committee that considered the poll tax Bill—150 hours of futile attendance. What did we get?—an Act that was unworkable and prejudicial to the interests of the people of this country. Hon. Members know how unworkable it is because people come to them to explain their difficulties with it.

	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
The issue of Scottish Question Time has been mentioned. Last week my district general hospital had to close its doors to emergency admissions, including some heart attack victims, and send such patients to Glasgow because it did not have enough money or beds. I had hoped to draw attention to that disgraceful occurrence by raising it during Scottish questions on Wednesday. I have looked at the proposed questions for Wednesday and there is only one that relates to health in Lothian. My question will have to go by the board and the interests of my constituents will not be served. The fact that the hospital in my constituency is not admitting emergency patients will not be dealt with. That is disgraceful. We have witnessed such things year after year at Westminster. We do not complain about English Members of Parliament intervening during Scottish questions because we believe they should not do so—after all, it is a unitary Parliament—but because we have insufficient means to get our complaints across and deal with issues that affect our constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Constitutional Convention should be congratulated for recognising the democratic deficit. Scotland leads the United Kingdom in the constitutional debate—a debate about interdependence, not independence. There is a question mark over the effectiveness of the nation state. Pressures are building up in the international market and from the Pacific rim and Japan. No state can exist on its own against that. Nation states are often too big to give adequate expression to the different cultural aspirations and to cater for diverse economic needs. That is the issue in Scotland and that is why we need devolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nationalists want independence in Europe; that is separatism, then negotiation. That is what independence in Europe means. They are being not only mischievous but they are misleading the Scottish people by using the words "independence in Europe". Their policy is one of separatism followed by negotiation and then, perhaps, independence or interdependence within Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) had a good run to express his views this morning, as always, unlike those of us who have to struggle. He said that his views on independence were based on economic calculations, not sentiment. Professor Bill Miller, in an article in 
	<i>The Guardian</i> at the beginning of February, shows that mainstream separatist thought does not countenance the notion that individuals in Scotland would be significantly and immediately better off as a result of independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talks of Scotland's oil—90 per cent. of North sea reserves are Scottish. The Scottish pound—let us call it the ecosse—would be a petrocurrency. The hon. Gentleman argues that Scotland would establish its own currency within the discipline of the bands of the exchange rate mechanism and maintain a stable rate of exchange because it would be largely ignored by currency speculators. Someone who believes that would believe anything. That scenario stretches credibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan must say what the sterling exchange rate will be. Will he use independence to devalue the currency and boost Scottish output and productivity at a stroke? The ecosse, even more than sterling, would be a petrocurrency subject to intense speculation. Earlier I mentioned Sweden, which had to
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
raise interest rates by 6 per cent. in November to defend its currency. If the ecosse is not speculation-proof, the whole panoply of exchange rate mechanisms, central banking and the establishment of reserves must be considered. How long will Scotland take to gain credibility in Europe? France has been in the ERM for 12 years and still lacks credibility compared with Germany. Scotland would take an awful lot longer to gain it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an article in the 
	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan wrote that Scotland exports more per head than Japan. However, it is impossible to collect such figures accurately. It is impossible to discover the details of Scottish exports to Blackpool, never mind Japan. Many countries, such as Mexico and Venezuela, have high exports per head figures but that proves nothing. We must consider the import side of the equation. If the population of England was considered, the exports per head figure would still be comparable with Japan's. That proves nothing about the United Kingdom economy compared with the Japanese economy. The specious arguments of the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan must be examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the role at the top table of the European Community? It is debatable whether Scotland would achieve more with three votes than does the United Kingdom with 10. The Haensch proposals, which are being considered, would re-organise EC institutions so that smaller members would be deprived of the right to chair the Council of Ministers and the automatic right to representation on the Commission. Maastricht was about political depth, and the summit in Edinburgh in December will be about width and how to accomplish it. Small nation states will lose out and an independent Scotland would gain no benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SNP offers separation plus negotiation., The convention offers interdependence and understands the benefits of a Europe of the regions. It recognises that the momentum for a Europe of the regions comes from member states that already have federal or devolved systems of government, be they German Länder or Spanish autonomous provinces. The Europe of the regions is bypassing existing member states. Economic and political power ultimately will be redistributed to those regions under the Brussels principle of subsidiarity. I look forward to the day when Scottish business, whether it be health or education, can be examined properly in this building by a Committee structure that has pre-legislative powers to consider business and ensure decent legislation for the Scottish people. We need not only a Scottish European office but a Scottish Minister for European Affairs to represent Scotland at the highest level. That would reverse the democratic deficit. There is enthusiasm for closer union with Europe and decentralised decision-making. We are on that tide. It is not contradictary; it is a complementary impulse. We will be part of a European-wide move to a triadic system of power with a balance between Brussels, Westminster and Scotland. That is the way forward and I commend the convention's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Conservative party is not interested in adopting a position in the debate for short-term opportunism or narrow partisan gain. The constitution is too important to be played with in that way. My attitudes are conditioned by the realities of getting fundamental constitutional change through Parliament. We have a duty to our constituents to address that. Anyone who pretends that it is easy has not taken part in the many constitutional matters that involve us, particularly the changes regarding Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now consider the structures and powers of the Scottish Constitutional Convention's proposals. Those matters must be examined in depth by Parliament because we have not heard the answer to the problem of macro-economics. In a nutshell—I agree with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) on this—the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the unitary Parliament must control the macro-economics of the whole United Kingdom. Therefore, the borrowing that will be required by the SCC's proposals would, properly, be kept strictly in check by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He is liable to do to the convention's Assembly what he did to local government between 1974 and 1979; to massively reduce its ability to borrow and spend. I believe that it is honourable to speak out in favour of the union, to speak out for the benefits of the unitary Parliament and to draw attention to the constitutional hazards of unilateral devolution. I want to separate unilateral devolution from anything that is agreed with the United Kingdom because, if we want to bring about constitutional change, that change must be acceptable to every part of the United Kingdom if it is to succeed. It is fairly clear that the convention's unilateral devolution proposals would have considerable difficulty getting through Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is more likely to lose his seat than I am. At least I say the same outside and inside Parliament. Whatever my failings, I am consistent. Constitutional change—I am dealing with fundamentals, not details—to the United Kingdom must be acceptable to all the United Kingdom. Scotland makes up less than 9 per cent. of the population of the United Kingdom. Therefore, it must present a case that can be successfully carried through Parliament. That is my starting point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention to the fact that in this building today are three Members of Parliament from my home town of Dundee—two from the Labour party and myself—all of us from humble origins. That shows that, under the present system of a unitary Parliament, there is no bar to people of all socio-economic groups coming forward and representing various views. That is important. The unitary Parliament is open to all who wish to get there. As the Conservative party is the party of the Union, we could not support proposals that we believe to be unworkable and which are not likely to get through Parliament. That is why I described the SCC's proposals as flawed and fraudulent. They are flawed because they are unworkable and they are fraudulent because many people who support them know that they are unworkable. That is fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not had an answer to the financial questions, which are fundamental. Anyone who imagines that we can set up any sort of body, which will concentrate media attention on it, particularly when it is in disagreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is not addressing the real issue of the instability that would be caused.

We must not pretend to the Scottish people that we can provide unilateral devolution without constitutional flaws and problems. The real problem is the failure to address that and to provide clear answers about how the proposals can be made to work.

Having taken part in the debate in the House when the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) put forward his proposals, it is clear that the Liberal Democrats see this and their proposals as the first step towards a federal structure.

The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan did not give way to me because he was speaking about defence. His statement about defence was more fraudulent than anything I have heard for a long time. How can the hon. Gentleman tell the people of Scotland that, under the Labour party's separatist proposals, Leuchars Tornados, Kinloss Nimrods and Lossiemouth Tornados would remain? There is no chance of that happening. Three major bases would close. They are Coulport, Faslane and Rosyth—how could a naval dockyard be maintained there? The Labour party should tell it to the marines—to the marine base at Condor, in Arbroath—the 45 commando—because they will have no future in a separatist Scotland. What about RAF Buchan, RAF Edzell, Prestwick and Saxavord? What about Almondbank in my constituency, which repairs helicopter parts? There would be no future for it because it undertakes work for all the aircraft of the United Kingdom.

Yarrows would get no orders for frigates, GEC Ferranti would have no future for its avionics, which are among the best in the world.

The plain truth is that tens of thousands of jobs would be at risk because of the separatist, socialist proposals. The separatist, socialist nationalists tell us that they have no aspirations to govern Scotland. They have set up a shadow Cabinet, with a shadow Prime Minister and a shadow Chancellor, and they plan to establish embassies, but they have no aspirations of power.

I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) for her eloquent contribution on behalf of women. She was right to say that only four of the 72 Scottish Members of Parliament are women. It is interesting that all four of those women are present, as they are at every debate relating to Scotland. The hon. Lady pointed out how difficult it is for women to get involved in politics—they have to overcome higher hurdles than men in getting elected. Once they are elected, they are in such a minority that it is often difficult for them to be called to speak. Therefore, Mr. Martin, I thank you for calling me so soon after my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are we here today? Is it because the Government have suddenly realised that a Scottish question exists or because the Government have lost yet another Scottish seat, in Kincardine and Deeside? Have they been dragged here kicking and screaming to tell us that the people of Scotland want to preserve the status quo, when we all know that that is not the case now and has not been in the past? When the Scottish people are given the opportunity to decide for themselves, we will know what they want. Until we have a system of proportionality, whereby the views of all the Scottish people are represented, we cannot know what they want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals of the Scottish Constitutional Convention set out a base for that proportionality. No one is saying that proportionality is a panacea for all ills. It is not. It is for the Scottish people to decide, after the Parliament is set up with some proportionality, whether they want to go down the road of independence. It is not something for 72 hon. Members, who are elected by a minority of the Scottish people, to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the Scottish National party did not join the convention because it could have had its views on independence taken into account. The Tories were also asked to join, but they have continually refused to participate in the debate. That is hardly surprising. No Government ever surrenders territory without some reluctance. Similarly, Governments rarely give up their independence without reluctance—yet that happened here in Edinburgh 300 years ago, when Scottish independence was handed over quite peaceably. That was probably the greatest event of Scottish history and has been no small contribution to English development.

The SCC has laid down the basis for a forum in which the Scottish people can decide their future. There is no doubt that the Scottish people want that base. They want

not all-out independence, but to govern their own home affairs in a Scottish Parliament, locked into a Westminster Parliament that governs affairs common to all our neighbours. One does not dig up the pavement of the people next door because one does not want to live in their house. We recognise that we have common affairs with England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Scottish Parliament will be a catalyst for radical change for the rest of Britain, for the good of everyone. The West Lothian question can be answered in that way. It would be a question not for the people of Scotland, but for the people of England. They would have to decide whether they want federalism. No one disagrees about that. The issue is ultimately about a democracy that flows from the people to the Government, rather than being visited on the people by the Government. It will be for the rest of the islands to decide whether they wish to come into the federal system and set up regional Parliaments in England and Wales that will organise their own home affairs, and feed into a Westminster Parliament that rules over the common affairs of all those people and that in turn feeds into Europe. That is democracy and if the Tories do not like the price of that democracy, that is just too bad. The people of the United Kingdom will decide whether they want that Parliament, what it will cost, what they are prepared to pay for it and the level of taxes.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, North (Mr. Adams) has referred to the west Lothian question. Every time I hear someone talk about it I feel like posing the east Lothian question: why is it that people whom I represent have had to put up for so long with a minority Government whom they did not elect? Why does the Lothian health board, to which the Minister of State nominated all his clones, run my constituents' health service? Why has the budget of the Lothian regional council been set by central Government year after year? All that is Scotland's democratic deficit, which Parliament must address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exactly 13 years ago this week Scotland voted by a majority of 77,000 for the establishment of a Scottish Parliament. That was not as big a majority as we should have liked. However, we must bear in mind that many people voted "no" because they were assured by no less a person than Lord Home, about whom we have already heard, that they would receive something better from an in-coming Conservative Government. It has been a little difficult to pin down that better thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first thrilling step that that Government took was to say that the Scottish Grand Committee could sit in Edinburgh. Well, that is not devolution of power or democratic accountability. Then they set up the Scottish Affairs Select Committee, which survived one and a bit Parliaments, until the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said that he could not be bothered to serve on it. That is why the Scottish Office is one of only two Departments of State in the United Kingdom that are not monitored by a Select Committee. So much for the better accountability that was to be ushered in by a Conservative Government. The Scotland Act 1978 was repealed in spite of that undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
What have we had ever since? We have had 13 years of bad, grossly unaccountable Government, which has lasted from the closure of Linwood and Invergordon to the impending closure of Ravenscraig. We have seen the emasculation of local government, and interference in our health service and education system by no less a person than the Minister of State, whose mandate, such as it is, comes from the people of Stirling. All that has been inflicted on the people in Scotland under the authority of a party that can muster only nine out of Scotland's 72 Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a powerful case for Scottish home rule in 1979. In 1992, there is a historical imperative: we must have home rule in Scotland. It is time that the whole of the United Kingdom's Parliament acknowledged that fact. The case for home rule has been underscored time and again by the intolerable abuse of power in Scotland by this minority regime. The Government are also guilty of something far worse: they have brought the entire democratic process in Britain into disrepute and undermined the credibility of our institutions of government. Time and again people in Scotland say what is the point of voting because, whoever they vote for, they end up with a Conservative Government who hand out that kind of medicine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We keep hearing that 50 per cent. of the people who responded to a particular opinion poll said that they were in favour of independence. Frankly, if someone offered me a choice between the status quo and independence, I would opt for independence. It must be better than the status quo. If one asks a silly question, one gets a silly answer. There are other ways of improving the structure of Government in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that it is in the interests of both the Conservative and the Scottish National parties to try to polarise the argument to force people to vote for the status quo or independence, but that is an irresponsible, reckless approach to the debate on the future of Scotland and the United Kingdom. I have no doubt that people want to reject the discredited Conservative party, but I am equally confident that they will reject the nonsense that has been put before them by the Scottish National party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) mentioned defence policy. I have done some work on that issue in my capacity as a member of the Select Committee on Defence and I am interested in the likely consequences of the Scottish National party's policy. How on earth will it save all the Scottish regiments and what role will they have if Scotland comes out of NATO? Does the SNP want to bring in conscription to save the Gordon Highlanders and all the other regiments? That is the only way in which it could do so. Perhaps the Scottish National Members would like to respond to that. I have no doubt that that proposal will be rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a choice—not the dotty choice between the status quo and independence, but another way of radically revising the constitution of the United Kingdom and ensuring that there is democratic accountability of all the power that has been devolved to the Scottish Office. I am fed up with hearing Conservative Members talk about another tier of Government. That tier already exists in the form of 7,000 civil servants in the Scottish Office. Power is already devolved to the Scottish Office and we want democratic control over it.

Convention; it has been debated over many years. The convention has done excellent work and we should support its conclusions. My predecessor, John Mackintosh, published in 1975 a pamphlet called "A Parliament for Scotland" that made the case for home rule for Scotland within the United Kingdom. That made sense and it is now imperative that we go down that road. That is the way forward for Scotland and the United Kingdom and it is the alternative for the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate is about Scotland's status. Do we, as a nation, wish to remain a region within the United Kingdom and to be neglected within the context of Europe, or do we want to regain national status and again play our role as part of that growing Europe? It is up to the Scottish people, not the Committee, to decide whether Scotland's future lies with regionalism or among the nations of Europe and the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Independence within Europe is a crystal clear choice. More and more Scots are deciding that that is the way that their country should go. The status quo is simply untenable. The sight of the Prime Minister coming to Scotland for 95 minutes and praying in aid the British empire as a reason why Scotland should not regain control of its own affairs is simply pathetic. While due honour should be given to past achievements, our duty is to look to Scotland's future, which must be in a wider, expanding Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sovereignty is not a problem for Scotland. In the past, we have pooled our sovereignty in a common market with England. We now want to hold that sovereignty in our own right in the wider, expanding and 300-million-strong market of Europe. While England agonises over lost, past glories, we must realistically secure Scotland's future among that European-wide prosperity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate exemplifies how irrelevant and sterile the Westminster system has become for Scotland. Today, the Tory party has absolutely nothing positive to say for Scotland. At no time in the debate did Tory Members say anything positive for our country. They offered no vision, no ideas and no change. The London system is merely throwing the gift of a one-day debate as a sop to the Scottish people who are restless and on the move politically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crystal clear that we, the Scottish people, will now get that for which we vote. The power to change is in our hands in a way that it has never been before. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I hear the moans and groans from the 1987, sterile Parliament, which is out of date and which will answer to the electorate who are clearly telling the Government the way to Scotland's future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Grand Committee is a sign of Scotland's current status. I am glad that it is being televised. The subject was chosen by the Government. The debate is being held in a converted school hall and there will be no actual vote at the end of it. All the Members of Parliament will pile on to trains and planes and go back to London for business as usual. That means no power, no decisions and no action for Scotland. So long as we are stuck with regional devolution or the status quo, Scotland will continue to be reduced to that level. That is not good enough any more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
To keep Scotland in its current subservient state—we have had plenty of examples of that this morning—the Tories have had to reduce Scotland's perspective of the world and our national expectations to a minimum. Hence the propaganda today about subsidies and other unsubstantiated Tory scares about lost jobs. That no longer washes with the Scottish electorate because it has seen through it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To shoehorn Scotland's status, needs and democratically expressed wishes into devolution, the Labour and Liberal regionalists have continually had to downgrade Scotland and compare it with European regions rather than nations. Their approach will allow only minimal powers for a Scottish Assembly that will ultimately be controlled by Westminster. By setting such bounds and fetters on Scottish control over decision making, devolution will simply continue the system of decisions at second hand and under the control of others. Devolution is partial self-government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We should be in Europe in our own right, like Denmark, tiny Luxembourg, Ireland and Germany. Only first-class status with a voice and a vote will be good enough for Scotland. I leave that decision in the hands of the Scottish electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The devolution that is proposed by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) and his pals in the Labour party is partial self-government, partial benefit and a partial solution. It is short-termism, but with a long-term recipe for arguments, disappointment and confusion in our national decision-making. It is an attempt to provide a regional solution to a national problem. The Scottish Assembly proposal is fatally flawed because it is designed to suit the status quo and to ensure that Scotland will not be in control of its own destiny. It is self-government by instalment; a sticky, messy compromise that will lead to endless conflict and frustration. Scots will seek the freedom of national and international action and will continue to reach for the ultimate goal of independence, because that alone will meet our needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not need a pocket-money Parliament whereby Scotland continues to send all its resources and revenues to the Westminster Exchequer to have handed back a smaller portion and told that that is its lot. If the London Government accept such an Assembly, and are happy to rate-cap the Lothian region, think what they would do to a Scottish Assembly to which they sent pocket money annually. That is out of date and will not suffice for Scotland. A pocket-money Parliament will not do. Scotland must have positive control over Scottish resources and participation in a developing, growing and ever-changing Europe. We want to be in Europe in our own right and be part of that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to say that the debate on the whole question of Scotland's future is people-led. It has nothing to do with today's debate. It is being led and determined by the Scottish people and it will proceed at the pace that they

determine through the ballot box. It is pressure from Scottish voters that has put Scotland on to the political agenda. We now know how to get things done for Scotland. The choice is clear—to be a mere region or to be a nation again, participating fully in our own right in a growing and developing Europe. The logic of independence in Europe shows clearly where Scotland's future rests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the proposals of the convention were truly self-government by instalments, the Scottish Nationalists would support it. It would be one more step along the road to independence. The SNP do not support it because they know it will not be one more step. The Scottish people, once they get what they truly want—what they indicate in every poll that they truly want—will be satisfied with that. They will keep that system, not just next year, but for 10 years and for a long time thereafter. If the proposal was just one more step towards independence, the SNP would not fear it, as it obviously does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the key arguments that the SNP has put forward—it has also been supported by the Conservatives—is that an Assembly settlement would be unstable and would lead to an endless conflict between the Scottish Parliament and the Westminster Parliament over power and money. To a certain extent that is true. It is true of any constitutional arrangement that has a division of power. It is true within the United Kingdom at the moment, not simply between Westminister and the Scottish Office, but between Westminster and local government. In every area where there is a division of powers and responsibilities, there will be conflicts of that sort. That does not lead to long-term instability provided that the general framework is accepted by all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conflict does not happen just within the United Kingdom: it is happening within the European Community even now. There are constant disputes between member states and national Governments, and between national Governments and the European Commission. The SNP, in proposing that Scotland remains within the European Community, accepts the reality of such conflicts. It must also accept that on occasion, on some issues, it will be on the losing side of those arguments. There is nothing different or unstable or peculiar about the conflicts and negotiations that would take place between a Scottish Parliament and Westminster. The SNP does not reject that principle because it is willing to embrace those problems within the European Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole notion of independence in Europe is a completely phoney slogan. There are no truly independent states in western Europe any more, not even the United Kingdom. All states within the European Community have to accept the obligations of collective decision making by majority vote, even when, on occasion, the vote goes against them. The SNP accepts that in Europe, so why does it have such a fundamental objection to that within the United. Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I asked them if they felt that that would enhance their

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Time and again, the SNP puts forward arguments that are nonsense. To argue that by separating from the United Kingdom we would somehow increase Scotland's influence and strength in Europe is nonsense. The arguments put forward by the SNP clearly illustrate that. The SNP makes great play out of the fact that if Scotland had separate representation within the European Community, instead of having eight Members of the European Parliament, it would have 16. However, those 16 would be included in a total of 526 Members of the European Parliament, assuming that their number would be increased to include the Scottish contingent. Surely, 16 out of 526 compares unfavourably with 72 out of 650 Members of Parliament currently representing the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In percentage terms, the SNP would have 3 per cent. of Members of the European Parliament, compared to the 11 per cent. representation that Scottish Members have in the United Kingdom Parliament. If the SNP finds that 11 per cent. representation is inadequate and thinks that 72 Members of Parliament out of 650 are too few to defend Scotland's interests in the United Kingdom, how can it believe that 16 out of a total of 526 Members of the European Parliament would provide adequate or strong enough representation? That idea is simply absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to the notion of having three votes in the Council of Ministers. Three out of a total of 79 votes cast in the Council of Ministers would still be less than 4 per cent. and less than Scotland has within the United Kingdom Parliament. As for the notion that a separate Scotland could take its turn at chairing the European presidency, that, too, is rapidly becoming out of date. Proposals are now coming forward in the Community that would clearly distinguish between its larger and smaller members. The smaller members would rotate the vice-presidency and the larger members would rotate the presidency among themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Scotland would have a permanent opportunity to become vice-president of the European Community and play second fiddle to England, which would have a permanent opportunity to become its president. The problem with the SNP's position is that it no longer believes in full independence. That party is no longer genuinely nationalist and does not want Scotland to have full sovereignty over its own affairs. To use the SNP's terminology, it will never accept a political settlement in Europe whereby Scotland could be dictated to. A Scottish voice on trade, competition, agriculture, fishing, monetary and interest rate policies could be outvoted.</p>

At the heart of the debate is the question of democracy and every speaker today seems to have invoked the name of the Scottish people, so why should I be different? I believe that the Scottish people are sick to death of being palmed off with the trappings of democracy while being denied access to the reality that any genuine democracy would guarantee to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough to hold general elections in this country every four or five years, to have multi-party choices in those elections or to be able to vote for one's own candidate or party if, at the end of that process, those who have been elected are effectively shut out from any influence on Government decisions. When my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) referred to the lack of democracy in Scotland, the Secretary of State looked at Opposition Members and asked, "Are they not democratically elected?" Why are there 63 Opposition Members and only nine Conservative Members? That shows that there is a lack of democracy in Scotland but Conservative Members seem totally incapable of understanding it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a few weeks, Scotland could well return 72 Members of Parliament from only three political parties—the Labour party, the Liberal Democrat party and the Scottish National party—and not one Tory. Yet it is entirely feasible that in those circumstances, of Scotland's absolute rejection of the Tory party, it might still be governed by a Tory Government. Any status quo that permits such circumstances—as the present does—cannot be described as democratic. All who support such a status quo in Scotland cannot genuinely portray themselves as democrats and those who do can only be described as opportunists who have put their own personal and party-political interests first and have relegated the interests of the people, the nation and democracy to a poor second place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
There are two major political parties in Scotland which are working to leave that undemocratic status quo unaltered by the result of the next general election. I refer to the Tory party and the Scottish National party, both of which, from simple self interest, have decided to stand aside from the Scottish Constitutional Convention and to pursue their own party-political interests rather than the genuine national interests of the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall deal briefly with the Tories. Faced with a growing rebellion in their own country against the Westminster state, they have decided not to listen and have chosen to ignore a growing national consensus for change. Theirs has become the politics of saying, "No, never, not an inch and no surrender." Although Conservatives claim to form the only party that promotes choice, it is the only party in Scotland that is denying its people any choice on how they are governed. We can have the Westminster status quo or the Westminster status quo—that is what Tories are saying to the Scottish people and that is why there is a real likelihood that they will not be returned at the next general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presented with the opportunity to become part of a genuinely national movement to win Scotland its own Parliament, the SNP members have reacted in their own sectarian fashion—one which is becoming all too typical of its political stance in the 1990s. Like Tories, they will not listen to other Scottish voices and, like Tories, it has to be their way or no way. Their opportunism is the worse for being patently dishonest. They know that they cannot win the general election and among the easier seats which they have to win are those in which they stand second to the Labour party. In Motherwell, North, it is not only second to the Labour party but 23,500 votes behind it. [

	<div class='membercontribution'>: They do not like what I am saying and that is why they keep interrupting me. I remind the Committee that in Motherwell, North, the SNP trailed the Labour party by 23,000 votes and that is counted as one of the easy seats that it must win to reach its target of 37.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are much more difficult seats where the SNP is in third and fourth place. Everyone present knows that it cannot win 37 seats at the next general election. That is why Scottish National Members are so dishonest when they put such proposals to the Scottish people. Both they and the Tories are political opportunists who are putting their personal and party interests before the interests of the Scottish peole as a whole.

There is another way forward for Scotland—a way that holds out much more hope for the Scottish people. It is the way of the Scottish Constitutional Convention. Party politics when pursued for selfish ends can only divide the Scottish people. What they need now is something to bring them together so that they can win for themselves a Parliament. That something is the Scottish Constitutional Convention. On 9 April, the date on which we all believe the election will be held, a simple choice will face the Scottish people: they can ensure that the status quo

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the limited time available it is fair for us to conclude that two points have emerged this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, in response to an intervention from me, the Secretary of State confirmed that the Government's position on these vital issues is that they are searching. They are waiting with Lord Home to see how the wind blows when there is a hurricane staring them in the face. It seems that only they are not aware of the deep feelings that exist in Scotland on these vital issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it has emerged clearly from the speeches of my hon. Friends and others that the Scottish people will be neither bribed nor bullied into accepting the status quo on the one hand or independence on the other. We have the right to produce a different format so that our democracy in Scotland can be truly expressed. We agree with neither of those extremes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State sought refuge with Lloyd George. That was appropriate in many ways because did not he personify Lloyd George's own expression that a Tory nation is a tired nation? What we have seen today is a tired Government who are unable to adapt their ideas to the aspirations of the Scottish people, who are unable to see that our people want, nay, demand a say in the kind of health service we have, in education, in community care and the issues that are vital to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Devolution already exists. There are 7,000 civil servants in Scotland. But what about accountability? Does not democracy mean that there ought to be that element of accountability? We do not even have a Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. The Select Committee on Health, which is supposed to deal with health affairs in the United Kingdom—I pay tribute to its Chairman and members—cannot and will not discuss Scottish issues. Mention has been made of local government which is an important ingredient in our democracy in Scotland, whatever form the future governance of Scotland takes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger). During my period as vice-president and president of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities I recall him working with us to try to get agreement on the levels of rate support grant. After not just hours or days, but months of discussion and consultation all we got in the Westminster Parliament was an hour and a half's debate on an order that affects every household in Scotland. That form of government is totally unacceptable in the modern age, especially when dealing with important issues, such as community care and caring for the most vulnerable in our society.

Why do we not have a forum here in Edinburgh to listen to the tremendous input of the care in the community working group of the Scottish Society for the Mentally Handicapped or the various forums on disability that helped the recent Standing Committee on the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Bill? The Government pushed through yet another measure that was largely unacceptable to the people of Scotland. Instead of that democractic input, the Government, as they have done with the health service, will ask some of their Tory business friends to take decisions about local communities. How do they expect that to continue without the people saying that
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
enough is enough? To quote a contemporary of Lloyd George, "What sort of people do they think we are?" The people of Scotland want a say in their affairs. The people of Scotland are, indeed, disturbed about the way that we have conducted ourselves in recent times and about the fact that imposed upon them in so many fields has been an alien and unacceptable philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time does not allow me to refer to our friends in the Scottish National party who take a wholly different view from us. I would merely say that when I hear some of the pledges that they make and their failure to answer the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) made about the exchange rate mechanism and currency and the rest, I am reminded of James Bond's comment that it is "an arduous task, Miss Moneypenny". It is not one that Scottish National Members will accomplish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude my all too brief speech by saying that sentimental assumptions, fond hopes and leaps in the dark will not put people in Coatbridge back into jobs. It cannot be right to play with people's hopes, particularly while the recession is howling like a storm in a nightmare. What we demand and what the people of Scotland will support are the aspirations that have been expressed by the Scottish Constitutional Convention which has done such a great service to the people of Scotland. I recognise that when we have this Parliament within the United Kingdom it will contain a rich tapestry of individual political opinion. That is the way it should be. I will not necessarily share all those opinions, but for my part, I believe that democratic socialism is still the language of priorities for Scotland. Nationalism is the language of nostalgia. Toryism is the language of grief. The Scottish people know which philosophy will take them out of recession and back to prosperity and they will not shirk from taking a positive decision when the moment comes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State made a ringing declaration that HMS Devolution was holed below the water line and sinking. As he was a Brylcreemed boy sailor on the decks of the last flagship, HMS Poll Tax, and stood on the burning deck as the ship went below the water he should perhaps avoid watery metaphors. But he proceeded with the rest of his speech to demonstrate all the aplomb of the captain of the Titanic. That would be a matter for rejoicing only if the ship that was sailing for the rocks was merely the Scottish Conservative and Unionist party but the ship that is currently in danger of being holed below the water line and sinking is the Union of Scotland and England itself. That would mean the loss of all the good things that have been achieved over the centuries in that Union—all the friendships, all the marriages, all the involvement in industry and academic life and all the achievements in fighting fascism and standing shoulder to shoulder in dark days. That is the measure of Tory irresponsibility in this debate. For their own interests and out of a false reading of their own interests they are risking the sinking of the good ship Union. Unless we are rescued on 9 April with the ejection of this Government from office that may well be the outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The leader in 
	<i>The Times</i> this morning is extraordinarily significant and I am the second to quote it. It opens with the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are several candidates for the title of John Major's best achievement … For the distinction of being his greatest blunder, however, his misreading of the Scots has few equals."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
That has emerged in the course of the debate. Tory irresponsibility—playing fast and loose with the Union—began in 1979 when Lord Home announced that he would search for a better alternative, yet none was forthcoming; was accelerated in 1983 when the then Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), promised that there would be no poll tax, yet a poll tax was imposed on Scotland with no democratic mandate; and gathered extraordinary pace in 1987 when, faced with having to govern the country with a risible rump of only 10 Members of Parliament, the Conservatives started to stuff Scottish Committees and Scottish business time in the House of Commons with union jack-waving boors imported from English constituencies to wreck and disrupt Scottish business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The irresponsibility reached its apogee in the bizarre and almost unbelievable alliance of Scottish Conservatives with the Scottish National party. They attempt to pretend to the Scottish people that there are only two choices—pristine Union, red, white and blue, with no surrender or complete separation. As we are trying to show, that is simply untrue. It is a lie. There are not only two choices when a marriage starts to go wrong—either to continue with what is making the marriage bad or divorce; there is a third option of making the marriage better through both parties working harder at it. That is what the convention is trying to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not blame the SNP for climbing aboard the Tory train. It is the equivalent of the sealed train that the Kaiser gave Lenin to carry him back to Russia to ferment revolution, on the basis that "my enemy's enemy is my friend". I blame, and history will indict, the Conservative and Unionist party if the result of that is the end of the Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am the third person to say that if confronted with the choice between the status quo and independence, I would opt for independence. Conservative Members should not be surprised by that. Millions of us will make that choice. That, however, is not the option on offer on 9 April in the last chance saloon of the general election. I am not one to argue that Scotland cannot be independent, as 
	<i>The Daily Record</i> or other parts of the Scottish establishment do. They say that we are not big enough, good enough or rich enough. We are good enough, big enough and rich enough to be independent. The issue is whether that is the best option for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition say that there is a better way, which is a home rule Parliament with a reforming Government at Westminster changing the voting system and the other aspects of our society that need to be changed. If we do not have to, we do not want to unpick the national debt and the national insurance fund, or break up the armed forces and build a Scottish army, navy and air force. If we do not have to, we do not want to break up all that we have achieved over the years, but if we must, we certainly will. The Tories should take that on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not offer a second-best alternative to that which is on offer from the SNP. We in the convention come here with our flags flying—our Labour, Liberal and Scottish flags—and we believe that the people will choose our way on 9 April.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland is not a region; it is a country. Scotland is not the northern part of England; it is a nation. That must be emphasised repeatedly. Unfortunately, the Secretary of State does not understand that. He parades himself as some sort of governor-general looking after some far-distant outpost of empire. One would expect that, because the Secretary of State and his colleagues represent Tory policies and the class system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in Scotland know all about that. We know about job losses, homelessness, poverty wages, derisory pensions, cuts in services—especially the health service—the poll tax and the crisis in the economy. It is one of the worst crises ever endured by people in Scotland and in England since the war. Even the CBI in Scotland has doubts about the Government, hence its various statements. The Secretary of State would be given the bum's rush if he were running one of the companies in the CBI. That will happen when the election comes. The Secretary of State knows the price of everything, but the value of nothing. He harps on about taxation, but that is not what we are worried about. We are concerned about establishing a Scottish Parliament which will speak about power and socialist policies. The issue is who owns and controls the wealth of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should learn from history. Many of my colleagues have spoken today about Ireland. James Connolly, who came from this city and who was involved in the Irish struggle, warned the Irish people that they could have a Parliament of sorts and raise the green flag. The bankers in Brussels will still be in control unless there is public ownership under workers' control. Connolly was correct then and, if he were still alive, he would still be correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must understand what we mean by a Scottish Parliament. We want not a sham Parliament but a Parliament that represents the interests of the majority of people in Scotland. The nationalists argue for independence within Europe. I would not rubbish that option, but it would be independence within the EC so long as the bureaucrats allowed it. That would not be independence at all; it would be a sham. If it were real independence, it would be worth considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shortly, there will be a general election and we shall know the voice of the people. We must proceed on the basis of a democratic vote. That will not happen here today, as we know, but we shall soon know the result of the election. I suggest that there will be a mandate for Members of Parliament to come back to this place, discuss the future of Scotland and replace words with action. It is time that Scottish representatives understood that we are going out to get votes that will reflect the wishes of the Scottish people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are historic times. Rarely has the constitutional question been so much to the forefront of the thinking of the people of Scotland. No longer is the matter restricted to politicians with their vested party interests or to nationalists and closet nationalists whose visions of the governance of Scotland are based on a misty, 19th century, Scots Porridge Oats version of nationhood. The government of Scotland is now a live issue among the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
The Government condemn this debate as unnecessary and irrelevant. The status quo has served us well, they say. At every turn they put down the discussion, attempt to trivialise the Scottish Constitutional Convention and patronise our people for even daring to discuss the options open to Scotland. Yet we know the truth. In some ways the Secretary of State is right, for my constituents have other priorities—unemployment, finding jobs and decent housing, earning a fair wage and having a good health service. Those are the priorities. The irony for the Secretary of State is that the Government have allowed Scotland to be ravaged by unemployment and are selling out our health service by allowing hospitals to opt out against people's wishes. He is creating the circumstances in which he is an impotent witness to the public destruction of the Scottish steel industry for these reasons and many more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is because of the culpable neglect of Scotland by the so-called Government of the Union that the people of Scotland want—now more than ever—long-term solutions to the priority problems and to the constitutional arrangements that have allowed a Government with no popular Scottish support to create vast wastelands of poverty and neglect in their country and to use them, the people, as guinea pigs for the poll tax and privatisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the Secretary of State that he should not blame others for the current debate about the government of Scotland. He should not adopt his typical supercilious condescension about the constitutional convention. Despite his protests, the Committee and the people know that he is to blame. It is his hands that are stained with unemployment, poverty, neglect and industrial decline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On behalf of my constituents I say how dare the Secretary of State attack the convention's proposals; they are born of consensus, which is anathema to the Government's tyrannical approach. The proposals are well worked out. Sensible and even-handed, they will create a Parliament in Scotland that will give democratic expression to the existing administrative system, a system that the Government head with no democratic control or accountability. We want better government for Scotland. We want a Government who care and a Scottish Parliament that would have prevented the poll tax. We want a Parliament that will claim the future for our children and our industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State bleats his criticisms because he knows that our proposals are growing in popularity every day. They have the support of the majority of people in Scotland because they have been created by a broad framework within the constitutional convention. Of course, the Labour party has fundamental political differences with the Liberal Democrats, but Scotland will applaud the fact that despite those differences, a huge degree of consensus has been achieved. Why is that? It is because while the Tory Government have put Scotland last, we put it first. Our Scottish Parliament will give Scotland the best from Britain and Europe. So while the Secretary of State maligns our plan for better government and perpetuates cheap scare stories, he should remember the truth of the economic ruin, the high unemployment and the company closures that are the reality of having a Tory Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will have a Scottish Parliament, and we will have a Labour Government at Westminster. The great reality is that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) will be the Secretary of State for
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
Scotland in eight weeks. In one year from now, from this very moment, the Labour party's Scotland Bill will become law. Scotland will win. There will be no diversions. The public will see the unholy alliance of the Tories and the nationalists for what it is—a cynical and self-serving attempt to weaken Labour's position. It will not happen because the people of Scotland see through the nationalists in the same way that they see through the Tories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nationalists present a vision of Scotland as an old-fashioned 19th century nation, full of grandiose pomp and paraphernalia. Scotland rejects that concept. The people know that Scotland will survive in a modern Europe when Labour provide a modern Scottish Parliament that is designed to take Scotland forward into the next century and beyond. The nationalists plan is not only ill-conceived; it is no more than a public relations exercise by a party that is gasping its last few breaths. We have exposed the fallacies of their so-called Queen's speech. People know that the nationalist economics would bankrupt Scotland. They also know that talk of Scottish embassies, a separate Scottish currency, an exchange rate between Scotland and other countries, and a Scottish army and navy are the product of a grandiose nationalist delusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It occurs to me that the nationalists' next proposal might be to call their Scottish currency a sillar. We might then have 10 sillars to the Scottish pound. When he changes his mind again, there might be 30 sillars to the pound; but do not want even one Sillar to the Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nationalists are an irrelevant and spoiled party which clearly act against the interests of working people in Scotland. They are so-called socialists in Glasgow and Tories in the north. A vote for the SNP in Stirling would see the present hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) the Minister of State, returned. That is why 
	<i>The Sun</i> supports the SNP—to allow the Tories in by the back door.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Constitutional Convention has produced a plan. We are grateful to everyone for his or her contributions to the consensus. The Labour party will produce the Parliament that Scotland needs and wants, which is why the people support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Herbert Spencer once said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The greatest barrier to all human progress is contempt prior to investigation".</p></blockquote>
That is what the Tories and nationalists are guilty of. They rubbish our plans because they do not further their narrow and selfish party aims and not because the plans have no merit. The people of Scotland know that the Tories' contempt is for the convention and for Scotland. Scotland under Labour is on the brink of a constitutional solution, which it badly needs. We will not be diverted from our task. A Labour Government are almost a reality. We are within a few short weeks of achieving that reality for Scotland. I say to the people of Scotland that they should cast aside the Tories and the Scottish Nationalist party and let Labour get on with the job of constructing the Parliament that Scotland so desperately needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice that the debate was called at the behest of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Not surprisingly, the Scottish Office has ordered 150 copies of "Towards Scotland's Parliament" to be made available to the Committee. I hope that the Government paid for them. I was expecting a serious forensic attack on our proposals with detailed criticisms and a critique, but we had none of that. The Secretary of State weaved his own fiction about what is not in the convention proposals and then proceeded to rubbish his own creation. After five hours of debate, the Secretary of State has entirely failed yet again to defend the indefensible—the status quo. He suggested that he does not have any responsibility to do that, yet one member of the Committee after another has exposed the frustration and dissatisfaction of the people of Scotland for the present arrangement and its inadequacy and lack of democratic accountability. Until the Secretary of State and his party come forward with constructive proposals, modifications, suggestions or amendments to the scheme put forward by SCC, he will increasingly fail to convince not only the people of Scotland of his argument, but more and more people in his party and his supporters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting and predictable that an attack was made on taxation, but not on the proposals for the convention. We must remember that assigned revenues within the convention would account for about 50 per cent. of the total budget. That substantial part of the revenue would be buoyant and related to the state of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservatives' extraordinary argument is that if people voted for the convention scheme they would be voting for high taxation. It ignores the fact that the scheme allows the rate of tax in Scotland to be varied up or down and that what is being proposed is a democratically elected Scottish Parliament. If the people of Scotland do not wish to vote for parties that are likely to increase taxes or if they wish to vote for parties that want to reduce taxes, they can do so. The Conservative party has written off its ability to win any political argument at any level in Scotland. Surely it is up to the people of Scotland to decide how they should be governed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) tantalised us for a little while with the idea that he was about to suggest an alternative. He made it clear that the only workable alternative was the Liberal Democrats' proposal of a federal solution, but that he would not support it. The right hon. Gentleman acknowledged that there was something wrong with the status quo, but he had nothing in mind to replace it. He was not in favour of the SCC proposals nor was he in favour of independence in or out of Europe. He demolished the entire edifice and left us with no idea of what he had to offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share with the Committee the known fact that the right hon. Member for Ayr is the chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland, whose main European partner is the Bank of Santander, which is based in the most devolved region of Spain. Apparently, the Royal Bank of Scotland
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
is thriving in that relationship. Clearly, the right hon. Gentleman's message is, "Don't do as I do, do as I say—if you can understand what I am saying."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have ignored the dynamic benefits—the non-measurable benefits—of unlocking the enterprise of the Scottish people by giving them their own forum. That may have afforded them opportunities that might have created a Scottish gas company and a Scottish telecommunications industry instead of branch operations of privatised United Kingdom monopolies. Such opportunities could, and should, be available to the people of Scotland. The message that comes from the Conservative party is that Scottish people must be defended from the consequence of their votes. That is essentially what the Government are telling the people of Scotland, and that is what is making those people so angry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State, Scottish Office, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) is shaking his head. He is a classic example of such an attitude. I have watched the hon. Gentleman since he and I became Members of Parliament. He has a clear, consistent and honest ideology. I disagree with it, but understand and respect it. He argues it with a great deal of vigour. However, where I take issue with the hon. Gentleman is that he has completely failed to carry the people of Scotland with him and is insisting on using the majority of Members who do not represent constituencies in Scotland to impose policies against the wishes of the people of Scotland, even when they have been consulted directly. That is not democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer briefly to the long speech of the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond). He criticised the SCC proposals on the grounds that they would not produce stability. How much stability has been provided over the past three years by the Scottish National party's campaigns in Scotland to promote non-payment of the poll tax, to refuse to work with the all-party steel and coal campaign and to refuse to be part of the SCC and to unite the home-rule movement behind the proposal for a Parliament that could work and could meet the aspirations of Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's fundamental claim is not only that, with one bound, without complications, Scotland will be free, which is questionable, but that we shall automatically and, by definition, be much richer. His tone has changed: he suggests no longer that we are invited to vote for the Scottish National party as a party of Government, on which basis he will presumably now disband his shadow Cabinet. He favours repaying the poll tax to people who paid the 20 per cent. charge, an amnesty for those who have not paid, nationalising the steel industry, liquidating housing debt, opening 50 embassies in 50 lucky countries—presumably starting with England—and cutting taxes. That is an ambitious programme. It is Mickey Mouse economics. In the hon. Gentleman's independent Scotland, Jiminy Cricket should be the mascot and the national anthem should be "When we wish upon a star".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The flaw in the criticism of the convention is that it has not taken account of the comments of people outside the convention whose disagreement with it is not on principle. The convention's doors were always open to other people and they remain open. The convention is meeting in Edinburgh this Friday. Conservative Members, Scottish National Members and people from the business community who recognise the reality of what is happening
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
will be welcome to come along to give us the benefit of their views and constructive suggestions. That debating challenge has not been taken up so far. There have been calls for a great debate, but none of those to whom I have referred has suggested how the proposals should be modified or improved or spoken of other matters that require consideration. There have been criticisms of non-existent aspects of the proposals. Some people suggest that the proposals are a bad thing in general because they do not like them and were not party to them. The people of Scotland have been consulted and all their representatives have been invited to participate. That remains true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members discussed relations between Scotland and the development of the European Community. The timing of this debate, and the upsurge of demand for autonomy for Scotland, is especially appropriate in the light of events in other member states of the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One Scottish National Member gratuitously said that our proposals would devalue the Scottish nation and put it alongside Catalonia, Bavaria or the Basques. I hope that the people of Scotland will not support such arrogance. The Catalans, Basques and Bavarians are nations every bit as much as the Scots. We should make common cause with them, not set ourselves apart.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady knows that, as a signatory of the Claim of Right, I accept the right of self-determination. The Spanish Government—the Conservatives should take note—have given the Basques and Catalans the right of self-determination, which they have exercised to secure autonomy within the Spanish state. There are at least six nations within the Spanish state, which is even more diverse than the United Kingdom. Some tendencies in Spain are towards disintegration but Spain has dealt with them in an adult, modern and democratic fashion. It is the most successful modern expanding economy and democracy in the new Europe. We have much to learn from people in other countries. Federalism or quasi-federalism is the developing form of government in almost every member state. Belgium has been a full federation for two years. It—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Under-Secretary may laugh but though Belgium has considerable difficulties, it responds to them constructively and democratically. Germany is an established federation and has been able to absorb several new provinces. Regional parliaments have been established in Italy. Even France proposes to strengthen regional government along those lines. We advocate a course that would work with the grain of the European Community. Conservative and Scottish National Members should realise that such a pattern would put us in tune, not at odds, with the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the Conservatives have been in confrontation with the Community because of their British nationalism. The SNP wants Scotland to follow that road. That course achieves not greater influence but marginalisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
My party accepts the benefits of the Union. We want reform so that the Union may continue and progress into the next century. The way to defend the Union is to accept the case for reform, not resist the overwhelming demand for change. It is deeply depressing that the Conservative party has got into such a tangle. The Prime Minister said at the weekend that he loved the Union and would defend it. I do not think that he said that he would defend it to the death but he is danger of loving it to death if he will not respond to the demand for change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are giving us a strange message: they will not acknowledge any case for reform until after the general election, when they will review the matter. That is a clear message to the people of Scotland and I hope that they will not ignore it. If they defeat every Conservative candidate at the general election, they will get their Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Scotland would be well-advised to examine the proposals of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, which have been the subject of hard work and negotiation by people who have tried to produce a scheme that deals with the needs and wishes of the people of Scotland. There has been no constructive criticism or sustained contribution that could amend or improve the scheme. I regret that because our minds are not closed against such contributions. First, however, they must be offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Scotland cannot much longer continue in the present limbo. We cannot continue to accept the Secretary of State's right to tell us what will happen on all aspects of domestic policy regardless of our views, letters to him and his Ministers or our wishes expressed through the ballot box. He continues to decide and the people of Scotland are shut out of decision making. That is not democracy. I repeat the question that I have asked the Secretary of State more often than I care to remember and for which I have had no answer. The Government argue that the people of Scotland can have independence if they vote for it but if they vote overwhelmingly for reform of the United Kingdom, they will be denied it. What sort of democracy is that? It is not defensible, modern or acceptable. The people of Scotland have shown remarkable patience to date but it will soon run out. The Secretary of State and his Ministers will have to accept the case for a Scottish Parliament and recognise that the SCC has done more to advance the argument for constructive reform of the United Kingdom than any body in modern history. He and his party may yet have to join it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It has always been the case that if people are asked whether they think that a Scottish Parliament would be a good idea, many will say yes. That was true in 1978–79 when some 60 per cent. of people said that. They did not vote that way. That poll also showed major differences in opinion when people were asked about taxes and paying for a Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We know where Opposition Members stand in relation to their electorates at the next election. Opposition Members will doubtless be honest and truthful and make it clear that if their electors vote for them and the Labour party forms a Government, they will not represent their constituencies on housing, planning, health, education, industry or local government. Labour Members will tell the electorate that 72 Members of Parliament are still needed, but they will not represent their constituents on all those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that there was not a majority in the referendum. There was a majority in favour of a Scottish Assembly. A larger percentage of people voted in the referendum for a Scottish Assembly than voted for the Secretary of State in his Galloway and Upper Nithsdale constituency. The proposal has more legitimacy than the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that when people are faced with detailed, hard questions they change their position. That has happened and the hon. Member will find that that is consistent. The reality of this debate, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) and my hon. Friends the Members for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) and for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said, is that a case for change must be made and a scheme that will work must be put forward. Neither of those things has happened. We have heard no response to that argument during the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way, but it will have to be for the last time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, who is a reasonable man, talked about answers to questions. Will he answer
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
the Galloway question before he resumes his place? How many times has the Secretary of State led a United Kingdom delegation to Europe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the hon. Gentleman that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has attended many Council meetings as part of the United Kingdom delegation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gordon endeavoured to make the case that the Liberal Democrats and the Labour party have a united front on this issue, but when we get down to the hard questions, there is no united front at all. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) told us in the Usher hall debate, "If I have an ambition as a politician it is to be Secretary of State for Scotland and nothing else." That is a perfectly reasonable proposition, but I have news for him. The Liberal Democrats say in the 
	<i>Liberal Democrats News</i> of 15 November 1991,
	<br><blockquote><p>"With a Scottish Prime Minister heading up a Scottish Parliament there would be no need for a Secretary of State for Scotland."</p></blockquote>
So the Labour party wants a Secretary of State for Scotland but the Liberal Democrats do not. That is important because the Secretary of State for Scotland is in Cabinet to argue Scotland's case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After a Scottish Parliament is set up, the Labour party wants 72 Scottish Members of Parliament in Westminster for understandable electoral reasons. The Liberal Democrats—I give them credit for this—accept that there is a problem and they want 60. So the two parties disagree on the role of the Secretary of State and on the number of Westminster Members of Parliament, and they do not even agree on a voting system. The Labour party tells the people of Scotland that within a year of a Labour Government, there will be a Scottish Parliament. How will Members be elected to that Parliament? The Labour party says, "We haven't managed to agree on that. We'll tell you after the election." All sorts of systems have been suggested—AMS, ATV, STV, Sky news. Goodness me! A huge number of proposals have been made. We are now told that there will be a first-past-the-post system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman can give me the answer to that question I shall gladly give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the hon. Gentleman has read about the proposal for a system that will close the gap between votes cast and seats gained, that is based upon an additional member system and that, I think, meets the needs of a modern constitution. If the Minister objects to our imprecision, what does he make of the fact that the Prime Minister says on a Saturday that there will be no change, but then rushes to the press and says, "Of course, we will think again after the general election"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is untrue, but it gives me the opportunity to reply to some of the wholly misleading articles in the press. Our position is clear—we shall defend the union of the United Kingdom before and after the general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister listened to the Prime Minister when he said that after the election he will take stock of the situation. What does that mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Goodness me! Any Prime Minister would take stock of the situation after a general election. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that a Government—Labour,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
Conservative or any other—would not take stock of the situation? I have never heard so much rubbish from the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On hard question after hard question, the Opposition have failed to come up with the answers. The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) was present earlier. The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) is not present—I do not criticise him for that—but his question has not been answered. Was he correct or not? I think that he was correct. He was both courageous and truthful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats are not even united in their objectives. The hon. Member for Gordon referred to a federal or quasi-federal system. However, that is not the position taken by its chief negotiator, Mr. McCreadie, who has been locked away since he made his statement. He must be in the same cupboard as the hon. Member for Linlithgow. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I want the Scottish Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Labour party to move from a position of passive acceptance of Independence to active encouragement of it."</p></blockquote>
He is not an ordinary member of the party, but its chief negotiator, and all the time that he has been negotiating he has wanted not a federal or quasi-federal system but a first step to independence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I have already given way twice to the hon. Gentleman and have been very generous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gordon said that we had not tackled some of the detailed proposals of the convention. Let me refer to the issue of entrenchment which, apparently, is central to the SCC's position. That is a con and a fraud. There cannot be entrenchment because no Parliament can bind its successor—the matter is as simple as that. It is a fraud and a con to suggest otherwise and Opposition Members must know that in their hearts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had no answers to our questions about costs and taxes. I do not blame the shadow Chancellor, the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
Smith), for not being present, but he intervened twice and did not tell us what the position would be. However, we know that an Assembly would have powers to raise taxes such as income tax. The hon. Member for Garscadden smilingly said that it was the power to vary tax—it could go up or down. Does anyone in his right mind believe that the Assembly that he wants would reduce taxation? Of course it would not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because the hon. Gentleman wants more public expenditure. Of course, that is only one of the extra taxes that the Labour party proposes to impose on the people of Scotland but there are others. A new tax proposed the other day was the training tax on business. The Labour party would remove controls on business rates and all controls on local authority expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that in the debate we would hear not only slogans and a lot of chat but real answers from the Opposition to these and other questions, starting with the West Lothian question. What about the role of Members of Parliament and the Secretary of State and the financial and fiscal relationships between Westminster and an Assembly or Parliament in Edinburgh? We have not heard even the semblance of an answer today. We have heard nothing but a series of slogans, speeches and assertions. That is not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Scotland have a choice between different political parties and they should examine the proposals of the convention in detail. When they do so, they will find that they have offered no workable answers to all our fundamenal questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
