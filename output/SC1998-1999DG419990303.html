	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. John McFall)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Strategic Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
On 18 December 1998, the First Minister designate for Northern Ireland, the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble), and the Deputy First Minister designate, the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon), issued a statement that set out proposals for the restructuring of Northern Ireland Departments and identified the functions for which each Department would be responsible. In that statement, it was agreed that the number of Departments in the new Northern Ireland administration should increase from six to 10, and that existing responsibilities should be redistributed amongst those Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new arrangements, there will be a Department for Regional Development, responsible for strategic planning, and the new Department for the Environment will be responsible for planning control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To empower the Department for Regional Development to carry out its strategic planning functions, the order requires it to formulate a regional development strategy for the long-term development of Northern Ireland. Work on that has already been started by the existing Department of the Environment, and resulted in the recent publication of a consultation paper that contained a draft of a regional strategy offering a framework for developing the region over the next 25 years. When the order comes into force, the new Department for Regional Development will assume responsibility for that strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government gave priority to such work, and on 10 April 1998 gave a commitment in the Belfast agreement to make rapid progress with a regional strategy for consideration in due course by the Assembly. Therefore, it is essential that the Department for Regional Development be provided with the necessary powers to continue with that important exercise. The order will also permit that Department to formulate sub-regional strategies for Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the provisions in the order are similar to those in the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991. To allow the Department to continue with the regional strategy, we considered simply transferring the relevant provisions of that order to the Department under the transfer of functions order, which is a piece of subordinate legislation that redistributes the functions of old Departments. However, legal advice suggested that that could not be
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
done, as the new Department for the Environment would also need those provisions so as to carry out its planning control functions. An order was therefore necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two new articles that do not read across to the planning order. Article 4 places a statutory requirement on the Department for Regional Development to provide policy guidance and advice on the regional strategy and its implementation, and to co-ordinate that implementation. Article 5 places a statutory requirement on other Northern Ireland and United Kingdom Departments to have regard to the regional strategy when exercising any functions in relation to development in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order requires the Department for Regional Development to formulate, in consultation with other Northern Ireland Departments, a regional development strategy for the long-term development of Northern Ireland, to provide policy guidance and advice in relation to the strategy and its implementation, and to co-ordinate that implementation. It also requires all Northern Ireland and UK Departments to have regard to the strategy when exercising any function in relation to development in Northern Ireland. For the purpose of exercising any of the Department's functions under the order, the order will provide it with the power to undertake surveys or studies, to consult any person that it thinks fit, to cause a local public inquiry to be held if it considers that appropriate, and to provide the Minister for Regional Development with the power to appoint advisory bodies or committees to assist the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order complements the other legislation that gives full effect to the new arrangements for devolved government in Northern Ireland, and as such it is a necessary part of it. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.34 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss (Norfh-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my understanding that the order will come into force when the Assembly is up and running. Will the Minister confirm that that will be the case, as suggested in article 1(2)? If the Assembly does not, for some unforseen reason, start on 10 March or on some subsequent date, will the order be held in abeyance? If it is not, will it go through automatically and simply separate two functions in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions as it currently exits, or will there be a different Department for strategic regional planning? Will the Minister clarify what the position would be if the Assembly did not start on the intended date?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 3 sets out the long-term development strategy for Northern Ireland. I was going to ask the Minister what would be his interpretation of long term. He mentioned 25 years. What he did not say was that the regional plan will be valid for up to 25 years. To plan for 25 years is to plan a long time ahead. Will he explain to the Committee how it is possible to implement a strategic plan that will hold up well for that length of time? The plan will surely have to be revisited during those 25 years, to bring it up to date, and to make sure that it is moving in the right direction and that events that have taken place in terms of development control have not obviated the need for the plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0567">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Where do area or district plans fit into the new arrangement? We have a new Department responsible for strategic planning for the whole of Northern Ireland. I assume that it was established following decisions resulting from the 1996 Select Committee report on planning, which recommended a Northern Ireland-wide plan that we had not had before. I assume that the new arrangement builds on those decisions, but the Minister has not told us where local and district plans would fit into the scheme. Will they be part of the remit of the new Department for Regional Development, or will that responsibility remain with the planning control, or development control, section of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4 deals with policy guidance. One assumes that the Department for Regional Development will submit planning policy guidance—PPG—documents similar to those currently dealt with by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions that cover English and Welsh regions. In deciding on planning guidance, will the new Department take into account the PPGs that emanate from its English, Welsh and Scottish counterparts? Will a PPG that comes from the new Department in Northern Ireland override those from mainland Britain?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give a couple of examples. In the future, could Northern Ireland have totally different planning policy guidance for out-of-town shopping and for superstore locations from that pertaining in England and Wales? In the past few months, we have seen a PPG on out-of-town superstore development from the DETR that differed considerably from the earlier guidance from the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second example relates to rural planning and particularly to the development of housing in the countryside. I refer not just to green-field site development of large housing estates, but to the Northern Ireland phenomenon of single dwellings. For many years, there has been a slightly different planning policy in Northern Ireland that seeks to take into account the historical development of single dwellings in the countryside. The settlement pattern is different from that in England and Wales and over many years planning controllers and developers have taken a different view from that taken in mainland Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In future, will the policy guidance that will emanate from the new Department set a completely different framework for single dwellings in the countryside in Northern Ireland from that of England and Wales? Once the Assembly is up and running there will be a powerful political voice for relaxing controls on single dwellings in the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was a Minister, a never-ending queue of Northern Ireland local politicians told me that they wanted additional single dwellings in the countryside and the relaxation of controls. I do not know whether they represented people in their community who felt that they had been badly served by the local planning agency. However, all sections of the political spectrum always considered that the controls on single dwellings in the countryside were far too tight. In Northern Ireland, it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
believed that it is a man or woman's inalienable right if they have a piece of land—and most of them seem to have a piece somewhere—to erect a dwelling on that land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say whether in the future there could be different planning guidance for Northern Ireland for superstores and single dwellings in the countryside?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In exercising any functions …

	<ol>

	<li>a Northern Ireland department; and</li>

	<li>a department of the Government of the United Kingdom;
<br><br><!-- lb --> shall have regard"—</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
those are the key words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the regional development strategy."</p></blockquote>
We may now be into semantics and the legal drafting of such documents. Is the phrase "have regard to" strong enough for enforcement? Will the Minister clarify whether those words are powerful enough to ensure that any development that takes place in Northern Ireland does not stray outside the terms of the development strategy? If it does, will there be a legal enforcement procedure to bring it back into line?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) The Department may undertake, or cause to be undertaken, such surveys or studies as it may consider necessary for the purposes of its functions under this Order".</p></blockquote>
Although it is a future consideration, I ask the Minister about the latest position regarding the Belfast area plan. What progress has been made with that? Is it now back on the shelf or has it been subsumed by the Northern Ireland-wide strategic plan so that it now has to fit into a much wider geographical context? The main problem that planners face in the Belfast area is where to put the houses that are needed for the next 10, 15 or 20 years. Will the Minister tell the Committee what has been decided and what allocations of land have now been granted? Is the decision that was taken a few years ago to cut back on the release of land still in force? Has there been some movement on that? I am referring especially to the release of land in the south-east quarter of Greater Belfast—the Carryduff Down and Saintfield road areas—where much green-field site housing development has taken place in the past 10 to 15 years. A considerable amount of land in those areas has also been earmarked for future development. It would be interesting to know what decisions, if any, have been taken about that release of land, and how the Belfast area is coping with the demand for housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If land is released in that area over the next 10 to 15 years, transport problems will arise. More people would commute into central Belfast and that would resurrect the question of new roads, especially southern approach roads, and of whether the Government see the need for any serious upgrade of roads connecting the south-east periphery with the centre of Belfast.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those questions aside, the order fulfils the requirements of the political parties involved in discussions at the Assembly. Local politicians agreed on the 10 new Departments, of which the Department that we are discussing this morning will be one. There is a need for strategic planning in a Northern Ireland-wide context. For planning reasons, one would caution against the setting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0568">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
up of a Department with considerable powers over issues such as the construction of out-of-town shops and of single dwellings in the countryside. Decisions on such issues might bring the Department into conflict with development control, which will be in the hands of the Department for the Environment. There might be problems, if not conflicts of interest, with the implementation of policy across the two Departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.47 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öopik 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are there objective criteria for determining when the Westminster Parliament would be able to overrule planning decisions taken by a Minister in Northern Ireland? I ask that because such issues have arisen in Northern Ireland before, and it is important that we do not leave their resolution to precedent and to chance. Inevitably, that will hold things up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Otherwise, the order seems to be in line with everyone's expectations. Indeed, as I have problems with strategic planning in my constituency, will the Minister be so kind as to lend the order to his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strangford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have several points to make about the order, the purpose of which I fully understand. My first point was also raised by the Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss), and concerns the timing of the order. In the letter that accompanied the order, the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Order will come into force on the same day as Article 3(1) of the Departments (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 which relates to the creation of the new Departments"—</p></blockquote>
including the Department for Regional Development, which we are discussing today. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This will precede the day on which powers are devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly by the Northern Ireland Act 1998."</p></blockquote>
By how long will the introduction of the order precede the transfer of powers? Will there be a gap of a day, a week, or several weeks? As we are aiming for 10 March as the day on which everything might be in place, it looks to me as though we have only a week left. However, that depends on our achieving that date. What thoughts are there on the idea of the transfer of powers being preceded by the introduction of the order?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That question brings me to the Belfast agreement, which has already been mentioned this morning. The explanatory document states that the event that we are discussing arises from the Belfast agreement. Before there can be a transfer of powers to the new devolved Assembly in Northern Ireland, not only all parties, but all Governments must comply with the requirements of the agreement. It is now 3 March, only seven days before the order can be implemented, and three significant obstacles remain. First, decommissioning—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will understand that while reference to the Belfast agreement is in order because the measure flows from that, I am hesitant to allow debate on the wider issues of the agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You can be sure, Mr. Stevenson, that that is entirely the line I shall take. I am discussing the timing of the order and pointing out with headings the remaining obstacles to be overcome by 10 March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Republic of Ireland is required to create five bodies relating to human rights, but not one has been created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there are the implementation bodies—the six cross-border bodies—one of which is still being debated by the Dublin Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those three outstanding matters affect the timing of the order and it is important to put on the record that they have not yet been brought into operation. One of those obstacles to the transfer of devolution to Northern Ireland concerns the implementation bodies. Article 5 of the order is headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Departments to have regard to regional development strategy."</p></blockquote>
The Department of the Environment at the Northern Ireland Office published an excellent document entitled "Shaping our Future", which was full of facts, but bereft of target dates for results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5 requires the Northern Ireland Departments and Departments of the United Kingdom Government to have regard to regional development strategy, but there is no reference to the role of the implementation bodies in the overall strategic planning policy. Do they not have to have regard to it? Those new institutions are being created and one concerns cross-border transport. I would have thought mat not only the Departments of the devolved Government at Stormont and Her Majesty's Government at Westminster, but the new bodies should have to have regard to the regional development strategy. Article 5 may need to be retitled to read, Departments and bodies
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"to have regard to regional development strategy", followed by an explanation of what those bodies are.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.54 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Members for their comments. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) said that the order arises from the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee report on the planning system. As the then Minister, he agreed to establish a regional planning system following the recommendation from the Select Committee and the order is also his baby. I thank him for his positive comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Member for Strangford (Mr. Taylor) asked about the order being brought into force. My noble Friend Lord Dubs stated in his letter that the order will come into operation on the day appointed for article 3(1) of the order to come into operation. As he said, that relates to the creation of the new Departments, including the Department for Regional Development. It would be a day appointed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and would precede the day on which powers were devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly by the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The strategic planning order will be brought into force after that order is signed, but before the date specified in it for devolution. That is necessary to ensure that the structures agreed by the Assembly are in place for the commencement of devolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister has said is exactly what I said, but then I added the question. "What would be the timing between those two events?" The new departmental structure could precede the date of the transfer of powers, but what would be the time gap between those two events? One could end up with the 10 Departments being created and devolution not taking place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the right hon. Gentleman's point. I can only refer him to the role of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to appoint the day under the Northern Ireland Act 1998 for the commencement of devolution. I am confident that she will do so as soon as she can. However, all the necessary subordinate legislation must be in place, including this order, before she can proceed. That is the best answer that I can give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is clearly a delicate matter. Everything is being set up to go on D-day, but it is likely that under article 1(2) of the Departments (Northern Ireland) Order, these Departments will be set up in advance of a decision by the Secretary of State to establish the Executive under the D'Hondt principle, which requires movement on decommissioning and other matters. Therefore, unless the timing is spot on, under that order this order will come into being, setting up a new Department before the Executive is set up and the Assembly is up and running. If it then falls at that hurdle—this was my earlier point— does the new Department retain its function within the DoE or do we start with a completely new Department in any event?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, it is a difficult process. We are always striving for clarity, which is essential in these issues. The right hon. Member for Strangford said that there were three hurdles to overcome in the next seven days. The words "God speed" have been mentioned and they are the best that I can use on that. The subordinate legislation must be ready to trigger. If devolution does not happen, the existing DoE will continue the strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire asked whether, if the Assembly does not start, the DoE order will continue. The order depends on the Assembly going ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the 25 years for the regional strategy that I mentioned in my opening speech. The plan would be regularly reviewed. It is a matter for the new Departments, but five-yearly reviews, for which the order allows, would be appropriate. The local plans will also come under the DoE for planning control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire also mentioned policy guidance under article 4. The guidance will be similar to the planning policy guidance and the new Assembly will have discretion to follow, or not to follow, the English model for the Assembly.

Out-of-town retailing is a big issue in Northern Ireland as it is everywhere, but the Assembly and the Department for Regional Development will have to deal with that, as other parts of the United Kingdom are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I came to the Committee this morning the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) spoke to me about single houses in rural areas. He was unable to attend
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the Committee but asked me to consider that issue this morning. The new Assembly will no doubt deal with it, and the new guidance could differ from that for England. The new Department for Regional Development will have an obligation to give guidance under the regional plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On article 5, the legal phrase "have regard to", which is well used in British planning law, is strong in reality. The Departments cannot simply ignore the strategy; they must give it serious attention. Therefore, the Government believe that the phrase "have regard to" is sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire also asked what progress has been made on the Belfast area plan. Once the strategy has been adopted, it is proposed that a new plan will be prepared for the Belfast metropolitan area, which will replace the Belfast urban area plan. That process is due to start in 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the lease of land in the Belfast area, the release of 3,500 sites has been announced. Those sites will be required to be built on in accordance with the quality initiative, which was announced in 1996 by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire when he was a Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification, the Minister mentioned 3,500 sites. I presume that he means land for 3,500 houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the hon. Gentleman is correct. Land will be available for 3,500 houses. Sites means houses in this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Plots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, plots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) asked whether Westminster could overrule. That was a perennial question when I was involved in Scottish matters. I must give the same answer that was given for Scotland: once the legislation is enacted, the answer is an unequivocal no. Planning is a transferred matter under the devolution proposal. I shall have an informal conversation with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales with regard to the hon. Gentleman's other query.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Strangford mentioned the implementation bodies. They will report to the new Northern Ireland Administration and will therefore have to have regard to the strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Important points have been raised this morning. I note the overall agreement on the order, the implementation of which will lead to greater and better things for Northern Ireland. I am grateful for the support of Committee members, for the interest that they have shown in the order and for their useful comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
