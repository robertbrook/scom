	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: (Glasgow, Cathcart): I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Personal Community Charge (Reduction for 1990–91) (Scotland) Regulations 1991.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be for the convenience of the Committee to discuss the other two orders before us, namely, The Personal Community Charge (Reduction for 1991–92) (Scotland) Regulation 1991 and The Community Charges (Levying, Collection and Payment) (Scotland) Regulations 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish you the best in the Chair, Mr. Leadbitter, and congratulate Hartlepool united on its promotion from the fourth to the third division. I wish your team all the best in its new division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition prayed against the orders so that we could debate them rather than try to defeat them because, although I have reservations about them, they will provide compensation for some people in Scotland, which it would be foolish to suggest people should not have. Nevertheless, the orders are part and parcel of the shambles that was and, despite all the Government's efforts to persuade people to the contrary, still is the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The poll tax legislation was introduced in Scotland in December 1986. It became law before the 1987 General Election, so the Goverment had no mandate for it, as they had in England. It came into force in Scotland on 1 April 1989. It was introduced in blind panic when the then Prime Minister and the then Secretary of State for Scotland, the right hon. Member for Ayr, (Mr. Younger) faced a hostile Scottish conference that was bitter about the shambolic revaluation that they had introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems of that revaluation lay not in the fact that there was a revaluation, but in the fact that the Goverment mishandled it. Without any idea of what was to be put in its place, the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Scotland decreed that rates were dead. They were forced to introduce the poll tax as no system other than the rates was a viable option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having been born in panic, the poll tax continued in confusion, bungling and more panic. Now, only two years after its introduction, the Government have stood all their principles and logic on their head and announced, again in panic, the long, lingering death of the poll tax and the reintroduction of a rating system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The orders are part of the whole absurd system. Two of them relate to changes in the transitional relief
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
schemes, which of themselves were amendments to the poll tax. Having introduced the poll tax, the Government quickly realised that it was causing them great electoral damage. They have since tried by clumsy and inefficient means—of which the orders are an example—to improve matters. The fact that they are now calling a halt to the whole sorry business shows how far these and previous orders have failed to put right the situation that the Government created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first transitional relief scheme was announced at the Tory party conference in October 1989, only six months after the tax came into operation. Its aim was to give transitional relief to former ratepayers and their partners whose poll tax was more than £156 higher than their previous rates bill. It also helped pensioners and disabled people who previously had not paid rates. It was introduced on 1 April 1990, but backdated to 1 April 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people who should have qualified were excluded because the Government insisted on the relief being based on the ludicrous notional poll tax figures that the Government had announced, and not on the actual poll tax that people were paying. It also caused considerable confusion for local government finance offices who had to recalculate the payments due, re-bill, and waste much valuable time for very little reward. The scheme was due to be revamped from 1 April 1990 when the threshold was lowered to £104 instead off £156. However, that was overtaken by the community charge reduction scheme that we are now debating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.35–10.40 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1991 order, which relates to payment from 1 April 1990, is different from the previous transitional reliefin that while still being based on the £104 qualifying figure and two adults, it will be based on actual poll tax figures and not notional ones. Although backdated to 1 April 1990, the scheme is unlikely to come into effect before June or July of this year. The 1991–92 order again has actual poll tax figures as its base, and while reducing the qualifying sum to £52, the number of adults taken into account is increased from two in a household to the actual number of adults in a household.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be said that local authorities found the existing relief scheme—the original transitional relief scheme cumbersome and an inefficient use of resources. They are convinced that the new scheme is equally complex and will require much work in recalculating eligibility, backdating that to 1 April 1990, recalculating it on the second scheme for 1991–92, using the new criteria, and then recalculating poll tax benefits and rebates because those are affected if people are in receipt of relief under the orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to all that, the Government have introduced the Community Charges (General Reduction) Act 1991, which will cut everyone's poll tax by £140 that is, everyone paying the full amount. Those on rebates will not receive a reduction of £140—though many people seem to be confused about that. Therefore, before making their calculations,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0506">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
local authorities have had to abandon their billing for this financial year and start all over again. That might seem easy for people making the full payment, but many were making their payments by direct debit and bank standing orders. If payments have continued, the local authority must recalculate how much is due for the rest of the year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is a nice sunny morning and I apologise for intervening in the hon. Gentleman's excellent speech on an important subject. However, the hon. member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Kirkhope) has left the Room and we no longer have a quorum. I ask him to return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If people are paying their poll tax by direct debit—as I am—the local authority must work out how much they must pay from July onwards to make up the difference. However, if people have cancelled their direct debit, a different calculation is necessary. In this morning's newspapers, it was reported that Strathclyde regional council has announced that 20,000 people in its region have cancelled their direct debit payments because they did not believe that they had to continue paying. As a result, Strathclyde is facing a deficit of about £70 million—a major crisis. Charles Gray, the council's leader, has said simply that unless the council gets money soon from somewhere, it will have to start laying off staff or, at least, will be unable to pay their wages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, calculations must be made for the £140 reduction for those on rebates because that involves another reduction. After all the calculations have been made regarding the reduction of £140, local authorities have to recalculate everything for those eligible under the 1990–91 order and under the 1991–92 order. The Government have created yet another administrative nightmare to add to the endless nightmares that the poll tax has created for local authorities and poll tax payers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some local authorities are trying to incorporate the £140 reduction and the 1991–92 reduction schemes for issue in the next two months. Other local authorities cannot do that and will find it easier to administer the reduction schemes in two stages with the £140 reduction taken from the first bill and the reduction scheme left to a later stage, probably as late as October. People will receive one bill in June and another, probably a lower one, in October. The whole thing is a mess. If we put on top of this shambles the massive non-payment of poll tax faced by local authorities, some of which dates back to 1 April 1989, we realise that local government faces a major crisis in funding and morale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, many very poor people in Scotland are faced with bills that they simply cannot pay. Before the Minister jumps up and down in his usual fashion—and that of other Government Ministers—saying that non-payment is the result of a wicked non-payment campaign, I assure him that independent research financed by Strathclyde region shows that more than 80 per cent. of those not paying the poll tax are people who simply cannot afford to pay it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
The problem with the Scottish National party and others who have tried to organise non-payment campaigns is that they have consistently given the Government the opportunity to divert attention away from the real non-payment problem hitting the poor and the chaos that the poll tax has created. However, there is growing evidence that the Government's own actions, through orders such as these, have deepened the non-payment crisis. By announcing the abolition of the poll tax and the suspension of all payments for three months, the Government have led many people to believe that they no longer need to pay. Thus they are now even more responsible for the chaos faced by local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of introducing yet more half-baked schemes such as these orders, the Government should immediately abolish the 20 per cent. minimum payment. In their new scheme—the council tax or revised rating system—the Government have admitted that the 20 per cent. minimum payment was wrong. If it is wrong in 1993 or 1994, it is wrong now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government can backdate relief schemes to 1990 and transitional relief schemes to 1989, they should give careful consideration not only to abolishing the 20 per cent. rule but to backdating that abolition to 1 April 1989 or, at least, to 1 April 1990. I accept that that might be difficult, but the Government should consider the possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, many people did not realise that they were eligible for rebates. They did not claim them on due dates and, as a result, lost them. Claims for rebates for those who were eligible for them should be backdated to 1 April 1990. The expression on the Minister's face and on the faces of his advisers shows that they have heard this argument from me before, and they will hear it again and again. Backdating relief schemes and claims for rebates would alleviate some of the problems faced by local government and by poor people in Scotland. However, only the total abolition of the poll tax will do, and it should be abolished as soon as is feasible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However much the Government try to dress up the new scheme, the introduction of the council tax in 1993 or 1994 is nothing but a return to the rating system with some modifications. It is a tax based on the value of a property. People will have pay a sum based on that valuation to the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authority will decide the amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not want to admit that the council tax is the same as the rating system. They claim that it cannot be introduced before 1993 or even 1994 because it is slightly different from the rating system. However, a rating system could be introduced on 1 April 1992 if the Government had the humility and the courage to admit that they were wrong and to act accordingly. They would have to introduce legislation within the next month or six weeks, and the Opposition would support if fully to ensure that rates were reintroduced and the poll tax abolished. The rating system and the Government's new system are sufficiently similar for that to happen. If, by some strange chance, the Conservative party was still in power in April 1992, its members could introduce
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
changes to the rating system which would be in place by 1993 or 1994. However, the Conservative party will not be in power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us hope that the Government will come to their senses before the summer recess. It would be embarrassing for the Minister and the Scottish Office to reintroduce the rating system, but the Minister's red face is less important that the welfare of the Scottish people and sustaining Scottish democratic local government. If the Government refuse to act sensibly, the poll tax will become an election issue, despite their efforts, because local government will sink deeper into crisis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have examined the regulations. Regulation 8 contains the formula "A - (R+52)" and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A and R shall have the same meaning as they have respectively in regulation 7(2)".</p></blockquote>
That is repeated in regulation 8(2) and in regulation 9, although the formula in regulation 9 is different, and refers to regulation 7(3). Regulation 14(2) contains the formula:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(A×C)-[(R×Y)+((C-1)×£52)]"/C</p></blockquote>
and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(i) A, C and R shall have the same meanings as they have respectively for the purposes of paragraph (1)".</p></blockquote>
It then refers to another regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the purposes of easement and comprehension, would it be possible for future statutory instruments to state what the letters stand for, and add the words, "They have the same meaning as they have in regulation …, which is not before us". It is difficult to understand the instrument as it stands. That is not a criticism—those who draft statutory instruments and Bills have a difficult job. However, it is impossible to debate matters legitimately when formulae that affect people appear meaningless because they refer to previous regulations. Statutory instruments could state what letters stood for and explain that they had the same meaning as they had in other regulations. We could then understand what we were discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: (Mr. Allan Stewart): I join the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Leadbitter, and in congratulating Hartlepool united. I accept your point about the complexity of the formulae, and I shall have the matter investigated for future regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister can explain it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I propose to explain the content of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart set out his party's policy with his customary vim and vigour. However, the ranks behind him are far from serried. Indeed, I have never seen more unserried ranks. No Conservative Member would blame the two Labour Members who came briefly into the Room, took one glance at the hon. Member for Cathcart speaking and departed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I saw only one hon. Member, who was not a member of this Committee. He was looking for another Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We hope that he found it. He certainly did not go to round up troops for this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart argued that the Government had no mandate in Scotland for the community charge or the regulations. That argument is unusual for a Front Bench Labour spokesman because it is the argument of the SNP, not that of a party that claims to defend the United Kingdom. Perhaps the hon. Member for Cathcart has read the excellent speech made last Friday by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars)—which destroyed the case for a constitutional convention—who is considering changing parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The unholy alliance between the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) and the Minister will be widely advertised in the Govan constituency at the next general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the hon. Gentleman did not say that the unholy alliance would be widely advertised in the Eastwood constituency as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart is right to say that the regulations revise an earlier scheme. However, I shall show that that revision is a consequence of significant overspending by many Scottish local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly put the content of the regulations on the record. The first two sets of regulations for the community charge reduction scheme provide for assistance to be paid to many charge payers. The expenditure involved will be considerable. The third set of regulations allows for people to be billed for the lower charges, and is not controversial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reduction scheme is, as the hon. Member for Cathcart rightly said, a development of the transitional relief scheme that was introduced just over a year ago. That scheme was intended to provide assistance to households for which the change from domestic rates to the personal community charge caused significantly increased outgoings. The scheme compared the rates paid by a household with the community charges that that household would have had to pay if local authority expenditure had remained constant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authority expenditure did not remain constant, which is why we have had to enhance the transitional relief scheme through the first set of regulations before us. High levels of charge were producing considerable problems for charge payers. No Government could sensibly ignore that—hence the decision to put additional resources into improving the scheme. The introduction of the reduction scheme is a response to the effects of the high charges made by Scottish local authorities. The commitment to backdating the reduction scheme to 1 April 1990 reflects the earlier introduction of the community charge in Scotland.

The 1991–92 scheme, the second set of regulations before the Committee, follows the decision to reduce charges in 1991–92 by means of the Community Charges (General Reduction) Act 1991. That required a reshaping of the scheme. In 1990–91, we built on the existing scheme. As the hon. Gentleman said, the calculation of reductions was based on the differences between a person's or a household's former rates bill and their actual community charge bills for 1989–90. That calculation of reduction for households comprisiong more than one person is based on the aggregate of a maximum of two community charges. A person or household is required to pay the first £2 per week of that difference. Elderly and disabled people who are not former ratepayers are required to pay £104 per year, plus the differences between their actual personal community charge of 1989–90 and that of 1990–91.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase in Government funding of local authority expenditure in 1991–92, which led to the general reduction in charges, has changed significantly the background against which the reduction scheme will operate. We decided therefore that it was necessary to rebase the scheme on the 1991–92 actual charges, which avoids the payment of a double benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main changes involved in the rebasing of the scheme on 1991–92 actual charges are as follows. People and households will be required to pay only the first £1 per week—that is, £52 per year—of any difference between the rates bill and the 1991–92 personal community charge. A person will qualify on the basis of his place of residence on 1 April 1991, instead of 1 April 1989 under the previous scheme. Thus, people who have moved house since 1 April 1989 may still qualify for assistance under the scheme—that was in response to representations. Elderly and disabled people who are not former ratepayers will be required to pay only £52 in 1991–92.

Although the formulae of the package are inevitably complex, the principles are straightforward. It offers a useful supporting mechanism to households that are still coming to terms financially with the change from rates to the community charge. The reason behind the regulations is not the panic alleged by the hon. Gentleman; it is a response to changing circumstances and to the high spending of several Scottish local authorities.

I assure the hon. Gentleman that we intend to introduce the council tax on 1 April 1993. There are an enormous number of significant differences between the council tax and the domestic rating system, to which the hon. Gentleman's party continues to pledge allegiance. I an sure that when the people of Scotland compare the council tax with the effect of reintroducing the discredited, inequitable—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raised the point that some major local authorities say that they cannot complete their final billing until October this year. That unfortanately means that it will be difficult for them to take action to recover money from people who have not paid, as it would be a nonsense to start trying

to recover money from people whose bills may be reduced susbstantially.

Will the Minister explain to the local authorities how he intends to ensure that they will not lose financially?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two answers to that question. First, an advance has been made to local authorities in recognition of the delay in the payments that they will receive. Secondly, much of the trouble has been caused by people—I do not necessarily criticise the hon. Member for Cathcart—saying that the community charge system is dead. That is not the case. The system will operate for this financial year and the next.

Central region has acknowledged its duty to charge payers and has succeeded in sending out a single set of bills, which take account of the £140 general reduction in charges and the 1991–92 reduction scheme. I do not want to make a party political point, so I have used Central region as an example because that authority is under Labour party control. It is also worth noting that authorities south of the border—the great majority—expect to send out, by the end of May, revised bills that will take account of the reduction scheme and the £140 reduction. I accept that better software makes it easier for some authorities than for other, but that shows that those authorities that buckle down to the task are able to send out the bills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cites Central region as an example. Three other regions—Dumfries and Galloway, Strathclyde and Tayside—have also announced that they can send out a single set of bills. Three of the four authorities mentioned are Labour controlled, but there is no political bias in this matter. The authorities that have said that they cannot send out a single set of bills include Fife and Lothian, which are Labour controlled, Grampian, which is under dual control, and Borders, Highland and Orkney, which are not controlled by Labour. All authorities must judge for themselves whether they can send out a single set of bills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I deliberately made no political point, but it is clear that some authorities can send the bills quickly. I see no reason in principle why other authorities should not also be able to do so.

I shall end by emphasising that the council tax will be in operation by 1 April 1993. It is a better, fairer and more equitable tax than the domestic rates, which the hon. Member for Cathcart wishes to reimpose on the people of Scotland. That system is wholly discredited, and people will make a proper judgement between the very fair council tax and the return to the wholly inequitable rating system that is proposed by the hon. Gentleman and his absent friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
