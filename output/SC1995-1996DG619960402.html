	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Public Service Vehicles (Carrying Capacity) (Amendment) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 167).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We give a warm welcome to the two sets of regulations, which reflect the desire constantly to improve safety, especially for our children whose safety is a cause of anxiety for us all. The regulations are mostly the result of the activities of one pressure group, Belt Up School Kids, which was the inspiration of Mrs. Pat Harris, who lives in the glorious county of Gwent and has carried on a tireless campaign for years. I once had the pleasure of speaking at her conference in my constituency. Recently, she turned her attention to improving part of one set of regulations—the rule that allows three children to occupy the places meant for tow adults in school buses. It may be a reasonable rule for very young children, but it certainly is not for older children, who may be similar in size to adults.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, on implementation, we have heard reports of a number of firms that offer to retronfit seat belts for as little as 15 per cent. of the general market cost. All too often they are cowboys who fit totally unsuitable belts that would be useless in a crash. Ill-fitting, unsuitable and inadequate belts are far worse than no belts because they give a false sense of security. At best, they are a cosmetic improvement. Given the pressure on school budgets, vehicle owners will inevitably be tempted by such cheap offers, which could have much greater costs in that they could lead to fatalities. The regulations could lead to an increase in that practice. What measures will the Minister use to improve enforcement of the seat belt standard? There must be some means of finding out which seat belt firms are reliable—perhaps it could be done by licence, or through the use of an approved list. It would be difficult for schools to find out. When local authorities awarded contracts, they could establish which firms were reputable but because of the wide disbursement of budgets, that has become more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The Vehicle Inspectorate could perhaps check newly-installed seat belts. I believe that that is done only rarely. Will the Minister reassure the Committee that the retro-fitted seat belts will be checked as part of the MOT process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to give one example of how difficult it will be for schools and transport operators to ensure that they are using reputable, quality firms to install belts. The firm that I have in mind used advertisements asserting that its retro-fitted seat belts had been tested by the Motor Industry Research Association. That was right; they had been tested, but it was not disclosed that they had failed the test. False advertising can have fatal consequences. We must do something to stop such blatant breaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also received reports about another fitter, who provided seat belts for three local education authorities. He fitted belts to seats that were not strong enough to survive a collision. The backs of the seats could collapse, causing horrific injuries. In another case, seat belts were fixed to seats that were not adequately attached to the floor. When the campaign for the fitting of seat belts started, the Government's correct objection was that many vehicles were not designed for that purpose and that the seats and floors of some vehicles were not strong enough to hold a child or an adult should an impact occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a special concern about retro-fitting in older minibuses. Such vehicles were never designed for seat belts and it is notable that many manufacturers will refuse to fit seat belts to their own vehicles that were built before 1988. They have convincing evidence to show that the fitting of seat belts to such vehicles would have unsatisfactory results. The Minister, however, may have other ideas. We must ensure that the seat belts in vehicles used for carrying children are effective, and safe and that they function properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another concern is that a small minority of operators may attempt to avoid applying the regulations by switching to exempt vehicles, such as buses. They can do so by fitting speed regulators to limit vehicle speed to 60 mph, or by combining school transport activities with other service provision so that they qualify for exemption as an eligible bus service. We are all aware of the infinite deviousness of some operators in finding a way round regulations. Although such actions would be against the spirit of the regulations, they could result in children being unprotected because they would not be wearing seat belts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations also leave open a possible loophole—a small but growing class of vehicle that has more than 16 seats and is capable of travelling at more than 60 mph, but weighs under 7·5 tonnes. The condition of cars, their differing weights, differing ability to reach speed and different capacities may leave the regulations high and dry. At least one vehicle—a Volvo—may have been exempted by omission from the regulations. I do not suggest that the omission is deliberate, but if the loophole exists, will the Minister ensure that it is closed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
A stipulation is made about forward-facing seats. There are undoubtedly concerns about short-backed, rear-facing seats, which can cause serious neck injuries in a car crash. Although we appreciate that people prefer to face forward, it is widely recognised that the safest arrangement is a high-backed, rear-facing seat. It would provide the greatest protection in the most likely and most dangerous of accidents—a head-on collision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations should not prevent the use of high-backed, rear-facing seats because that would exclude potentially the safest form of design. I do not refer to the general run of minibuses because it would not be sensible to reduce their capacity by fitting such seats. However, in some specialist minibuses, such as those used for executive purposes, safety may be increased by having a smaller number of seats. Their cost may be a factor in preventing the fitting of such seats, but there is no reason to prohibit them. In some circumstances, such as when trying to fit seats into the small space of a minibus, operators wish to provide rear-facing seats and are willing to use the safe, high-backed model. I hope that the Minister will encourage that practice where it is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain the reason for choosing 1988 as the cut-off date up to which older vehicles were allowed extra time to fit belts. Presumably, the decision was made on grounds of safety and practicability. It has been suggested that that derogation was intended to prevent the invalidation of the warranty, for vehicles nearing the end of their 10-year warranty period, by the structural work necessary to fit the seat belts. Was that the reason for selecting the 10-year derogation period?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of three-for-two sharing of seats was taken up in the second part of the BUSK campaign. The Opposition strongly support the spirit of the regulations, but certain matters of concern arise. Some operators might want to avoid applying the regulations by using exempt vehicles, as I mentioned earlier. It is not only operators who might be tempted along that route. We have evidence that some local education authorities have asked an operator to switch from coaches to buses to allow the continuation of the three-for-two practice, to save money. It is well understood that if a second vehicle has to be booked because of the three-for-two rule change, costs will increase considerably. In most circumstances, that will not be necessary, but some local education authorities' costs will increase and they might attempt to find ways round the regulations. Even if that can be prevented, which seems unlikely, most children will still be carried under the old, less safe conditions, because the regulations have a limited application. The issue is important and I am sure that the Committee will be united in wanting to resolve it as soon as possible, to avoid accidents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some confusion has been caused by the start date of 1 May for the regulations. That date does not fit with the mass of contract periods, which are arranged either yearly, which seems to happen almost universally, or occasionally, termly. Rarely are contracts settled on
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
anything other than an annual basis, because they usually cover the academic year. Why was 1 May chosen?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is, no doubt, aware that the changes will have an effect on overall school transport provision. If school and other transport providers are to comply with the regulations, they will need more vehicles to deal with the same number of children that they are dealing with now. Inevitably, some services will be withdrawn. What is the Minister's view on the likelihood of increased traffic and pollution caused by the extra vehicles or, in areas where they might be withdrawn, on the necessity for parents to provide transport? Finally, will the Minister extend the regulations to Northern Ireland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.42 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pendle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must add a few brief words to those of my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn). I, too, welcome the regulations, but I wonder why they were not considered last year, the year before, or the year before that. I have been in correspondence with Ministers on the issue for a long time—since 1993—and I have always been led to believe that we could not act independently of the European Union on the matter. Yet regulations have been presented to us that rely, not on any European Community directive, but on our domestic legislation—the Road Traffic Act 1988. Why were such important changes, which will save lives, not made years ago?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not the only person to ask that question. Roy Colton, a constituent of mine who was disabled and is in a wheelchair, has been following these matters for many years. He is a regular correspondent with me and his name will be familiar to the Minister. Another constituent—Kevin Holden—has also been following these matters and it is right that I should mention him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are flawed in several respects. Seat belts, it seems, are not obligatory for backward-facing seats. Why? I looked at the 1986 regulations and that was the position then. That has been carried forward into the current regulations, unless I have misunderstood them. What happens if children travelling in a minibus decide to sit in backward-facing seats? They may choose not to sit in the forward-facing seats in which they would wear seat belts. That aspect of the regulations does not seem sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be nothing in the regulations to ensure that seat belts are actually used. We are talking about children in minibuses. Why is no duty or obligation imposed on the school or the driver of the vehicle to make sure that, when it is moving and carrying a complement of young people, the children have to belt up? The regulations seem to include only minibuses and coaches. Inexplicably, they exclude double deckers. I do not know how many school double deckers there are, but they exist. There will be no protection for school children travelling in school double deckers, rather than double deckers that double up—if I can put it like that—as transport for the general travelling public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
What is the position for parallel bench seats in minibuses? It may be covered by the regulations; if so, I have failed to pick it up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West also mentioned costs. From correspondence, I learned that the costs of fitting belts in 20,000 older minibuses will be about £6 million. I am told that that figure is reflected in the local authority grant settlement. I want to press the Minister on whether the money is ring-fenced in that settlement, or is in the general pool and it is at the discretion of councils whether to spend it on fitting seatbelts, strengthening floors or what have you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want clarification on the costs of converting minibuses. I dug the compliance cost assessment out of the Library and it says that there will be a one-off cost of £6 million for the 20,000 vehicles to be converted, at a typical cost of £300 each, inclusive of VAT. I am no expert, but I should have thought that £300 was a modest sum, especially for older vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not the only person who thinks that sum modest; I pray in aid academics from Manchester Metropolitan university who have set up a separate company, the Minibus Safety Programme, which sells their expertise to people who want to convert minibuses to make them safe. That is a marvellous initiative that the Minister will appreciate as much as I do, but a leaflet from those experts—not lay people like me—suggests the projected costs of kit and fitting for, say, a Ford Transit as £3,000 plus VAT at the top of the range. We are not talking just about new seats and seat belts, but about anchorages, a new flooring system and all the other paraphernalia that goes with repairs. I should like the Minister to reflect on that and to let me know whether he thinks the figure in the compliance cost assessment is on the modest side, given what Mr. Julian Stow from Manchester Metropolitan university tells me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was very concerned to find that the regulations offer no comfort for people in wheelchairs. Only the able bodied, travelling in front-facing seats, will get a degree of protection; it is not for people in wheelchairs. The technology is there, however. Tie downs exist to anchor wheelchairs to the floor of a minibus. I am sure that the Minister made no oversight; why did he choose deliberately to ignore the obvious problems of people in wheelchairs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why were diagonal seat belts not specified? Any amount of research shows that lap seat belts can cause severe abdominal injuries. The seat belt that does the trick of saving lives—or has a higher chance of saving lives—is the diagonal seat belt. I should like to press the Minister on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of Transport sent a note to the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments a month ago on these regulations. The note tells us that when seat belts are installed in older vehicles they
	<br><blockquote><p>"would have to meet specified marking requirements and be secured to anchorages which meet certain technical requirements".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
That statement is hot off the Department of Transport presses, dated 27 February 1996. Will the Minister tell us whether EC laws on anchorages have or have not been fully called into our own domestic legislation? Do the regulations refer only to technical and installation requirements on older vehicles, and not the loads test to see what force is needed for the seat belts to fail to do the job they were designed for? If so, I consider that a serious problem. New vehicles have to comply with technical and installation requirements and must also apply the loads test. Older, possibly clapped-out buses that are being converted under the regulations have to adhere to the technical specifications but not the loads test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I spoke to Mr. Julian Stow and the others, I asked how many small firms are in the business of converting minibuses that might be used by schools and was told that there are about 60 or 70 nationwide. What kind of licensing and inspection arrangements are in place—as my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West has already asked—to ensure that the work of those firms is not slipshod? I do not know what percentage of minibuses on the road falls into the category of older vehicles, but I suspect it must be close to 50 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter has dragged on for far too long. It was given added urgency in my constituency in May 1994 when a tragic accident happened in North Yorkshire, just over the border from Pendle, in which two cub scouts lost their lives. They were members of the pack in Crosshills, so the issue is tremendously salient to my area and to many others. Such matters deserve to be dealt with seriously. I expect that the Minister will want to reply today to all the points that I have made, and people will be interested to hear what he says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to refer to the regulations on the carrying capacity of public vehicles. I understand that it is lawful for buses to carry standing passengers even when they are speeding along the motorway. Will the Minister confirm that? If buses can career along motorways while carrying standing passengers, is the Minister minded to do anything about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Minister for Transport in London (Mr. Steve Norris)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friends for their patience and eternal good humour. I shall seek not to detain them for too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the points raised by Opposition Members, and I welcome their warm welcome for the regulations. The hon. Member for Newport, West was infinitely better organised than his hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen), who generally manages to speak for an hour on such issues, but seldom shows any sign that he has the intellectual grasp of the issues that the hon. Member for Newport, West has shown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Newport, West and for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) asked some pertinent questions. Although we try to get through such Committees as quickly as we can, important issues have been raised, not least those that relate to the installation of seat belts in older vehicles. The issue of certified installers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0619">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

was raised, but there is no scheme for the certification of installers; nor do we propose to introduce one. However, let me make it clear that for vehicles first registered after 1968 the standards in the new regulations will relate to those in the existing construction and use standards. Therefore, in general, that will not cause installers any difficulty. Most of the later coaches will have been built to a standard that readily allows them to be retro-fitted if they do not have seat belts already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newport, West asked about the relevance of the 1988 cut-off date. From 1988, there has been an obligation to fit seat belts to exposed seats on coaches. That generally means the centre seat at the rear and the seats at the front that do not have a seat squab in front of them. Before these regulations were introduced, it was felt that the seat squab in front of the passenger was the sort of protection that is conveniently afforded by a seat belt. The cut-off date of 1988 was chosen for that reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newport, West was also right to state that we must treat seriously the problem of ensuring that we have adequate standards of fitment on much older vehicles. On a coach of that age, it is difficult to ensure not only that the belt is properly fitted, but that it is fitted to metal that retains sufficient strength to ensure that the anchorage is sound and that the structure of the bus is such that it will adequately take a seat belt. We have always approached the matter on an entirely bipartisan basis, but there is not an easy answer. There will be, as there is at present, a check on the seat belt fitting by the Vehicle Inspectorate at the time of the annual test. The test will be the same kind that is carried out on a passenger car's seat belts—to ensure that, where fitted, they function. Our approach has been to ensure that the standards that are set relate to existing construction and use regulations, and to make it clear that the installer must meet those standards. We cannot specify the precise arrangement for every type of coach—particularly for older vehicles. Incidentally, a 10-year old coach is by no means an old coach in industry terms. It is perhaps half way through its natural life. We should expect some coaches to date from before 1988. We shall set the standard and the installer will then be required to meet it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still discussing with my colleagues in the Vehicle Inspectorate and elsewhere whether we could build in additional safeguards. Those would undoubtedly impose costs and we should understand from the outset that none of the measures that are proposed will come without cost. I point outgently—to the opposition, that it is a bit rich to press for the regulations and then complain about the costs that they will impose, as if such improvements could be provided cost-free. They cannot. They must be financed by taxpayers or local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have misunderstood me. I tried—clearly unsuccessfully—to point out that the local authority grant settlement should reimburse the local authorities for the costs of fitting seat belts in their minibuses. I quoted the compliance cost assessment of £300 per vehicle. I also
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
quoted the figures from the Manchester Metropolitan university, and drew attention to the discrepancy. I balk not at the fact that money must be spent, but at the fact that local authorities may not have been fully reimbursed for the true cost of doing the necessary work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring both to the hon. Gentleman's comments and those of the hon. Member for Newport, West about the possible need for more coaches because of the abandonment of the three-fortwo rule. Local authorities will have to find that cost after being reimbursed through the rate support grant system, as the hon. Gentleman suggested. The straight answer to his question is that the allocation between the departments is not ring-fenced. It is for the authorities to determine how they use the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue impinges on several important questions that the hon. Member for Newport, West raised. Ordinary buses are excluded from the regulations. Buses' general characteristics are that they travel shorter distances, at slower speeds and accommodate standees—people who are legally allowed to stand. In trying to define a school bus, one is dealing with a particular species of double decker. Given the impracticability of defining a school bus, there are fairly obvious reasons for not including buses in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that some local authorities might—in my view misguidedly—choose to make savings by substituting buses for coaches fitted with seat belts, to achieve what might, spuriously, be seen as a saving to the authority. That must be a matter for each local authority, but I should hope that parents and head teachers would press local authorities to discharge their duties as they should—in the interests of children's safety. My views are clear. We have made the appropriate provision before the rest of the European Community. That answers the extraordinary suggestion made by the hon. Member for Pendle that somehow this country is late in doing it. We were the first European Community country to achieve this result and the first to do so in advance of general EC legislation. Introducing the proposals in the short time that we have is a singular achievement for the Government—something that even a critic as curmudgeonly and ungracious as the hon. Gentleman should not deny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fitting seat belts in minibuses that have the specialised function of transporting children has nothing to do with European competition policy. The idea that a European country could make a contract with a local school here to ferry children around beggars belief. Spain has been fitting seat belts to school minibuses—something that we are about to do. My complaint was that we could have done this three years ago. We were not held up by the European

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Union. What we are doing today could have been done in 1993. Perhaps the Minister will tell me if I am wrong about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong about that. As I have the advantage of having been at the Department of Transport since a man with a red flag ran in front of a vehicle, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I have followed this matter since before 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman ought to know—it is fairly elementary—that the regulations are governed by construction and use directives which, at present, do not specify the fitting of seat belts. Therefore, if the British Government had introduced a specification that legally required seat belts to be fitted, any manufacturer who sought not to abide by that law would have been able to rely on the defence that he was indeed fitting his vehicle to the standards required by the Euopean Community—a principle with which I wholly agree because it is important that we manufacture goods here and sell them with impunity in every market in the European Union—and would have been able to avoid prosection. In other words, the impact would have been entirely nugatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was necessary to obtain the European Union's consent to introducing regulations in advance of the European directive requirement on the fitting of seat belts to all coaches, to allow us to deal with the specific matter of transporting school children. That negotiation was close fought and fought with some assiduity by my predecessor road safety Ministers and by myself. I am, therefore, delighted to record that the United Kingdom is introducing the regulations in advance of the rest of the European Community. This reflects the fact that we have always been much more concerned with road safety matters than some of our Community partners, as the hon. Gentleman knows from other aspects of road safety. Let us hear no more of that curmudgeonly and ungracious nonsense about this country somehow not acting fast enough. One of the great luxuries of being in opposition is claiming, if a Government get it right, that it should have been done earlier. If Opposition Members have learnt anything in the past 17 years, it ought to have been how to oppose with some competence—a skill that I hope they will continue to refine for many years to come. Until the hon. Member for Pendle intervened in that uncharitable way, a number of serious points were being made by his hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One rule is worth bearing in mind—the seat belt must not break from the seat before the seat breaks from the floor. There is a cardinal principle at issue here. The seat belt with its fittings must be sufficiently strong to ensure that it at least withstands the sort of accident that would leave the seat secure. There would be real risks with a fitment that was not adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
A number of questions were raised on seat design. First, on fitting crew seats, I should make it clear that it is impossible to restrain people safely in those sorts of seats, so they will be banned from carrying school children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On rear-facing seats, there is a difficulty; certain types can cause problems. It has proved extremely difficult to find a suitable technical standard for rear-facing seats in terms of the strength of the seat back and other considerations. I am not opposed in principle to seat belts for children on rear-facing seats and would always advocate that they are fitted, but because of the difficulty in arriving at a satisfactory technical specification we have not been able to make a specification for those seats at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A reference was made to 1 May as the introduction date for the three-for-two rule. There was some interest in other dates. The Government's view, reinforced by consultation, was that the three-for-two concession should end as soon as possible. I think that the hon. Member for Newport, West would agree that that is sensible. The first round date after the Easter holidays was 1 May and it has been chosen for that reason. It allows some time for contract renegotiations, which may need to take place. To move to September—there have even been suggestions that we should leave it until the start of the next academic year—would have been, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will agree, too long a delay, given that we have the power to do what we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that collegues in Northern Ireland are considering the regulations with a view to bringing forward legislation for the Province in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two residual issues remain to be dealt with. First, the idea of a duty to ensure that belts are worn is very difficult. With the greatest respect to the hon. Member for Pendle—on second thoughts, I withdraw that as I was going to say that he was, with the greatest respect, wrong but in fact he simply was wrong, as he so often is. If he considers the practicality—something that Oppositions never have to do, but which we have to bear in mind—of laying a legal obligation on the driver of a coach to make sure that children sitting in that coach are wearing a seat belt, he will realise that it would make it extraordinarily difficult to recruit drivers. If he suggests that we lay that obligation on a class teacher, he would find it possible to find teachers willing to take any responsibility for the transport of children on coaches. If he lays it on parents, they will quite properly argue that they are not present and have no practical way to enforce the wearing of seat belts. For that reason, we have stopped short of imposing any legal obligation to any individual to ensure the wearing of seat belts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There remains, of course, a strong obligation on local authorities and schools to ensure that, as seat belts are fitted, they are used. We have made it clear that schools take their responsibilities seriously and frequently ensure that children are accompanied. One of the functions of an accompanying adult will be to ensure, by whatever means are available, that children wear seat belts. But to lay a legal obligation on an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0621">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
individual would be counter-productive. It would simply be impossible to recruit a teacher or anyone else to take on that responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Manchester Metropolitan university research appeared to be at variance with the compliance cost assessment. Without more detail on that research I should not want to comment on the apparent disparity, except to observe in passing that the compliance cost assessment makes it clear that it quotes a typical cost. I do not disagree that, in certain circumstances—particularly where a substantial amount of body rebuilding was needed to fix belts—the cost might be as high as the hon. Member for Pendle suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, questions may be asked about whether it is worth fitting seat belts on much older coaches. If that were to lead to some of the older coaches disappearing from the system, I doubt whether hon. Members from either side of the Committee would regret their passing. I do not want to dispute the figures of the hon. Member for Pendle, but I reinforce the fact that the requirement is to provide seat belts. However, it does not require them at a specified price. I know that operators recognise that the costs may be higher for older vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A code of practice exists for the carriage of school children in wheelchairs. The vast majority of those children are not carried on coaches for an obvious reason. Unless the coaches are specifically adapted, there is no place for a wheelchair. The rather odd suggestion made by the hon. Member for Pendle was blown out of the water as soon as he made it. Special provision will continue to be made for such children and that will be done according to the existing code of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the great delight of my hon. Friends, I propose to finish on the last point made by the hon. Member for Pendle. He referred to diagonal belts and, by that, I take it he means three-point belts as opposed to lap belts. The regulations require the fitting of belts, and those belts may be lap belts. Because of the design of some coaches, lap belts are the only type that it is practicable to fit. However, some operators have been able to overcome the technical difficulties and they fit three-point belts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A serious point is at issue and I crave my colleagues' indulgence to allow me to spend one minute to spell it out. The dangerous proposition has been advanced that it would somehow be better to have no belt than to have a lap belt. The hon. Member for Pendle referred to the risk of severe abdominal injury from a lap belt. He is entirely right, and he should know that three-point belts can cause severe intestinal and abdominal damage themselves. A member of my family narrowly escaped death and suffered a cracked rig cage and substantial internal injuries as a result of wearing a three-point belt. None the less, happily, he is alive. If he had not been wearing the belt, he would, without a shadow of doubt, have died instantly. Although it is an unqualified truth that a three-point belt is better than a lap belt and that a four-point belt, such as used in some aviation contexts, is better than a three-point belt, a lap belt is better than none at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Given that a huge number of coaches cannot satisfactorily be converted to three-point belts, it is important to establish a practicable regulation that is a substantial advance in terms of road safety. I know that the hon. Member for Pendle recognises that, but if any parents were to have the idea—I have heard of terribly well-meaning and earnest parents who argue this—that no belt is better than a lap belt, they are severley mistaken. I hope that if any of them read our proceedings, they will take that point heavily on board. The requirement is for a lap belt and it is true that a three-point belt is better. However, a lap belt is substantially better than no belt at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt with all the points that Opposition Members have raised. I am grateful to them for doing so because it is a serious subject. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the spirit in which the Minister replied. However, he was off beam on a number of issues. I did not suggest—and do not think that 
	<i>Hansard</i> will show that I suggested—that wearing no seat belt was preferable to wearing a lap belt. It is an incontrovertible fact—confirmed by the Minister a few moments ago—that a diagonal belt, which he termed a three-point belt, is safer than a lap belt. In those circumstances, I should have thought it sensible for the regulations to stipulate that where possible minibuses should be fitted with three-point belts, not two-point belts.

I have had no answer to the question that I posed at the end about S.I. No. 167 on whether, legally, buses can carry standing passengers when zooming along a motorway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. The hon. Gentleman is quite right that I neglected to answer that point. In common sense terms, what differentiates a bus from a coach—and I do not want this to be taken as an all-time, comprehensive definition of a bus—is the ability of a bus to carry standee passengers. It is highly unusual for buses to travel at high speed. They are almost certainly regulated to lower speeds by their operators and it is almost unknown for them to do what the hon. Gentleman suggests, which is travel at speed with standees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will allow me to write to him to confirm the precise legal position on standees on motorways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one final point. I am glad that the Minister was able to clear up confusion about whether the regulations could have been brought before us a year or two ago. I notice that they rely entirely on British domestic law, including the Road Traffic Act 1988, and specifically exclude EC legislation. I thought that the position of our colleagues in the European Union was that if the British Government were minded to bring in regulations for safety reasons that were not being done in any anti-competitive spirit, the other countries in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

the EU would not baulk. The Minister does not accept that interpretation, and I am happy to accept what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his answers and accept what he has said. We realise the practical difficulties of grafting on to vehicles that were not designed to have seat belts an entirely new standard that we all think necessary. If the regulations are to be effective, I hope that the Minister will make sure that great publicity is put out to parents and local authorities to ensure their co-operation in persuading children to keep an eye on the standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle, I am concerned about the cost. I do not think £300 is a practical amount, particularly as there will be additional costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I remind the Minister that we are not perpetually in opposition. For many years, I chaired a transport committee in Gwent and dealt with
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
problems on a day-to-day basis. I am aware of the difficulties. We made special arrangements for children in wheelchairs. I am grateful for the Minister's bipartisan approach. In the very near future, when we are on the Government side of the Committee, we shall deal with these matters as enthusiastically as he will during the last remaining months of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
