	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Jeremy Hanley)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Representation if the People (Northern Ireland) (Variation of Specified Documents and Amendment) Regulations 1991.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee it will be convenient to consider at the same time the other two instruments, namely, the draft European Parliamentary Elections (Northern Ireland) (Amendment) Regulations 1991 and the draft Local Elections (Northern Ireland) (Amendment) Order 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regulations and order are partly the consequences of changes made to the law on absent voting by the Representation of the People Act 1990. They also introduce other minor changes that will affect elections in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister of State for Northern Ireland hoped to move the regulations. Regrettably, he has suffered a bereavement and is attending a funeral in Belfast today. I am sure that the Committee wishes him well in his sad hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, people in Northern Ireland who move house to another ward and who cannot reasonably be expected to return to vote in person at the polling station allotted to them on the basis of their qualifying address, may apply for an absent vote each time that there is an election. The Representation of the People Act 1990 provides that, in future, people who move house to another ward will have to make just one application for all elections. That will ensure that they have an absent vote at all elections until their names appear on the electoral register at their new address. The change reduces the work of the chief electoral officer for Northern Ireland and, more importantly, removes an unnecessary burden from the electorate. The 1990 Act received all-party support in the House and in another place and the regulations and draft Order in Council make changes that have already been approved by Parliament for England, Wales and Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations add the new style plastic national insurance number card to the list of specified documents. A specified document must be produced in Northern Ireland before electors can be issued with a ballot paper. The present list of specified documents includes a current passport, driving licence, allowance, pension or benefit payment book,
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
medical card, merchant seaman's card and, in certain circumstances, a recent marriage certificate. The system of specified documents was introduced by the Elections (Northern Ireland) Act 1985 after the systematic personation of electors in Northern Ireland. The requirement to produce a specified document applies at all elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, the new system has generally worked well. During the passage of the Elections (Northern Ireland) Bill, however, the Government undertook to keep the list of specified documents under review, and minor changes have already been made to the original list. We have examined the list again, and we recently concluded that it would be helpful, especially for young electors, to add the new style national insurance number card to the list of specified documents. The card replaced the old manilla one in January 1984. It is issued automatically when persons reach the age of 16. Consequently, most 18 to 23-year-olds in Northern Ireland already have one, and the addition of the card will afford younger voters a wider range of documents for use at elections and, it is hoped, encourage them to vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Representation of the People (Amendment) regulations also take the opportunity to make a minor amendment to the law consequential on a change made by the 1989 amendment regulations. Those regulations provided that candidates in local elections were entitled to a free copy of that part of the electoral register that covered the district electoral area for which they stood for election. The present amendment regulations will clarify that candidates will also be entitled to computerised data and addressed labels for the same parts of the electoral register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the draft Local Elections Order in Council increases the maximum level of candidates' expenses at local elections in Northern Ireland. The last increase was made in 1989, and the new maximum levels reflect corresponding increases made in respect of candidates at local elections in Great Britain by the Representation of the People (Variation of Limits of Candidates Election Expenses) Order 1991, which has already been before the House and came into force on 8 April 1991.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minor amendments to the law improve the voting system for the electorate. They include no additional penalties and impose no difficulties on individual voters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
