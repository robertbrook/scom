	<p>
	<i>[Relevant Documents: European Community Document No. 10948/99, Commission report on the appreciation of the Community rules for state aid to the coal industry in 1996 and 1997]</i></p>

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe (Mrs. Helen Liddell)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to appear before the Committee on an important subject that is particularly relevant, given the difficulties being experienced by the British coal industry. I shall go through the questions asked by the European Scrutiny Committee in order to provide greater detail than was included in the explanatory memorandum that was submitted to it last autumn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put the matter in context, since 1964 the European Coal and Steel Community has defined successive aid codes to ensure that member states' aid to the coal and steel industries is compatible with the rules on aid and subsidies in the ECSC treaty. Aid to the coal and steel industry can be granted only through that treaty; it cannot come from other sources such as regional development assistance. The treaty was designed for the coal and steel industries when they were high-growth strategic industries, but as everyone knows, since the 1960s the prospects for and the nature of those industries have changed considerably. Regrettably, since that time the state aid rules have had to be tailored to the management of an industry in decline. Coal state aid is currently governed by the ECSC coal state aid code, as set out in decision 3632 of 1993. That code is the subject of the report from the Commission on the application of coal state aid rules for the years 1996 and 1997, which was considered by the European Scrutiny Committee. The decision, which can be amended only by unanimous agreement, expires in 2002, along with the ECSC treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the current coal state aid rules, it was decided that some of the objectives contained in previous coal state aid decisions were no longer valid arguments for paying state aid. As the world coal market was stable, with abundant supplies from a wide variety of geographical sources, it was agreed that the security of supply argument that had previously applied to ECSC aid was no longer sufficient justification for maintaining unprofitable indigenous capacity. In addition, the unfavourable geological conditions in European coalfields virtually precluded the creation of new economically viable capacity. Consequently, decision 3632 of 1993 provides only for
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
residual operating aid, conditional on further progress being made towards economic viability, in the light of coal prices on international markets and with the aim of reducing aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have always believed that that should imply that the mines or undertakings receiving the aid must have a hope of achieving a degree of competitiveness against imported coal in the long term, although a recent judgment of the European Court of Justice indicated that the critical issue was not whether viability was possible, but whether significant cuts in production costs were being made. That is a vital distinction. It was not about whether viability was possible, but whether there had been significant cuts in production costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Commission has recognised that the United Kingdom is the only country in the European Union that is now close to operating a competitive coal industry. United Kingdom coal is produced at costs that are roughly a third of German production costs and a quarter or less of Spanish costs. It receives no operating aid and that, along with the fact that it is wholly privatised, distinguishes it from the majority of coal that is produced elsewhere in Europe. That is a particularly impressive record, but it is to the credit of British miners that they have achieved levels of competitiveness that are so far beyond anything that has been achieved elsewhere in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it is up to the industry to introduce the cost savings that are necessary to remain competitive, the Government works closely with the Commission to address the issues of aid to the coal industry in the longer term when it distorts competition. That is consistent with the liberalised energy market that we wish to develop in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the European Union. The Government are particularly concerned to avoid situations in other member states in which operating aid is paid to undertakings that have no prospect of being competitive internationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report from the Commission makes clear that, with the exception of the United Kingdom, there is no prospect of the coal industry in the rest of the Community competing on the international market. It concludes that the state aid given to coal production has not provided an answer to the structural crisis that faces the industry. That is because the seams have become less productive, but it is also due to the absence of competitive pressure. The European Scrutiny Committee has rightly asked me whether I agree with those conclusions and, if so, whether I am satisfied that the Community's policy of phasing out state aid to the industry is being correctly implemented at a satisfactory pace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully agree with the Commission's conclusions, it is unsatisfactory that, in certain countries, unprofitable capacity, which, in some cases, has production costs that are five times world market rates, has been kept in operation while, in the United Kingdom, the industry
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0857">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
has managed to achieve levels of competitiveness that are so far beyond anything achieved elsewhere in Europe. That cannot be fair and that unsatisfactory outcome is due to the lack of a genuine Community approach to restructuring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As shown in the Commission's report, operating aid in member states has risen from 28.1 ecu per tonne in 1992 to 48.4 ecu per tonne in 1997. I share the industry's frustration when it looks across the channel and sees huge subsidies going into German, Spanish and French coal industries. It must be recognised, however, that the United Kingdom coal industry is not competing directly with ECSC-subsidised coal. The main losers in that area are the German, Spanish and French taxpayers, who have to subsidise industries that have no realistic chance of being competitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since we came to office in 1997, we have had some success in pressing the Commission to apply the coal state aid rules strictly. Following a complaint by Celtic Energy in Wales, the Government complained to the Commission in 1997 about the unfair practices of two subsidised German anthracite producers. On 29 July 1998, after a prolonged investigation, the Commission requested repayment of aid by the German companies involved. The companies have since withdrawn from the Untied Kingdom market and the Commission's decision should provide United Kingdom producers with an assurance that unfair practices will not occur in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Scrutiny Committee also asked me whether the Government support only the complaints of individual companies. That is not the case. We have been pro-active in taking up several issues that could affect the competitiveness of the United Kingdom industry. In the case of Spain, we complained formally to the European Commission about the discriminatory application of limits on the sulphur content of coal from different ECSC resources and we have received assurances that Untied Kingdom coal will be treated on the same basis as Spanish coal. We have also laid a formal complaint against Spanish state aid for coal, questioning whether the criteria have been fulfilled for all producers receiving operating aid under the ECSC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I am sorry to interrupt the Minister's smooth flow of information, but could you give me some guidance? My understanding was that questions in this Committee were normally prefaced by a short ministerial statement. What does "short" mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The word "short" means about 10 minutes in this instance, and we are not there yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I am aware of the pressures on the Committee, which is why I sought clarification before making my opening remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
In reply to points made in the European Scrutiny Committee, we made representations in March 1998 about the proposed merger of the three remaining hard coal producers, in which we set out our view that their privatisation at DM1 represented significant unauthorised aid for German production. That example and others show that we take on specific issues, as well as supporting our coal industry in its criticisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also watched closely the progress of RJB Mining's challenge to the Commission's decision on German state aid. In our meetings with the Commission, we have put many of the same arguments as RJB. The recent interim judgement by the European Court of First Instance was not in RJB's favour, but it was not a total disappointment, because it dismissed many of the arguments made by the Commission's lawyers to justify the authorisation of operating aid to pits that have never been economically viable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We now have until 11.30 am for questions. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and asked one at a time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One thing in the Minister's statement intrigued me. Can she throw any light on the reason why we are only now, in this Parliament—in the second month of 2000—discussing matters that arose in 1996 and 1997? Has the Minister probed the Commission on why it has taken so long to produce the documents before us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather more interested in the content of the report than in the date of publication. However, the fact that such reports come to our attention much too slowly creates a difficulty. That is one reason why we support the Vice-President of the Commission, Neil Kinnock, in his proposals for reform of European Community administration and structures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Trickett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that we were not competing directly with coal producers elsewhere in the ECSC. That may be strictly true, but it is not the purpose of subsidy in Germany and elsewhere to reduce the cost of coal to the price of coal on the international market? Is it not also true that our coal industry, which has the lowest production costs and no subsidy, is thereby losing out on the market, which has resulted in the current closures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point, which underpins what I said in my introduction. Overall, the operation of state aid in countries such as Germany meets neither the spirit of the ECSC's 1993 decision nor the decision itself, which is aimed at ensuring that production costs are reduced over time. Indeed, the Community will have to deal with that when we start to discuss the successor regime to the European Coal and Steel Community treaty. That must be done by 2002 and is the reason behind several actions in relation to state aid to the coal industry in Germany.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind the impending closure of Ellington colliery in a few weeks, has the Department made any approach, formal or informal, to the Commission to ascertain whether any state aid scheme would comply with the new rules, and be of assistance at Ellington?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proprietor of Ellington colliery has not made a case to us for the use of state aid there. However, we have had numerous discussions with the industry and the Commission on the state of the coal industry, particularly that in England, as distinct from that in the United Kingdom. Those discussions are continuing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help the Committee if I outline again some of the issues relating to coal industry aid. Operating aid can be paid only if there is evidence that production costs could be reduced. As I understand it, when RJB Mining issued the closure notice, it made it clear that Ellington had geological difficulties, which meant that the ambition of reducing production costs could not be achieved. Notwithstanding the difficulties with operating aid, we continue to consider ways in which we can assist the industry. Currently, the proposals that have been put to me relate only to the industry in England in general, and I have no proposals for specific pits. However, we cannot give operating aid to areas with geological difficulties. Only closure aid is available to those areas, and that has not been requested for Ellington.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Murphy 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wansbeck)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, the Minister did not have time during her statement to touch on the problems with imported fuel. I understand that we import more than 20 million tonnes per annum. Evidence is mounting that some of that coal has been dumped here. What action do the Government intend to take?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, who has considerable knowledge of these matters, has raised an important point. I will put the issue of imported coal into context. This is a European Standing Committee, so I have concentrated on European Union countries that operate state aid regimes. It is important, however, to bear in mind the fact that imported coal, which accounts for roughly 20 per cent. of total coal usage, comes mostly from Australia, Canada, Colombia, Poland, South Africa and the United States. From previous discussions, I know of my hon. Friend's concerns about imported Polish coal. The Government share his anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Minister for Trade has raised with the European Commission the industry's complaint about the dumping of Polish coal. We are putting as much pressure on the Commission as we can on that matter. My right hon. Friend has also discussed Polish coal with his counterparts in other trade Ministries. I am glad to say that it appears that Polish industrial coal is now being withdrawn from the United Kingdom industry. Of course, our industry launched an anti-dumping complaint last week about
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
the alleged dumping of house coal from Poland. The subject is very live and very important, and we will pursue it as vigorously as our powers allow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister read the Commission's conclusions, which are astonishingly damning about the prospects for the European coal industry, did she take the view that they were helpful for the United Kingdom coal industry? Did she think that the report would allow her to up the ante with the Commission in her defence of the United Kingdom coal industry and her criticisms of the subsidies in other member states? Or did she decide that there was nothing new in the report, and that the Government's approach should remain unchanged?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The report covers a period during which this Government were not in office. It was useful for those of us who came into government in 1997 because it gave a global view of the operation of the coal industry in the European Community and in international markets. Although we are discussing only European Coal and Steel Community aid to the coal industry, the Government have been concerned about the coal industry in general, notwithstanding the significant achievements that the work force and management in the industry have made in reducing the costs of British coal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view when we were elected, confirmed by our energy report, was that there was not a level playing field for the United Kingdom coal industry in the energy markets in this country. For that reason, over and above our relationships with the European Community, we have introduced a stricter gas consents policy, which has safeguarded a coal burn of 10 million tonnes since its implementation. In itself, that has helped to guarantee a more level playing field for coal, and we will underpin that with the new electricity trading arrangements, which are aimed at ensuring the fairer operation of energy markets and ending the discrimination against coal. We must put the challenges that the British coal industry has faced as a consequence of international prices for coal against the huge improvement in its competitiveness, and match those challenges with the introduction of the stricter gas contents policy to safeguard coal burn at power stations in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clapham 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made the point about production costs. As she is aware, since 1994, costs in the industry have been reduced significantly, from about £1.50 per gigajoule to between £1.15 and £1.20 per gigajoule. A recent report by CLG Consultants suggested that, unless swift action is taken, two thirds of the coal mining industry could be lost by 2001. Given that scenario, is it now opportune for the Minister to explore with the European Commission whether aid could be made available to the United Kingdom coal mining industry to put it on the same
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0859">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
footing as the industries in Germany, Spain and France?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has much more knowledge and experience of the coal industry than many members of the Committee. I bow to his knowledge and experience, but the report to which he refers did not give a truly complete picture of the situation in the coal industry. Indeed, it could be quite damaging to the industry if it failed to underpin the huge improvement in competitiveness that has been achieved by the United Kingdom coal industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not underestimate the difficulties of the coal industry. That is why my officials and I have been discussing the matter for some time, and have repeatly taken legal advice on our opportunities for giving more assistance to the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are just two routes by which we can do that. One is by operating aid, which we have discussed, and for which there must be a reduction in production costs. Of course, there have already been significant reductions in production costs in the UK deep-mined coal industry, making it difficult to reduce those costs further. The alternative, which my hon. Friend and I have discussed on many occasions, is closure aid. For closure aid to be available, the industry would have to set a date for closure, which, as we understand it, would probably have to be before 2002.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend, his colleagues and many people in mining communities are not enthusiastic about our pursuing the closure aid option—I am not enthusiastic about it. However, if the industry wants it, we will certainly do what we can. We encounter significant difficulties with operating aid, but, as my hon. Friend knows, we continue to look for opportunities to be of assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take my answer one stage further, there would be another difficulty, even if we assume that we can find a legally robust way of paying operating aid: the aid would have to be non-discriminatory. In seeking to assist the deep-mined coal industry, we could find that we have to subsidise the opencast mining industry to avoid leaving ourselves open to challenge; the related legal issues are complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will recognise that I am trying to find a way forward on the difficulties that the coal industry is experiencing. It has not been easy to find clear-cut ways forward; rather it has been intensely frustrating. To date, we have not found a way to go beyond the stricter gas consents policy and the other measures on overall regional policy for coal mining communities that the Government have introduced. However, I shall not give up trying to find one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Miss Anne McIntosh 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise to the Committee for being late; I had a prior appointment, which I could not break.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
I thank the Minister for her answers. Does she not agree, however that the Government's policy in response to the Commission report fails to address the structural crisis in the coal industry, and that—even worse—we will continue to damage Britain's competitive position in the coal industry? What part do environmental requirements, as distinct from the competition aspect, play in the Government's approach?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's question is a bit rich, given that many of the issues confronting the coal industry at the moment are a direct consequence of the vendetta pursued against it and coal communities by the Government whom she supported.

The European Scrutiny Committee's final question also made the point about the environment. The question of sulphur emissions is important, and it is true that English deep-mined coal has quite high levels of sulphur. This is not an insuperable difficulty in itself, because sulphur emissions can be dealt with at the power station by fitting flue gas desulphurisation—FGD—equipment. The Environment Agency has adopted a new approach to the allocation of sulphur limits that encourages the fitting of such equipment. If it goes as planned, there is no reason why sulphur emissions limits should have a negative impact on how much United Kingdom coal can be burned. Therefore, although we recognise that sulphur emissions are an issue, that cannot be used to depress coal burn of United Kingdom coal any further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend mentioned that the competitiveness in the industry and said how good the British pits were. Nobody would deny that. However, our competitors in Europe are being kept alive by subsidies while our pits are closing. RJB is not going to subsidise those pits; Ellington colliery, into which it has refused to put any money at all, is a good example. RJB is buying pits abroad—in Indonesia and Australia and other places—so it clearly does not have the interest of British coalfields at heart. I am worried that by the time the subsidy stops, in 2002, all our pits will be out but, because of the subsidy, the uncompetitive pits in Europe will be standing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a point with which the Government agree. We should challenge unfair subsidies, particularly in Germany, Spain and France. We have been challenging them and will continue to do so. However, we must look ahead to the regime as it will be, post 2002, to ensure that the industry in countries that are not as competitive as the United Kingdom does not continue to receive unfair subsidies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given what is happening to international coal prices, we cannot take the pressure off the industry in the United Kingdom as regards improved production costs and reduced costs generally, particularly for deep-mined coal. That will require continuing and

sustained investment in the coal mines that have a geologically sustainable future. Everybody knows that there will be areas in the coal industry in which geological difficulties are inevitable, and we can do nothing about that. However, we need to ensure that our industry continues to compete, while repeatedly challenging other member states that operate an unfair subsidy regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question is in connection with Celtic Energy, which the Minister has mentioned. In paragraph 5.1 of the Commission report, under the heading "Complaints", it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission monitors very closely the influence State aid can have on the proper functioning of the Community market in coal".</p></blockquote>
The report says that the Commission came to a decision on 29 July 1998 about a complaint lodged in October 1996. First, as the Commission was supposed to be monitoring the situation so closely, was the Minister surprised to find that a formal complaint was required to trigger activity? Secondly, has she asked why it took so long for the matter to be resolved? Thirdly, in the light of here earlier comments, is the Commission now paying greater attention to what is going on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I asked hon. Members to ask questions one at a time, and by his own admission the right hon. Gentleman has asked three.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman's remarks suggest that we are on a time management course rather than in Committee with an opportunity to discuss issues concerning people who live in coal communities. They are following this debate and want us to take matters very seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the complaint made by the Welsh anthracite producer Celtic Energy, the Government complained to the Commission in 1997 about the unfair practices of two subsidised German anthracite producers. There was a prolonged investigation, which took into account all the issues involved—there is no point in making snap judgments. On 29 July, the Commission requested repayment of aid by the German companies, and those companies have withdrawn from the UK market. The Commission's decision should reassure UK producers that such unfair practices will not occur in future. Despite the success in relation to Celtic Energy, we will continue to monitor the situation closely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grogan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Selby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be some confusion about how much state aid might legally be payable to British mining. The Minister referred to closure aid not being payable after 2003, whereas the Commission decision states that it can be paid after 2003 if it is justified on exceptional social or regional grounds. Given that confusion, does she accept an invitation from all-party coalfield communities group to send her officials, with the group's officers, to meet
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
officials at the Commission to establish once and for all what might be legally payable to the British coal industry should such an application be made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My officials spend a good deal of time talking to officials in the European Commission, although sometimes we receive different messages from those who have gone independently. Notwithstanding that, we have taken repeated legal advice on our options in making a legally robust case for aid. That does not detract from my earlier point that such aid must be non-discriminatory and that we must be careful not to open ourselves to challenge for favouring deep-minded coal as against opencast coal, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my hon. Friends have had discussions with a junior official of the Commission on the issue of degression—that is an example of the gobbledegook used. For operating aid to be paid, the Commission must decide that it will degress—in other words, reduce—from a set level. The previous Government stopped paying operating aid in 1994, which has created for us the difficulty of how to degress from zero. I understand from discussions that some of my hon. Friends and representatives of the coal communities have had with the Commission that it was suggested that United Kingdom degression did not have to be taken into account, and that it might be possible to degress from the European level of aid. We are taking legal advice on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regardless of which corner we turn, we come back to the fact that operating aid must lead to a reduction in production costs. That is the difficulty that we have repeatedly found. We would need to see proposals on specific pits that showed how a reduction in production costs could be achieved. It is important to take those issues into account. I shall continue to take legal advice, although some of the messages that come from the Commission, often by word of mouth, are different from those that we are given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not receive a satisfactory answer to my first question, which was simply this: when the Minister read the report, which is severely damning about the state of the European coal industry and about subsidies, did the Government change their policy towards the European Commission? Has it given them an opportunity to do so? As her answer, she précised the energy White Paper—which we did not need, as we have all read it. I want to know what the report, published in September 1999 by the Commission, led the Government to do. Did they continue the same approach to the European Commission or did they change it—or does she not know the answer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman paid attention occasionally, he might get a grasp of the debate. In my first answer to the question set by the European Scrutiny Committee, I made it clear that I agreed with the Commission's report in relation to state aids. We have therefore continued with that policy. He asks
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0861">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
what my response was on reading the report. It was quite clear cut: absolute outrage at the complete failure of the previous Government properly to address the issues of the coal industry, and in a way that was vindictive and failed to take into account the fact that a properly constructed UK coal industry could be a significant generator of economic growth. He appears to forget that his Government were responsible for many of the difficulties with which we are faced today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yes, the Commission could operate much more quickly. That is one reason why the Vice-President of the Commission, Neil Kinnock, has tabled significant proposals that we, as a Government, support. If the hon. Gentleman were seriously concerned about the coal industry, he would be addressing the issues in the report—issues that were explored by the European Scrutiny Committee. Frankly, he and his hon. Friends seem not to be prepared to address those issues, preferring to worry about the timing of publication of documents. The people in the coalfields will see clearly who is concerned about the future of the coal industry in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At a recent hearing in the Court of First Instance, RJB Mining was unsuccessful in challenging unfair subsidies to the rest of the European coal producers. However, part of the judgment stated specifically that the matter was not the Commission's responsibility or decision to make, and that the decision not to apply subsidy was a political one by the UK Government. If the Minister disagrees with that, why have we not challenged that decision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before any member state applies for aid, the decision must be made by the Government. We have to be confident that any application for aid is legally robust, will deliver the claimed benefits to the industry and will not create more difficulties than it seeks to resolve. We found the response to the application by RJB Mining quite helpful in many instances, because it set out clearly that the activities of other member states were as unfair as we had always believed them to be. We keep a close watch on the case but continue to look for opportunities to help the industry in other ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was because of many such difficulties that the Government looked at the unfairness experienced by the whole industry and introduced the stricter gas consents policy. That has safeguarded a coal burn which has since turned out about 10 million tonnes. The policy is not an easy one; it has a heavy price in the loss of jobs in construction. Many hon. Members have complained about the operation of the policy, but it will remain in place until we have established a clearer and fairer market for the British coal industry and for the operation of our energy sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry came asking for fairness, not favours. We believe that we have delivered fairness. I am sure
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
that my hon. Friend will recognise that, as an energy Minister, I have to take into account the needs of all of the energy industries in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The report shows that alone among European industries the UK coal industry has a prospect of being competitive. Does that not show that the present international coal price is unsustainably low and, in itself, make the case that, for such a prospect to be satisfied, the industry may need some assistance for a limited period, while the international coal price settles at a more reasonable level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman and I have discussed the matter previously, and I accept what he says about the low price of coal. The international coal price will increase, but the Government do not believe that it will necessarily do so to the level that some industry operators would have us believe. Other extraneous issues affect coal burn and the demand for coal, not least the stormy weather in France over Christmas. That increased demand for coal burn in UK power stations, which export energy through the interconnector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Commission report was published, coal was about $27 a tonne. It is now moving towards $30 a tonne; but where the price will eventually settle is a matter for debate among industry analysts. We believe that it will recover, but I am not prepared to say at what level. Until all other market parameters are in place, we will not know the final settling point and hence the short-term international coal price.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clapham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard the Minister's reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck (Mr. Murphy). I know that my right hon. Friend is deeply committed to the local mining industry and that she is exploring every avenue. I draw attention to the submission made by RJB Mining to the Select Committee. RJB cited the judgment of the Court of First Instance, quoting a paragraph from it, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In response to the applicant's preliminary observations, the Commission submits, without being contradicted on that point, the applicant could for its part, have applied for State aid, but that the United Kingdom, although it agreed to the adoption of the Code of 1993, has made a political choice not to pay any more aid to the British mining industry. In the Commission's submission it is therefore the policy implemented by its own government which is affecting the applicant's economic interests. The applicant is attempting to impose the effects of that policy on the undertakings of other Member States by means of legal proceedings."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear that RJB Mining has briefed the Select Committee. I am sorry that I did not read the briefing before this sitting; I would not have needed to disrupt my hon. Friend's question by taking his document from him while he was speaking. On the judgment of the Court of First Instance, we have always believed that the future of the coal industry would be best secured by making it internationally competitive. We believe that subsidies paid in other EU countries that do not

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry has to operate globally, and the main challengers for UK coal are not German, French or Spanish but from countries outside the EU-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend points out that certain mining companies are investing in those other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to challenge coal imports, we must be competitive. Although the Court of First Instance criticised the British Government, our actions are in the long-term interest of the coal industry because they will secure global competitiveness. I recognise the difficulties caused by the very low price of coal. However, the Government cannot introduce systems of aid if we have no legal basis for doing so, or if doing so creates distortion, which would be even move damaging to the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee may be aware, I am passionate bout this issue. I would not minimise for one second, or in any way, the anxieties that exist in the coal communities. That is why I am keen to assure my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) that the future of our coal communities rests in making the United Kingdom coal as internationally competitive as possible. I shall not close any door in trying to find a way to assist the UK coal industry in facing its current difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. To help the Minister, and for the record, I confirm that the submission from RJB Mining (UK) Ltd. is appended to the European Scrutiny Committee report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some time ago, in a parliamentary answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), the Minister drew the House's attention to the subsidy that is being paid by the Spanish Government to their power stations in
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
respect of the burning of Spanish coal. In the light of the report's statement regarding the care with which the Commission has been monitoring state aid, is the Minister worried that the section of the report dealing with Spain makes no mention of that aid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I get the impression that the right hon. Gentleman is far more worried about the European Commission than the coal industry. Given the party that he supports, I suppose that I should not be surprised about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have successfully maintained a close watch on the operation of the Spanish industry in the context of the complaints that have been made about subsidies to power stations in Spain. In my opening remarks, I referred to our formal complaint against Spanish state aid, questioning the criteria of ultimate liability and whether they had been fulfilled in respect of all producers receiving operating aid under the ECSC coal state aid rules. Indeed, we have the Commission's agreement that the Spanish subsidy can be made available to UK exporters if they have contracts with Spanish power stations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trickett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister is a great friend of the coal industry, and I share her sense of intense frustration in relation to the difficulties that it is facing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to return to the subject of operating aid. As the Minister said, operating aid can be applied only if there is to be a reduction in production costs. I draw the Committee's attention to the end of paragraph 4 on page 10 of the document, which refers to the situation in Germany and Spain, where the equivalent of billions of pounds are pumped into the coal industry in operating aid. It suggests that that money is being spent because of social and regional factors, and that there is no hope that the coal industries in those countries will achieve economic equilibrium. That being so, the view of the legal advisers to the German and Spanish Governments must be that operating aid can be applied for reasons other than achieving a reduction in production costs, which the Ministers legal advisers have discussed with her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister prepared to place in the Library the legal opinions that she has received, so that they can be tested against the views that have been received by the German and Spanish Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I point out to my hon. Friend that the European Court of Justice rejected the argument in the report when it was advanced by the Commission's lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to his point about assistance to declining regions, we seek to help such communities through our regional assistance programme. The coalfields taskforce addresses issues of economic regeneration in the coalfield communities. For example, in respect of the sad situation in Ellington, Dr. John Bridge of the regional development agency is considering an action
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0863">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
plan for the Ellington area. Indeed, the coalfields taskforce published its document on economic regeneration in those areas in 1998. There is also an opportunity to look at the managed closure of the coalfields, but that would be an action of last resort; we want to explore every other avenue first. I shall discuss with my legal advisers whether we can put that advice into the House of Commons Library. My only anxiety is that it may contain information of a commercial nature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I received an answer from the Minister in response to my previous question when she said, "We continued with that policy". I interpreted that to mean that despite this enormously damning report on the state of the European coal industry, the Government will not change their approach to fighting for the United Kingdom coal industry in the European Commission against those subsidies, which I find intolerable. The charge is that the Government are pulling their punches in the European Union in order to pursue a wider policy goal of being good Europeans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another example of that in the Minister's answers to the European Scrutiny Committee. The question was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Has the Government taken the matter up with the Commission? If not, why has it, instead, restricted itself to supporting the complaints of individual companies?"</p></blockquote>
The Minister interpreted that in a narrow sense, emphasising the words "individual companies". She then listed a series of other narrow complaints, albeit that they were not confined to individual companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question that I believe the Scrutiny Committee was asking the Minister, and I should be grateful if she would try to answer it now properly, was this: "What high-level activity have the Government undertaken vis-à-vis the Commission, at summit level, at Ministerial level, at a very high political level"—not these individual complaints—to fight against the plethora of subsidies in Europe at present?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There must be a microchip inserted into the brains of members of the official Opposition, so that whenever the word Europe is mentioned the debate automatically has to be about Europe. The hon. Gentleman has not made a single proposal that would assist the United Kingdom coal industry, which is why so many of my hon. Friend's are on the Government Benches and the official Opposition is looking so isolated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We raised these matters at the highest level. I served in the Council of Ministers on both the energy council and the internal market council, both of which discussed state subsidies regularly, and not just subsidies to the coal industry. Indeed, it is in the Government's proposals for the Lisbon economic summit in March that part of the discussion should be
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
about the unfairness of state subsidies. If we are to create a truly competitive Europe, it must be on the basis of a forward-looking, knowledge-driven economy, which does not use the remedies of the past to address the problems of the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom coal industry is in difficulty because the previous Government pursued a vindictive policy towards it and failed to take into account the opportunities for the industry. Therefore, when they walked away from paying operating aid in 1994, they left the industry in a position where it found it extremely difficult to compete with other ECSC states. However, the commitment of those who work in the industry, and particularly those who work underground, has ensured that the industry has become much more competitive. I am looking at every possible way to ensure that that competitiveness can be continued and enhanced, it requires rational thought and a commitment to resolving the industry's difficulties now, instead of narrow, European, knee-jerk politicking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Grogan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister recognise that there has been a sea change of attitude in the European Commission over recent years? A report published just before Christmas showed that the EU would increase import dependency for energy from 47 per cent. now to 63 per cent. in 20 years' time. There is a real concern that we could be getting rid of the only competitive coal industry in Europe. Will the Minister redouble her discussions with the European Commission to see how the British coal industry can be helped?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What attitude will we take in 2002 and 2003 when the successor regime is up for negotiation? Will we consider using the veto if changes are not made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is asking me to envisage a scenario that I cannot necessarily determine. Of course, we will have been to the intergovernmental conference when we come to discuss the successor to the ECSC treaty. As a result of the enlargement of the European Union, many of the voting structures will have changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend spoke about decline of the coal industry. Continuing to make the United Kingdom's coal industry competitive will enable us to maintain it. Many significant difficulties, especially those in the deep-mined industry, are focused on the English coalfields. That is why we are examining the industry's request for fairness, not favours, and why we introduced a stricter gas consents policy, which, in relation to coal, helps to create a level playing field in the electricity market. That is why we are supporting research into clean coal technologies and why, even as we speak, we are examining how we can assist the industry's transition during a low-price period.

In that reply, the Minister said that the Government had expressed concern about the export of Polish coal to the UK market at prices which appeared to be below production costs. Apparently, it had been going on for some time. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have raised this issue both with the Polish Government and the European Commission who are responsible for ensuring that Poland meets the conditions of its accession arrangements to the EU. We have made clear that we expect Polish coal exported to the British Isles to be withdrawn unless its selling price can be shown to cover its appropriately allocated production and transportation costs."."—[

I sometimes wonder whether the hon. Gentleman understands how the international coal market operates and the small part that European coal plays in the United Kingdom market. Our challengers are global producers, which is why the issue of the UK's global competitiveness is so important. I should not be surprised that someone who represents such an inward-looking party does not understand how important it is to be globally competitive in a challenging world economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That brings us to the end of the time allotted for questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 10948/99, Commission report on the application of the Community rules for State Aid to the coal industry in 1996 and 1997; and supports the Government's actions in pressing the European Commission to interpret the Coal State Aid Code strictly.—[
	<i>Mrs. Liddell.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>11.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The starting point for our debate is a paragraph in the energy White Paper, which was published in October 1998. It says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"UK coal is produced at costs which are roughly a third of German production costs, and a quarter or less of Spanish costs."</p></blockquote>
The Minister referred to that in her remarks, and it may underestimate the efficiency of the UK coal industry. RJB Mining said in its submission to the Scrutiny Committee that the UK coal industry is more than five times more efficient than that in Germany or Spain. Despite that, subsidies to the coal industries in Germany, France and Spain run at about £3.5 billion a year. Their combined coal production, according to the figures on the third page of the European Commission's report, fell from 83.5 million tonnes in 1995 to 68 million tonnes by the end of 1998. In those three years, coal production in those countries fell by 15.5 million tonnes. In Britain during that period, production fell by 13.5 million tonnes—almost as much as in Germany, France and Spain combined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore have the absurd position that, in the words of RJB Mining's submission,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The current situation is having the perverse effect of closing Europe's most economic production capacity within the UK whilst preserving higher cost output in Germany, Spain and France."</p></blockquote>
We should be discussing that issue today. The coal industry is closing here, despite being five times more efficient, because the state subsidies that have been poured into the German, French and Spanish industries by their Governments result in their coal being cheaper than UK coal. Some legal challenges are successful, but coal production in Europe is not falling as fast as it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0865">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
should. Coal production in Britain is falling too fast, solely due to the existence of those continuing subsidies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission report is damning about the state of the European coal industry. It mentions the increase in the level of production-related state aid per tonne of coal extracted and points out that that directly contradicts the decision—decision No. 3632/93/ECSC—to reduce the level of state aid, which the Minister referred to. The Commission's report contains a far-reaching sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With the exception of a certain potential in the United Kingdom, the possibility of a Community coal industry which can compete commercially on the international markets can be definitively ruled out, despite the considerable efforts made by producers on both the technological and organisational fronts to improve productivity."</p></blockquote>
Those hard-hitting comments result in some damning conclusions.
	<br><blockquote><p>"While State aid can offer an adequate means of coping with economic crises, the state aid given to coal production in the EU has not been capable of providing an answer in economic terms to the structural crisis facing the European coal industry … The strategy of lowering production costs through the use of more advanced technology has proved ineffective".</p></blockquote>
The final paragraph says it all.
	<br><blockquote><p>"State aid tends to become absorbed into the economic fabric of the undertakings concerned, where it takes on a sort of life of its own: interests become established, habits become standard practice and turn into rights. A policy of reducing aid dependent on bringing down production costs thus becomes even more difficult to implement. Consequently, every time there has been a significant reduction in aid, it has been achieved through mine closures rather than any sharp drop in production costs in existing mines."</p></blockquote>
Those are the words of the European Commission, and those are the facts. However, politics are involved. The Minister's response to such a powerful Commission report, which helps Britain's case, is extremely weak. She said again today that she has not changed Government policy as a result of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

closure of British mines rather than mines elsewhere in Europe. That is unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's response to the European Commission's damning report stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government will continue to press the European Commission to interpret the Decision strictly and, in particular, to ensure that operating aid is only paid to those undertakings which can demonstrate that they can be competitive within a reasonable time period.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is saying that she will support aid only for undertakings that can demonstrate that they can be competitive within a reasonable period. Has she read the report?

The wording in the Minister's response sounded vaguely familiar. It is exactly the same as she used in the energy White Paper, published in October 1998. In paragraph 7.18, on page 59, it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government will continue to press the European Commission to interpret the Coal State Aid Code strictly and, in particular, to ensure that operating aid is only paid to those undertakings which can demonstrate that they can be competitive within a reasonable time period.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper was published in October 1998. The Commission report was published in September 1999. The Government might have read the report a few months before September 1999, but I doubt whether they did so before October 1998—before the White Paper was drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is back to time management. Is he aware that imports from France, Germany and Spain account for only 1 per cent. of imports into the UK?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's response was written before the Government had read the report. It was cut and pasted by civil servants. It is a limp response that demonstrates that the Government are not doing their level best to promote the British coal industry in Europe, either through lethargy or owing to their overall goal of being seen to be good Europeans. The Minister's response demonstrates a lack of earnestness, seriousness or determination to use the Commission's report to fight for British interests in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware of the executive summary of the evidence placed before the Committee by RJB Mining? It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"State Aid to other European coal producers is placing the UK coal industry at a competitive disadvantage."</p></blockquote>
That is the very point made by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that point. RJB Mining should know that as it runs most of the British and UK coal industry: thankfully, the Minister does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of November, I tabled a parliamentary question to which both my hon. Friends referred. I asked the Minister if she would list the measures that she had undertaken to ensure that EU states do not engage in practices that distort the European coal industry after 2002. Her reply included the following paragraph:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We will continue to press the European Commission to interpret the Code strictly and, in particular, to ensure that operating aid is paid only to those undertakings which can demonstrate that they can be competitive within a reasonable time period. Undertakings which cannot demonstrate this should be given closure aid only"—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 4 November 1999;Vol 337, C.285W.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister used exactly the same wording in her response to the report and in the energy White Paper of October 1998. Civil services have put these words together from parliamentary questions and the Government's response to the European Commission report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 18 of the Minister's response states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government seeks to ensure that aid which is approved by the Commission under the ECSC treaty does not unduly distort the market against unsubsidised producers in the ECSC market including those in the UK."</p></blockquote>
Does that sound familiar? The energy White Paper, which was published more than a year earlier, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government must ensure that aid which is currently approved by the Commission under the existing rules does not unduly distort the market against unsubsidised producers in the ECSC market including those in the UK".</p></blockquote>
It uses precisely the same wording. That demonstrates
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
a complete lack of sincerity or focus on this hugely important issue. The Minister uses crocodile tears and impassioned phrases to attack the previous Conservative Government, but the reality is that civil servants are putting policy together and she is not focused on it. It is simply not good enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronnie Campbell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the hon. Gentleman back a few years to when the Conservative Government, with the right hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The UK coal industry has undergone a transformation. It has suffered the pain and is now almost competitive in terms of world prices.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are having a debate today because the European Scrutiny Committee does not believe that the Minister's answers were full or responsible enough. The United Kingdom has, highly efficient coal industry which can produce coal at a price that is almost fully competitive on the world market. However, the massive state subsidies in Germany, France and Spain are affecting world market prices and driving existing UK coal production out of business, even though it is four or five times more efficient. The Minister's response is nothing but hand wringing. In the name of politics and the image of new Labour as good Europeans, the Government are letting down the British coal industry and that is lamentable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.44 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to make a plea for Ellington colliery within the confines of our debate on state aid for the coal industry. In three weeks, Ellington colliery, the last remaining pit of a great northern coalfield, will close. That will end 600 years of mining
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0867">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
and destroy 450 jobs—another chapter in our region's history. I hope to demonstrate why Ellington should not close. Following ECSC rules and operating subsidiaries could keep Ellington going during its short-term difficulties to build up to a long and decent future for the pit. I should like to give some of the background history of the mine and explain where I believe the future lies. I shall also touch on some of the immense social problems in the constituency, which in many ways are the legacy of previous coal mining closures. On a personal note, I worked at Ellington for nearly 30 years in my former life and so I speak with some authority and, I hope, knowledge of the industry and the pit itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ellington colliery, is situated off the Northumberland coast, at the very periphery of the industrial north-east. It was the jewel in the crown of British Coal, but it was closed in 1994 and put on to care and maintenance. It was taken over by RJB Mining in 1995, since when it has consistantly made a profit. It employs 450 men and produces nearly 1 million tonnes a year. It supplies coal directly into the Alcan aluminium smelter on the doorstep. It has 30 years of coal reserves left that are now accessible, yet it is to close on 28 February.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Ellington were a German, Spanish or even French mine it would certainly not be closing, as the comments made by the Minister and many other right hon. Members reveal. The problem is that Ellington does not have access to operating costs under Commission decision 3632/93/ECSC. The Government use that decision, not to subsidise the industry, but to cover inherent liabilities. As a Government, we accept and use the decision, but only part of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ellington produces coal at less than one third of the subsidy given to German mines. Ellington miners' productivity is five times that of their European counterparts. Of how many other industries in the UK can we honestly say that? Yet, we are seriously intent on allowing Ellington to close—a pit that is strategically important to the region and, I submit, to the nation and certainly to Europe. I genuinely hope that that closure does not go ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Richard Budge announced the closure of the mine on 1 November last year. He claimed that there were geological problems and a lack of markets, two quite important reasons for closing a mine. However there are no major geological problems at Ellington that cannot be overcome by using adequate roof supports. Furthermore, here is a market in the short term, and a good chance of securing a medium-term market, and the prospect of securing a long future for Ellington if we can get over the difficulties that the pit faces in the next few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The short and medium-term solution would be to operate as at present, by supplying Alcan power
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
station, the possibility now exists to supply Blyth power station which is only four miles away by a direct rail link, and is owned at present by National Power. It is part and parcel of a deal being negotiated with NRG, an American based company that is negotiating to take it over and run it as a mid-merit station for five to 10 years, thereby effectively creating a brand new market to coal from Ellington.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I met the European director of NRG who assured me that it wants to source its coal locally. The problem is the hard-nosed business people: if world coal prices are less than Ellington's the rest of the world is where the coal will come from. We have a short and medium-term solution to the problem. If operating aid were applied, Ellington coal could be burnt at Blyth power station. I could not think of a better example of why we should apply to ensure that state aid is available to assist Ellington.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We import more than 20 million tonnes of coal. I touched on that problem earlier, and my right hon. Friend the Minister replied honestly that the Government intend that all of that coal is sourced fairly, and that the dangers of dumped coal are stopped as quickly as possible. The long-term future for Alnwick could be secured by a visionary plan to build a new clean energy centre in the constituency. Three years down the line, the Wansbeck Energy Company, which is a public-private partnership, is in the second stage of developing a coal-based centre. It will provide for the establishment of a new power station and a recycling centre manufacturing waste pellets, which will be mixed with a coal and burned as a combined fuel. We also intend to develop and manufacture renewables on site, using an element of combined heat and power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Newcastle university is a world leader in photovoltaics—the science of converting light into energy. The UK's first off shore wind farm will be built in the north sea, and will be adjacent to an existing wind farm in the constituency, at the harbour mouth at Blyth. Unfortunately, the hardware that will be used for that is Danish. We intend to develop and manufacture wind turbines and photovoltaics on site. Ellington is crucial to providing what is probably a world first—a commercial, clean energy centre in a region that is rich in engineering and innovation. The first house ever to be lit by mains electricity is two miles outside the constituency, at Cragside in Rothbury. The use of operating aid would not only secure 450 jobs in Ellington, but would help to provide many more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A clear recognition of the huge social costs of colliery closures are central to Commission decision 3632. The French Government cocked a snook at the Commission, by saying that they would not comply with the 2002 deadline. They intend to continue with aid until at least 2005, because of severe social and regional problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ellington underpins our local economy, and injects
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0868">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
more than £20 million into it annually. In a recent national survey into deprivation, the district of Wansbeck came out as the 18th worst in England, after being the 58th worst two years ago. It dropped 40 places in two years, simply because of the effects of colliery closures. We have the second highest number of teenage pregnancies in the UK, after the London Borough of Lambeth. Unemployment remains consistent at twice the national average, and the area has rightly been described as an inner city pulled apart. I could quote statistics ad infinitum; I merely use them to draw the Committee's attention to the already massive social problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The closure of Ellington would worsen an unacceptable situation, so I hope that the statistics will strengthen the argument for the retention of Ellington collier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission rightly expresses its disappointment that the European coal industry, with the exception of the United Kingdom, will never be competitive. However, there is no word of threat to Germany, France and Spain that the subsidies will ever be taken away. In my view, whenever one tonne of coal is mined in Germany, it is mined with a heavy subsidy. If that continues for another century, I am sure that aid will be given to the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission is also about to undertake a review of the strategic gas, oil and coal reserves. It is a little late, but, none the less, the review is due to begin. I suspect that it will not want us to close the most efficient coal mining industry in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much debate recently about the north-south divide, and our attitude to our heartlands. I can think of no better example of a traditional area that needs the Government's help. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister rightly says that we govern for the whole nation, and I ask that we demonstrate that clearly by saving this industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Ellington closes, not only will damage be inflicted on the 450 workers and their families, but a skills base that has been built over generations will be lost. They are decent, hard-working people who ask not for favours but fairness. In some cases, skills were handed down from father to son. No amount of retraining or special packages, however well intentioned, will replace that skills base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final statement on Commission decision 3632/93 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This decision shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all member states."</p></blockquote>
I travelled to Brussels and spoke to officials from directorate-general XVII. They said that they would welcome with open arms an application for aid to protect Europe's most efficient mining industry, but my right hon. Friend the Minister has been given different advice. I suggest that we test those opposing views. Let the Government formally apply for operating aid and, where relevant in the future, closure
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
aid. I urge her to make that application forthwith, and keep Ellington open until a decision is reached. She has nothing to lose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister genuinely cares about the mining industry and the communities that rely on it. We have had many meetings, and she has worked hard to secure a solution to the many problems. In her heart of hearts, she would be as pleased as me if the application were successful. In the meantime, I urge her to keep Ellington open while we await a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, Mr. McWilliam, I thank you for allowing me to express my views to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.57 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ellington colliery is in my constituency. I have had a number of meetings with the Minister and the Secretary of State, some of which were attended by other hon. Members whose constituencies are affected, including the hon. members for Wansbeck (Mr. Murphy) and for Blyth Valley. Many of their constituents work at the pit, as do the constituents of many other hon. Members. Men who have been displaced from other parts of the coal industry travel from your own constituency, Mr. McWilliam, which is south of the Tyne, to work at Ellington colliery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report and the issue of state aid must be viewed against the background of the threat to close Ellington colliery, which will be carried out in fewer than three weeks unless decisive action is taken. The impact of closure would be felt not only in the urban area immediately to the south of the colliery, but in the rural ex-mining area to the north. When I was first elected, there were four working pits in the area; now there is only Ellington. The pit's closure will have a severe impact on small communities between Ellington and Alnwick, for which there is no other source of employment. That is why we have pressed the Minister hard to look at the available options, so that a pit that has demonstrated its viability might benefit from the aid that we are discussing today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Coal closed Ellington colliery when it was publicly owned, which is no great advertisement for nationalisation. It was reopened by RJB Mining (UK), and the pit's work force achieved spectacular productivity. Its viability is related to the fact that it directly supplies the adjoining Alcan power station. The pit reserves that can be worked with no great difficulty, and potentially enormous reserves that could be worked, were further investment to be made after clarification of the coal price issue. Given the present uncertainty about the coal price, it is difficult to see how a private concern could make a substantial investment. Like the rest of the English coal industry, the pit needs a breathing space. It needs the opportunity to get through a difficult and unstable period, to which the problems of subsidies that are provided elsewhere merely add. One cannot blame all the UK coal industry's difficulties on European
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0869">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
subsidies, although they do not help—they sustain uneconomic capacity and add insult to injury because no help is given to the UK industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take issue with the Minister because she wants a scheme that is legally robust. Politicians in Germany, Spain and France make payments to producers although their schemes are almost certainly not legally robust. While the Minister is seeing advisers, politicians in those countries are making payments to producers for reasons that we understandably challenge. For example, we challenge developments in France. For the past three years, French politicians have not submitted agreed figures for state aid to the Commission—they have not done so since 1997. The Commission is unable to authorise aid without submitted figures, but the French have simply withheld details in the knowledge that by 2002 the agreement will have expired and the aid programme will probably have been phased out. The French are certainly not looking for a legally robust arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an element of what I call subsidiunilateralism about this matter. We do not like what is going on elsewhere in Europe, and we should prefer it if nothing were happening. The British Government and officials say, "We do not like that policy, so we shall not take the risk of putting together what we think is a legally acceptable scheme. There is a risk that it could be challenged in the courts." However, people in Berlin, Paris or Madrid do not appear to lose much sleep worrying about being taken to the European Court—they get on with things. There are good reasons for keeping within the European rules and for respecting the rules of degression and of inviolability. We could maintain an operating subsidy that is similar to that which operated between 1993 and 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise a technical point, which the Minister might prefer to respond to in writing. The report says that the UK's operating subsidy ended in 1994, but figures from the Library, which are based on reports from the Department of Trade and Industry, suggest that £5.6 million was paid out in 1995–96. There is some confusion about when the operating subsidy ended. However, that suggests that there is a baseline from which we could work—a lowest point was reached while payments were still being made. The Minister's earlier comments suggest that she has an alternative route, by which an acceptable operating subsidy would relate the degression to payments that are made throughout Europe rather than to one country in it. In one way or another, I am sure that where there is a will there is a way and that means can be found to help the industry to get over this short-term difficulty and to secure Ellington colliery's survival.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objective in the long term must be a competitive coal industry that does not depend on state aid. I understand why the Government have that objective—

that is why we are considering the motion. We might realise that objective in four, five or 10 years' time, but we should score a hollow victory if there was no UK coal industry left to benefit from improvements in competitiveness. There would be some open cast mining and much imported coal, but no functioning pits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I plead with the Minister to take a few risks in relation to what she calls legal robustness. She should put together a scheme that will help us to get through this short-term situation and give the most competitive coal industry in Europe—it is the only industry that is recognised as having future competitiveness—the chance to show what it is capable of. That would also protect jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Trickett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The report demonstrates that the European energy policy, especially in so far as it relates to coal, is a shambles. This lacerating report states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the gap between production costs in the Community coal industry and the price of coal on the international markets…has become entrenched over the years rather than narrowing, as hoped."</p></blockquote>
On the continent, operating aid worth £3.5 billion a year is given to the coal industry, but the gap between production costs and the international price of coal has not narrowed. However, our industry, which is the only one with a chance of competing internationally, is declining despite the fact that it is the most efficient on Europe. Coalfields are closing because the Tories established a regime that was designed to finish off the coal industry. We will take no lessons from Opposition Members on this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will urgently consider taking action to introduce operating aid. It is evident that the legal advice that is available to Governments in Germany, France and Spain is different to that which our Government have received. We have the will to help the coal industry—my right hon. Friend is passionate about that—and that necessary legal powers. The report does not say that what is happening on the continent is illegal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two reasons why we should introduce operating aid to save our coal industry. The first was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck, who exemplified the effect of pit closures on communities. There are no pits left in my community, but many of my constituents work in the Yorkshire coalfield. We know what impact further closures will have on communities. The human price is enormous and the effect on communities lasts for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason is in the energy White Paper. It clearly states that the Government are committed to ensuring secure energy supplies. The indigenous gas supply that is available to the United Kingdom is declining fast. In a written question tabled last week, I asked my right hon. Friend how long our gasfields
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0870">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
would last, given that the current rates of depletion and the additional gas consents that have been granted. Unfortunately, I have not yet received an answer, but it is probably fewer than a dozen years. When that happens, we will have to rely on nuclear power from France. In the past six weeks, we have seen that supply diminish from 100 per cent. to 30 per cent., which has increased the use of coal by 1.2 million tonnes. Worse than that, we will have to rely on gas supplies from unstable political and geological regions in eastern Europe and the middle east. No indigenous supplies of energy will be left if the coal industry dies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our national interest—our future—lies with coal, as it always has. If the industry dies, we will be in the hands of energy suppliers that are in deep jeopardy. Because of the human impact, the national strategic interest and the European considerations, only British coal is capable of competing internationally. That is why we should begin the process of making operating aid available to the British coal industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[MR. DAVID BORROW 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<p>The Minister twice mentioned making operating aid available to opencast deep-mined coal. As I understand it, opencast coal is being produced for less than the price of coal on the international market. Therefore, operating aid cannot be made available to opencast mines. I have no brief for opencast mining; I doubt that many of my hon. Friends do. Operating aid should be non-discrimatory, but the market will ensure that it is so, because opencast coal is produced much more cheaply than deep-mined coal. I look forward to the Minister's response, and hope that he will give the Committee some indication that, in principle at least, the Government are prepared to make money available, if legal means can be found to do so.</p>

	<p>When I go around former mining communities in my constituency, I am constantly asked how the British agricultural industry can receive billions of pounds in grant aid—more money than the assistance available to all the rest of British industry—while not a penny can be found to assist coal mining communities, who created the wealth of the country from the time of the industrial revolution.</p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed with the Minister's response to my technical questions about the report's contents because I know that he is an entirely fair and reasonable person. However, as I hope to show to the Committee, there were reasons for my probing. The Committee's purpose is to scrutinise the contents of the report. According to the rules of the House, that can be done in several ways. It is just as appropriate
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
for me to probe a document such as this in technical terms as it is for representatives of coal communities to put forward their views on the industry. I am the first to understand why Labour Members continue to be critical of the previous Government's actions. The previous Government took their decisions about the future of the coal industry recognising that the world's energy markets were changing, but I understand why the Conservative party continues to be criticised for something that was so painful for coal communities. A similar situation has arisen in my constituency as a result of the restructuring of the defence industry and, notwithstanding what the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Trickett) said, we have also seen problems in the farming industry. I have done what I can to fight for the latter two industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that, despite eloquent testimony from both sides of the Committee about the future of Ellington colliery, no amendment has been tabled to the motion. I understand that it would have been in order to table an amendment, which would have enable those who speak with passion on the coal industry to put on record their views about helping that colliery and to have voted on the issue. However, as there is no such amendment, we are left with the vehicle of a "take note" motion to allow us to make our observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general thrust of the concerns that have been expressed so far by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee is that highly subsidised coal production has been maintained in other parts of Europe at the expense of an efficient coal industry in the United Kingdom. The reason for my first question about the time it took for the Commission to act on some of the matters raised in the report was the feeling, which was reflected in earlier comments, that no matter what the Commission does, politically subsidised coal activity will continue in the rest of Europe at the expense of our industry. Whatever the Commission report states, it will not stop Germany, France and others from spending money. As its conclusions show, those countries are not getting to grips with the fundamental issues of Europe's coal industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the nuclear fuel in the country is manufactured in my constituency. The output of the British Nuclear Fuels plant at Springfield may, indirectly, also be a beneficiary of the line taken by the hon. Gentleman. Given what has happened in our electricity industry and the efficiencies that occurred as a result of the previous Government's policies, there is merit in exploring that option because there should be no barriers to trade in a free market. The hon. Gentleman takes a positive point of view, which is that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0871">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
when our coal is more economic than that of our European competitors, it could be exported by wire. I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman, and my constituents may ultimately be the beneficiaries of such a suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conclusion of the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While State aid can offer an adequate means of coping with economic crises, the state aid given to coal production in the EU has not been capable of providing an answer in economic terms to the structural crisis facing the European coal industry."</p></blockquote>
That is a pretty damning conclusion. It is interesting because the report contains no cost-benefit analysis. The Commission does not go beyond recording money spent, and stating the economic outcomes. That is disappointing. I asked the Minister probing questions because scrutiny involves trying to discover how thoroughly the European Commission is tackling some of the issues and concerns being advanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A problem with European institutions is that they move with electrifying speed when dealing with British beef in Europe, for example, but they are amazingly tardy when dealing with the issues in the report. Why did it take so long to discover what has been going on in member states? The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) hinted at the reason when he pointed out that France had not submitted certain information to the Commission.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The blame for the audit cannot all be laid at the door of the previous Government. With respect to the hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the right hon.

great number of times under the previous Conservative Government, of which he was a member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the right hon. Lady, I must say that she makes my point for me. I am saying that a quicker and more thorough audit process would have enabled the European Commission to act in a more timely fashion in identifying the failures of the regime that has caused an inappropriate subsidy to go to our European competitors. As the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) rightly said, the opportunity to allow the output of power stations powered by UK deep-mined coal to go in the direction of our European competition has been inhibited. If a better scrutiny system had been in place, we would have made more progress of the sort that right hon. Lady suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about that question of scrutiny. In the explanatory memorandum sent to Committee members, the Minister did not question any aspects of the production of the report. I should like to have known more about the audit facilities used in producing it. Spain's subsidy to the coal-burning part of its electricity industry seems to have been a fairly late discovery, and such revelations make me concerned about the effectiveness of the rest of the report. One of its overriding conclusions is that the money paid to our European competitors has not lowered costs through the use of more advanced technology. The report says that that policy has proved to be ineffective, but the Commission submitted no proposal to the Council of Ministers to challenge the policy with which it was proceeding, which, by its own analysis, delivers a zero result. Had the Commission been bolder, some of the important issues that Labour Members have raised in relation to the state and effectiveness of our own coal industry could have been aired in the Council of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Europe wants to modernise itself and to become more competitive and effective, our partners would have recognised, had the case been put to them, that our coal industry had the opportunity to contribute to Europe's overall competitiveness via the energy route mentioned by the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone. However, that argument was not advanced, partly because it has taken so long to produce a report on which we can comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clapham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon.

Gentleman. The same anxieties were expressed to me by many people concerned with the nuclear industry. As I said, all the nuclear fuel in the country is manufactured in my constituency.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to trespass into more dangerous territory by considering the final conclusion on page 22 regarding the Commission's observations on the relationship between coal and gas and CO
	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions. The Minister mentioned the changed arrangements in the operation of the electricity pool, which would "even things out", as she put it, so that coal would get a fair opportunity. To help me to understand more, will she explain how the Government are dealing with a fuel that produces more carbon dioxide than others and with the climate change levy? The Government's objective is to reduce the output of CO
	<div class='sub'>2.</div> <!-- sub --> The highest rate of climate change levy is on electricity, some of which is generated by coal; whereas a lower rate is put on the straightforward use of coal in its own right. I would be interested in having an explanation of the underlying policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report notes that not only are the Germen Government still paying subsidy, but the German Lander are now in on the act. During the beef crisis, one problem in implementing European policy was that the Lander had imposed the ban on beef going to Germany, and they were untouchable because that policy was on a Government-to-Government basis. Do the rules about subsidy in the coal industry, with which the report deals, apply equally to payments from the German Lander and to those from the German Government? Government Members would be distressed to find that the German Government were
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
saying that they would reduce subsidy, but that the Länder were continuing to provide the moneys by the back-door.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been useful. I pay tribute to those who have spoken with eloquence about Ellington colliery and its future. I should be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on the issue. I conclude where I started—if Government Members had wanted to press their case, they should have tabled an amendment.

We have seen the restructuring of the industry since 1994. The rump of the industry was privatised—destroyed by revenge politics, as I remarked to the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack). What is left can be shaped to make a valuable contribution to the UK energy economy. The right hon. Gentleman said that he had seen no cost-benefit analysis in the report; the previous Administration made no cost-benefit analysis when they were destroying mining communities. I can provide a few figures from my community to show how that happened. For example, in 1998 a survey showed that the average income on council estates in the Barnsley borough was between £5,000 and £6,000. Of course, that will have risen because of the Government's introduction of the minimum wage and the working families tax credit, but incomes remain low. The average across the borough at the time of the survey was £11,000, compared with an average income for Yorkshire and Humberside of £18,300. Those figures show clearly the depressed state of that former mining community. There was no cost-benefit analysis by the previous Administration. Had there been, I expect they would have been prepared to ensure that subsidies were paid to the industry to secure its continuity, rather than allow communities to be destroyed, as they were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Minister referred to the significant cut in costs made by the industry. Coal is now offered to the generators at between £1.15 and £1.20 per gigajoule. In 1994, when the industry was privatised, the cost was £1.50 per gigajoule. The miners whose effort and endeavour went into that cost reduction and who worked with management towards it have brought about great benefit. While costs have been decreasing, because of the value of the pound and increased coal imports from Australia, South Africa, and south and north America, their endeavours have been undercut. The right hon. Member for Fylde referred earlier to the amount of coal on the European market, but I remind the Committee that it is estimated that, in the next 10 years, 6 billion tonnes of coal will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0873">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
be traded in world markets. Europe is only a small part of that world market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, the coal industry is important to the British energy market. If we succeed in the negotiations shortly to commence on the interconnector contracts, we shall be able to make opportunities for the industry. At the same time, the pool reforms are to take place. Hon. Members will remember that the Government responded speedily to the first coal industry crisis in 1997 and 1998 with a moratorium on gas consents and by tackling the problems in the pool left by the previous Administration. Those pool reforms will, I hope, be complete by next year, resulting in a reduction in the price of electricity. The likely method of structuring prices could help the coal industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are moving towards an energy market in Europe. The future of the coal industry in the United Kingdom is to export electricity into Europe. That is why I urge my right hon. Friend the Minister to re-examine the operational aid that may be available in Europe, to take us in to the European energy market. If we can maintain the United Kingdom coal industry until that market is open, it has a future. We also need to consider more investment in clean coal technology, to ensure the industry's continuity and contribution to the United Kingdom energy market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clapham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. There are 17 producing collieries throughout the UK: two in Wales, one in Scotland and 14 in the English coal field. If the prognosis made by CLG consultants is even partially correct, the result of action not being taken could be devastating, with up to two thirds of the industry lost by 2001. I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister takes issue with that report; nevertheless, it flags up the coal mining industry's precarious position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must remember that we also have a very successful mining equipment manufacturing industry that brings in excess of £300 million a year in exports. If we lost the coal industry, some of those manufacturers might have to resite in countries such as America and Australia, which still have coal mining industries. The closure of the proportion of our industry suggested by CLG consultants could have a devastating effect on the UK economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister has worked hard and used every endeavour to find a solution to the problems of the coal mining industry, but I urge her to put in that extra effort and consider whether we could apply to Europe to draw down state
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
aid, just to give us the means of reaching the point when the European energy market opens. I believe that that will give the UK coal mining industry a sustained future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Uniquely, I represent about 2,500 coal miners and some 2,500 farmers, so the dilemma that my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth mentioned is particularly acute in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is that if there had not been the change of policy in 1997, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham), referred, and had the Government not shown their commitment to the coal industry by instituting a stricter gas contents policy, a review of the pool which is now leading to the Utilities Bill and a transformation of the electricity industry, and the beginnings of action on the interconnector—I note that even this month there is a seminar in London on trying to get a two-way flow going before 2001—the Selby coalfield would have disappeared by now, along with a lot more of the coal industry. We inherited an electricity industry that was distorted and biased against coal and in favour of gas and nuclear power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are now in a renewed state of crisis, despite massive productivity increases. As my hon. Friend said, we are down to £1.15 per gigajoule, which is a 20 per cent. increase in productivity over several years. Coal is a truly modern and flexible industry of which both old and new Labour should be proud. It is not competitive at the moment, for obvious reasons, including the fall in global demand for coal, which is partly owing to the economic crisis in the far east and the strength of the pound. However, the gap is extremely narrow and our industry is nearly competitive on world markets—it is just a question of a few pence per gigajoule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not heard how big a subsidy the industry would need—if Europe authorised one—to make coal competitive for the next two to three years, until the state aid regime is next reviewed. Most analysis talk of between £50 million and £60 million a year, which is not a huge figure. It is nothing like the £3 billion cumulative total of subsidies in Germany, Spain and France last year. It is a relatively modest amount, but it would enable our coal industry to survive and prosper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck, I, too, have used my air miles to travel to Brussels and talk to European Commission officials. If there is a need for clarity, I would look forward to seeing any legal opinions my right hon. Friend the Minister could put in the Library, but I repeat my offer: I am happy to use the air miles that I have left to go to Brussels with her officials to clarify the position, as are my hon. Friends. While in Brussels, I was given four reasons why the Commission would be likely to approve any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0874">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
application for state aid. I realise that, since taking office, she has redoubled, if that were possible, the previous Minister's efforts to find a way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first reason why the Commission would be likely to agree to an application for operating or closure aid is the obvious fact that state aid has not degressed in Europe during the past few years; it has almost doubled from 28 ecu per tonne to 48 ecu per tonne in five years. Commission officials say that it would be possible to interpret degression across the whole Europe Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason is that the agreement will be renewed in 2002–03. It is highly unlikely that countries such as Germany, where 70,000 miners will work in the Saar and the Ruhr, would object to a British application for a modest amount of £50 million or £60 million, given that a veto has been established this morning on the continuance of state aid after 2002–03.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trickett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the hint that a veto may be sued might induce in other countries and the Commission a more vigorous attitude to the United Kingdom's position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Grogan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that such matters have been aired in the Committee this morning is useful. We obviously have a strong negotiating hand in Brussels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third reason why the Commission would be likely to agree is that the French are highly unlikely to object. Last December, I asked Commission officials when they expected to receive the French application for state aid for 1997–98, and they said "Christmas". I asked whether they meant in a few weeks' time, and they said, "No; Christmas 2002".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final reason is that, as I mentioned in a question to the Minister, a sea change is taking place in Europe. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck said, energy supply across Europe is being reviewed. We undertook a similar review two years ago in this country. The projection is that 70 per cent. of the EU's total energy supply will be imported by 2020. The Commission is alarmed that if the EU is heavily dependent on imported gas, it could have similar ramifications to those of the 1970s when we depended on imported oil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is every prospect of success if we make such an application. How could we justify an application? What is our attitude to subsidies elsewhere in the EU? It has been suggested that this is a matter of being good Europeans. I would not say that all subsidies should disappear immediately from Germany or Spain, because that would not be acceptable. It is a matter of social justice, of being civilised people, and of doing things decently, not as they were done in the 1990s when communities were devasted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are economic reasons why coal should be subsidised, especially in Britain; we are the only country that can produce efficient coal. However, most of this country's coal industry could disappear in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
next two years, which would be a tragedy. All the contracts with the power generators will be up for grabs in that period. Drax, which is in my constituency, has been taken over by AES, an American company, which must decide by March whether to sign up for British coal beyond 2001. Such decisions are imminent, and we must preserve something of the British coal industry to maintain diversity of supply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must structure the decline in a civilised way for those parts of the British coal industry that will close—Selby in my constituency will be exhausted by 2009–10—and pay respect to the tremendous debt that we as a nation owe miners over the generations. Knowing the Minister's background and passion for the coal industry, I am confident that she and her Cabinet colleagues will deliver results for the coal industry and, perhaps more importantly, for our nation and our balanced energy policy, as we did two years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several moving speeches have been made, especially in relation to Ellington colliery, which I shall address in a moment. I have to be less generous about the official Opposition, however. The Commission report that we are discussing relates to 1996–1997. Hon. Members may recall that the Government were not elected until May 1997. So the period when unfair state aid was being paid was during the lifetime of the previous administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within months of Labour coming to office it was apparent that we had to respond to the threat of a further round of pit closures as coal contracts with the electricity generators came to an end. The Government consequently launched an investigation into the state of the industry and the electricity generation market. Several strands have emerged from our discussion this morning, not least from my right hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone, who referred to some of the Select Committees conclusions in respect of the electricity generation market. As has been said, as a result of that examination of the electricity generation market, we introduced stricter consents for the building of gas-fired power stations. At the time there were great discussions about the dash for gas and that, together with distortions on the operation of the electricity pool, made it difficult for the coal industry to compete. Indeed, the investigation launched by the Government at the time concluded that the generation market was not working competitively and that the coal industry did not operate on a level
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0875">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
playing field. To address that unfairness and to stimulate competition, the Government introduced a major programme of reform, which will occupy several Members of the Committee for several months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Borrow</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was crucial that the Government stopped automatic consents to gas-fired power stations. That is a temporary measure. Have the Government been able to estimate how many jobs were delayed as a result of that policy in order to give the coal industry a much-needed breathing space?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised an important point. People tend to forget that the stricter gas consents policy comes at considerable cost. Our estimates, based on the construction of the power stations, suggest the potential loss of 6,000 jobs. Indeed, the oil and gas industries are speculating that in the longer term the stricter gas consents policy could be put around 10,000 jobs at risk. So that policy can be only a temporary measure because it creates major distortion in another energy market. However, I say that not to balance one energy market against another, but to give a measure of the Government's commitment to the coal industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The coal industry provides terrific flexibility for our energy markets. Hon. Members have raised the issue of security of supply. However, the ECSC treaty concludes that security of supply need not take into account just domestic supply—in other words, there is a global market for coal, often at competitive prices. The access to that is measured rather than domestic supply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen the impact of that flexibility in recent months and it has meant good news for the coal industry. The interconnector between the UK and France has been running at half power for the past week or so because of the need for unscheduled maintenance, which has greatly increased imports of electricity. If that shortfall is made up by coal, and the signs from the industry are that that is happening, it is equivalent to 300,000 tonnes of coal burn per week. Additionally, the need for repair and maintenance at some UK nuclear stations. Therefore, as at December 1999, an additional 800,000 tonnes of coal has been required to make up for that. That is good news in he short term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the bigger issue confronting the industry is the fact that coal imports from Australia and other parts of the world can be delivered to UK power stations at a much lower price than coal that is dug in this country. As I said to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, ECSC imports from France, Germany and Spain account for only 1 per cent. Indeed, ECSC domestically produced coal accounts for only 40 per cent. of the total. In reality, it is the industry's ability to compete in an international market
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
that is significant, so we must ensure that UK coal is competitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the tragic situation in Ellington, where I met some of the workers last week. One of the least pleasurable aspects of being a Minister was hearing of the hardship that people are anticipating as the result of the colliery's closure. At the time of privatisation, however, Ellington was given only a five-year life span because of its geology. Of course, it is a privatised pit which has made significant improvements in competitiveness. I know that the Ellington community will be reading the report of our debate and I pay tribute to what they did to make that pit competitive. However when RJB Mining indicated that it intended to close Ellington, it drew attention to the deteriorating geological conditions and referred to "unacceptable safety risks".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take exception to that. The reality is that what is required—RJB was clear on this—is a new set of powered roof supports, because the ones that operate at the moment are not equipped for the new strata. It is as simple as that. I am afraid that my right hon. Friend the Minister was in danger of misleading the Committee, although not intentionally, by saying that the geological conditions are severe, because they are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to go with what a privatised proprietor tells the Government. The press release is clear, as were the discussions that I had with the industry. I must also point out to my hon. Friend that the Government have never received a specific Ellington-based proposal for assistance. I know that whenever there were discussions between RJB Mining and that strange character, Giovanni di Stefano, it was estimated that it would cost £1 million a month to keep Ellington open. In private conversations with me, my hon. Friend said that he had been told that it would take £10 million to keep Ellington open, but I have not received a proposal based on that figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is all water under the bridge. We hope that the problems facing Ellington will not be replicated in other communities. My hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck asked whether I could keep Ellington open, but the Government do not own it, so we cannot keep it open. I though that my hon. Friend made some important points about renewable energy and other industries in the area. I know something about that because I recently launched a joint document with the local community there. My Department will give careful consideration to what he said and see whether we can assist in generating new employment in the energy industries to which my hon. Friend referred. I do not for a minute take lightly what he must be going through as a former employee of Ellington or, indeed, the experience of the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) many of whose constituents are also effected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now move on to the broader issues that are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0876">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
confronting the industry. The subject of operating aid was raised several times and my hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) and others asked why the Government did not submit a proposal. The Commission would say that it would welcome a proposal with open arms, but welcoming a proposal and agreeing to it are two different things. As I said earlier, we must ensure that we do not create an additional difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed the opencast industry this morning. I have met opencast producers, who told me that they are experiencing problems and may have to challenge the Government on discrimination grounds if we favour deep-mined coal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of Ellington, does the Department of Trade and Industry's budget have headroom in the forthcoming financial year? If it does, that would enable the Government to respond positively if the Minister received some form of application.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman was a Minister, so he knows that when a crisis occurs we are in a position to make an application to the Treasury. We would have to apply to the Treasury for assistance as we do not have the headroom at the moment. The Treasury does not always guarantee to give money, but it is prepared to listen to requests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several points emerged from our discussion of operating aid, which I shall examine. The only proposal made so far by a proprietor is for an industry-wide solution. However, operating aid is linked to reducing introduction costs so it must relate to specific mine developments. Not a day passes when I do not reconsider those issues. Of course, to some extent we would have to change our arguments with Germany, France and Spain. However, we are prepared to do that if we can find a legally robust way of doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By instinct, we all back off from closure aid because it means no more development work. Indeed, it means that the writing is on the wall for the industry. However, we shall continue to tackle such serious and important problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
In turn to our relationship with the European Commission which, I agree, could handle such matters much better. We maintain pressure on the commission to improve its performance and significantly change how it goes about its business. Britain is not the only country to suffer consequences: taxpayers in Germany, France and Spain are paying subsidies for an industry that is not internationally competitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Specific matters have been raised, and I shall try to tackle as many as I can in the limited time available. A reduction in subsidies to German, French and Spanish coal would not necessarily result in the shortfall in demand at power stations being met by coal: it could be met by oil or gas. However, our aim is to reduce distortion so that an increasingly competitive industry will continue to be competitive throughout the United Kingdon. I must emphasise, however, that UK coal remains substantially more expensive than imported coal from non-EU countries. Subsidies in EU countries are not the main obstacle and will not be a major form of rescue for the coal industry, either. We continue to lobby the Commission to ensure fairness and straightforwardness in relation to coal subsidies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, we have had an interesting debate in which I have taken a close interest. I represent a mining constituency, so the coal industry is close to my heart. I am one of the few women to be an honorary member of the National Union of Mineworkers and do not take lightly any of the issues that we have been discussing. We will do our utmost to give what assistance we can to the coal industry within the legal constraints facing us. The stricter gas consents policy has given industry fairness, not favours, as was expected. I reiterate that we will not close the door on any analysis in order to find ways of assisting the British coal industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
