</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems quite reasonable that, where the board determines to refuse an application, it should give notification in writing to the unsuccessful applicant within a reasonable timescale. There is a 21-day period for appeal and, in order to tie in at the other end, seven days would seem to be a reasonable move forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now comment on amendment No. 197. Where there is an intention to debar an applicant from registration, it is reasonable to take measures to look out for the interests of the clients of that debarred solicitor. It is important to ensure that timescales are quite clear. It is suggested that there should be a move away from taking immediate action to transfer clients and debar that solicitor towards allowing time for an appeal to be formulated. That suggestion possibly goes beyond our requirements, but I would be interested in the views of my right hon. Friend, the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>
With reference to amendment No. 213—it seems perfectly reasonable to suggest reasons for the removal from the register of the solicitors of any individual. Amendment No. 213 inserts the word "shall" rather than the phrase "need not".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr for providing his helpful explanation. All the amendments have a common theme. They relate to procedures for the removal of the names of solicitors and firms from the register of those who can provide criminal and legal assistance, and to the procedures for the publication of the register and decisions on registration. They are detailed and technical amendments; they do not raise the major policy issues that we debated earlier today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the amendments that my hon. Friend has tabled I can undertake to consider, some of them I cannot—I shall refer to the ones that he mentioned. Amendment No. 174 would require the board to give reasons for a refusal within seven days. It is intended that the board should notify the applicant and give reasons as soon as practicable after making its decision. The correct way to set time limits is through charter statements. I would, therefore, urge my hon. Friend to withdraw that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned amendment No. 197, which amends section 25D(6) of the 1986 Act, requiring a solicitor whose name is removed from the register to arrange for the transfer of criminal legal assistance work currently being undertaken by him to another registered solicitor or a directly employed solicitor. Sub-paragraph (a) states that this must be done
	<br><blockquote><p>"in accordance with arrangements approved by the Board… and without waiting for the resolution of any appeal".</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to strike out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"without waiting for the resolution of any appeal"</p></blockquote>
Those words were inserted to safeguard clients of a solicitor whose name had been removed from the register by the board because the board was satisfied that he was not complying with the code. They ensure that the client is immediately transferred to another appropriate solicitor, even though the solicitor appeals against his removal. Otherwise, there could be some doubt as to what happens on appeal. These measures are required for the protection of clients receiving criminal legal assistance and I urge my hon. Friend to accept that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend went on to speak to amendment No. 212, which seeks to amend section 25F. That section provides for the publication by the board of the register and of decisions concerning refusal to insert or remove names from the register. The board is not obliged to publish reasons for such decisions. Taken with amendment No. 213, to which my hon. Friend referred, the amendment is designed to ensure that the board publishes reasons for such decisions. The thinking behind the amendments is understandable: the system whereby names are inserted or removed from the register should be open and accountable. I give my hon. Friend the assurance that I am prepared to consider them further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>365</span>
Amendment No. 214 requires the board to send a copy of the current register to the secretary of the Law Society as soon as practicable after 1 November each year instead of 1 April. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for explaining the reasons for the amendment, which I also undertake to consider. With those assurances, I hope that my hon. Friend will not feel it necessary to press the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy with those assurances and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood my right hon. Friend the Minister to say earlier that he would amend clause 45 at a later date, given the requirement for pilot schemes. We had a long debate on clause 44 and I do not want to detain the Committee by going through the arguments again, but I want to register the fact that the Minister undertook to amend clause 45.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>FIXED PAYMENTS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise some aspects of costs under the clause. They did not get an airing earlier but they are relevant. For example, in a criminal case there might be an exceptional cost for bringing forward witnesses. It might be necessary to bring someone from another country such as the United States. Would that kind of cost be admissible under the Bill? Such a hefty and exceptional cost could arise. Is allowance to be made for it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
When forensic evidence is required will there be cost cutting by calling for one forensic expert to serve both prosecution and defence, or will the defence be allowed to pay for its own forensic expert?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue relating to cost is that the prosecution has sometimes let people off a serious crime by saying that if they plead guilty to charges one, two and three, charges four, five and six will not be pushed. How would that affect the judgment about fixed payments for criminal legal assistance? An accused person with a string of charges against him will be in the hands of his lawyer who will decide what is in his best interests. But if the court wants to get through a huge backlog of cases it might be motivated simply to drop charges. Issues such as that will affect payments. How can one compare like with like when assessing the costs of running the pilot scheme because issues like that could arise? Will an allowance be built in for that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, attempting to assess the costs of such a scheme will be a much more difficult exercise than one might imagine. It might require a good deal of ingenuity by accountants to work out a real comparison of like with like. I am also concerned about the possibility of a defendant having exceptional costs. Will that be allowed? Will it be possible to allow for exceptional costs such as bringing in a witness at great expense?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady asks the important question as to whether an exceptional cost of bringing in witnesses would be covered. The answer is that it would. An outlay could be provided for separately. The same applies to expert witnesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would allow the Scottish Legal Aid Board to make prescribed fixed payments to solicitors in respect of criminal legal assistance provided by them. It does not remove existing legislative provision in relation to payments that can be made from the legal aid fund. It simply allows the Secretary of State the option of prescribing fixed payments and brings the position in Scotland into line with that in England and Wales where the legislation governing legal aid allows for such payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fixed payments would give a greater degree of control over legal aid expenditure than is possible under the current payment arrangements. They would also reduce the administrative burden on both the board and solicitors. We therefore consider it sensible to ensure that the option of making payments in that way is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause gives the option of prescribing fixed sums which can include all or some outlays. For outlays such as waiting or travelling time it may be fairer to continue to let those be charged separately. However, that will be the subject of consultation with the Law Society. It should be possible to devise a system that recognises the complexity of certain types of cases and the simplicity of others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>8.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely happy with the Minister's answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill. There is a real problem here. The fixed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>367</span>
payment scheme will apply to the public defender system—the pilot project that the Minister has included in clause 45.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem with witnesses from abroad. We spoke to some lawyers earlier today who described a case in which the prosecution, which is publicly funded in Scotland—the procurator fiscal—was dealing with an offence of someone stealing two articulated lorries in France. They had been brought back to Glasgow and had been discovered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Eastwood, perhaps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in Eastwood. Perhaps they were discovered, in your own constituency, Mr Martin. It may have been Springburn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prosecution was concerned about taking proceedings against the person responsible, but it was discovered when his premises were searched that the fax machine there had been stolen from a local college, and so there was a series of charges. Because the procurators fiscal are so badly funded by the Government, they could not go to trial, so a deal was struck in which they forgot all about the two articulated lorries that had been stolen in France because that would have involved bringing witnesses in from France, Germany and other parts of the continent at great expense. They agreed to drop that charge if the defence would plead guilty to stealing the fax machine from the local college. That highlights the problem of allowing the Government to prescribe fixed sums for any public defender system for dealing with very serious cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that it may be possible to devise a scheme that will get enough money to bring witnesses from abroad if that is necessary. The clause gives the Minister the option of setting a prescribed list of fees that may preclude the bringing of witnesses from Germany and France in cases where serious crimes have been committed on the continent, but where the offender is brought to trial in Scotland. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that it may be possible to devise a scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the past I have heard the hon. Gentleman refer to motor and other crimes as lesser crimes for which people should not be gaoled. I suspect that for stealing a motor vehicle the punishment may be community service, perhaps for two or three months. Does the hon. Gentleman think that it is worth spending a heck of a lot of cash to get somebody two or three months' community service when they would probably get the same for stealing the fax machine?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman thinks that stealing two articulated lorries is the same as stealing a fax machine from a local college, particularly when the articulated lorries were probably full of booze and fags, which are worth a great deal. I should have thought that the Crown would be interested in pursuing such a case, but it was not because of a lack of money to bring in witnesses. That is what I am concerned about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>368</span>
The clause will allow a Tory Secretary of State for Scotland to limit the money available to defence lawyers and public defenders so that it may not be possible to bring witnesses from abroad. I am not happy about letting that through without challenging the Minister to give a guarantee that any defender—whether a public defender or a private lawyer—has the right to say that whatever the cost of bringing witnesses to defend a client, the state will make the money available. We need that assurance from the Minister before we pass the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill spoke about forensic experts but the Minister did not refer to that in his summing up. The public defender system comes into play in that context. At the moment, when a murder is committed the state brings in its own forensic expert to carry out the post mortem. It is looking for a conviction and the forensic expert knows that and will provide the evidence that is necessary to secure one. The defendant has a different perspective. He seeks an acquittal and will be keen to get an independent expert to carry out a second post mortem to make sure that his case can be properly presented in court. Anyone who is unfortunate enough to be involved in a pilot project in which there is a public defender system, may find that his public defender does not have the right to engage an independent forensic expert to perform a second post mortem because the public defender works for the state and has to accept whoever the state appoints through the procurator fiscal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must say that that will not happen and that money will be made available for second post mortems and for a completely independent forensic expert to be brought in on the side of the defence. Under prescribed fees that is not completely clear. If there is a prescribed system of fees and a lack of resources available to the defence, whether it consists of public defenders or private lawyers, there may be added pressure on the defence to do some sort of deal. In a recent case in which the hon. Member for Ayr will be interested where the procurators fiscal pursued two young lads who, appallingly, kicked somebody to death. However the procurators fiscal, after plea bargaining and because of lack of resources, lack of time and lack of support from the Government, accepted a verdict of culpable homicide. The lads were found guilty and sentenced to 18 months in gaol. The Lord Advocate then appealed and the appeal was heard in the High Court. The sentence was increased to six years. Again, this happened because of lack of resources. If the procurators fiscal had prosecuted the case in the first instance as strongly as they could, with sufficient money and without having to plea bargain, a six-year sentence might have been imposed and there would have been no need for the Lord Advocate to appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It comes back to resources. During the earlier debate Conservative Members all admitted that all of these changes had been brought in with one idea in mind—to cut the cost of criminal legal aid in the courts in Scotland. The only way they can do that is by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>369</span>
prejudicing the rights of the individuals who seek to defend themselves in those courts, and that is what concerns us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must give a detailed answer to the points that have been raised by Conservative members of the Committee before we allow the clause to go through unchallenged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To be fair to the Minister, I thought that he had given reassurances on the question of the cost of bringing witnesses from abroad, perhaps at great expense, and on the availability of a forensic expert for the defence. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East nevertheless pressed him on that point because we need to be absolutely certain about those two points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third issue that I want to raise is about having a fixed-payment system at all. How can we be certain that we are comparing like with like in terms of service for that fixed payment? One firm may give good value for a fixed payment in terms of true professional expertise while another might give a student or lawyers' clerk a task that a lawyer ought to be doing. Therefore, although they are charging the same fee, it is costing them less to do the job. That problem seems to relate to the whole issue of fixed fees. What kind of checks and balances would there be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification from the Minister as to why he thinks this system should be introduced. Is it because he believes that the existing system is being abused? If so, by whom and in what way is it being abused? Presumably the Government are presenting new legislation only on the understanding that there is a problem which requires to be addressed. It would be helpful to the Committee if the Minister spelt out the problem so that we may better examine whether this solution is appropriate in the circumstances. Like many others, I have been lobbied by the Glasgow Bar Association which is obviously concerned about the question of fixed fees. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If fixed fees are to be introduced this Association calls for the Bill to include provision for exceptionally difficult or lengthy or complex cases to be recognised and distinguished."</p></blockquote>
That is not an unreasonable point. However, the association slightly undermines its case by not recognising and not briefing us on the fact that simple and straightforward cases might actually be cheaper. That shows the direction in which the Glasgow Bar Association would move in these matters.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond first to the hon. Member for Dundee, East. The fixed fee issue is separate from the public defender scheme. The details of a fixed fee scheme are still to be worked out in consultation with the Law Society, but all that the clause does it to give the power to set fixed fees. The hon. Gentleman asked whether fixed fees would apply in the public defender scheme. Emphatically, they will not. Those concerned will have salaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
I return to the issue raised by the hon. Member for Maryhill about witnesses from France or America. There is no reason why procedures should change in respect of witnesses from abroad. If witnesses are necessary, they will be cited either by the prosecution or the defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked whether public defenders will be starved of funds to carry out the proper investigation. I do not accept that. The public defender will have a duty under the code of practice to carry out a proper investigation, including calling in independent experts, where appropriate. I repeat that, in the case of private solicitors, the arrangements for fixed fees could allow outlays such as the cost of independent experts to be funded separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that quality standards will be maintained; solicitors will still be required to meet their usual professional standards and I see no reason to expect that solicitors will do less than is necessary in the interests of the client.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East raised a particular case relating to prosecution, which is a wholly different issue. If he believes that that case was mishandled by the prosecution, it is appropriate for him to take it up with the Lord Advocate. In my view, however, it would not be reasonable for a prosecutor to refuse to prosecute on grounds of lack of resources. If there is a serious allegation to that affect, it should be taken up with the Lord Advocate as that is not the basis on which the prosecution service of Scotland operates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason for the amendment is that the provisions of new section 35A of the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986, inserted by clause 48, will create a new range of powers of investigation for the Scottish Legal Aid Board. Has the board demonstrated to the Minister the need for such powers and have solicitors failed to supply information or documents on demand? The clause places a severe constraint on solicitors and I should certainly not want it to be accepted without the Minister giving an adequate explanation of why it should be contained in the Bill. The amendment would ensure that the Scottish Legal Aid Board's investigation will need to go to court to obtain the requisite court order regarding the provision of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 286 would restrict new section 35A to information relating solely to criminal legal aid. Therefore, information that does not relate to criminal legal aid should not be passed to the Scottish Legal Aid Board. What are the Minister's feelings about the worries of the Law Society of Scotland and others, which say that the Scottish Legal Aid Board is not entitled to information that falls outwith its statutory duties?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society points out that the terms of the new section 35A(1) will allow the Scottish Legal Aid Board additional powers to request information or documents that have no relation to legal aid and will take the clause outwith the scope of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 287 is a consequential amendment, as are amendments Nos. 288 and 289.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 290 would ensure that the "duty of confidentiality" owed by a solicitor or any other person cannot be overridden by a request from the Scottish Legal Aid Board. The duty of confidentiality is central to any client/professional relationship. It can also be specifically constituted by the contract. As the duty is the basis of trust between clients and professionals, it should be overturned only in specific,
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
strictly regulated circumstances. It is inappropriate for adherence to a person's professional obligations to have penal consequences. The Minister knows that it is an important matter, because a number of people have made comments about the confidentiality aspect. I have received a letter from Andrew Hardie QC, the dean of the Faculty of Advocates, regarding clause 48 and its
	<br><blockquote><p>"provisions relating to the obtaining of information by the Scottish Legal Aid Board and the powers of entry of the Board to search premises and take possesion of documents."</p></blockquote>
He states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While I do not condone fraudulent claims by solicitors or anyone else, I am concerned that the powers being conferred upon the Board are Draconian and raise matters of principle. The provisions in the new Clause 35A of the 1986 Act authorise the Board to require a solicitor or firm to provide information at any stage. Furthermore, the failure to provide that information constitutes a criminal offence. It is not a defence to claim confidentiality. This causes me concern because it is essential that clients know that they may confide in their legal advisers without third parties having access to such confidences. This is all the more important where the confidential information can be ascertained by the Board prior to the conclusion of the trial. This provision seems to me to confer upon the Board greater powers than those possessed by the police who are the appropriate body to investigate alleged criminal activity.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The power of entry provisions contained in the new Clause 35B of the 1986 Act can be criticised on the same basis because the solicitor is obliged to produce documents and to provide explanations nothwithstanding any duty of confidentiality to his client. Again this requirement may be made by the Board prior to the conclusion of the trial.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I would ask you to give serious consideration to deleting these provisions as I consider that the police and the Law Society of Scotland currently have adequate powers to investigate alleged fraud."</p></blockquote>
He adds, and I agree, that he has
	<br><blockquote><p>"no difficulty with the power conferred upon the Board of suspending a solicitor from providing criminal legal assistance or withholding payment of fees pending the outcome of investigations by the Law Society of Scotland, the police and the procurator fiscal. I am aware that some people have suggested that this power is contrary to the presumption of innocence but you will be aware that I have such powers when a serious complaint of misconduct is reported to me."</p></blockquote>
I agree entirely with the dean of the Faculty of Advocates. If there is a suspicion of anyone filching the system, the payments must be stopped as a result. If there is a cloud of suspicion over an individual in a local authority or anywhere else, that person should be suspended. The Scottish Legal Aid Board should not keep giving money to individuals while there is cloud over their affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One must assume that the Board will have some substantial basis for making a complaint to the Law Society of Scotland or the police or the procurator fiscal and will not act maliciously. In these circumstances I do not see why the Board should be required to authorise further certificates to, or to pay for the past services of, a solicitor suspected of fraud. The powers contained in new Clause 35C appear to me to be reasonably necessary to protect the interests of the Board."</p></blockquote>
So there are still some problems with clause 48. I know that Government amendment No. 278 is designed to assist as it will limit new section 35A powers of investigation to solicitors. However, the issue of professional duties of confidentiality can still be overridden. For example, if a doctor's report or a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>373</span>
Member of Parliament's correspondence is in the possession of a solicitor or an accountant, and the patient, client or constituent is owed a duty of confidentiality, all those documents can be accessed by the Scottish Legal Aid Board under that new section 35A. The Government should seriously reconsider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no Government amendment to new section 35B, referring to powers of search, which still applies warrants and powers of search to "any person" and allows searches to be conducted in "any premises". New section 35B could therefore apply to doctors, Members of Parliament or accountants who request information from a solicitor. It seems that the Scottish Legal Aid Board could ask us to hand over such documents, notwithstanding the duty of confidentiality that exists between a solicitor and his client.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under new section 35B, the duty of confidentiality is potentially a criminal offence. Given the heavyweight comments that have been made against the clause, not least those of the Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, I ask the Minister to look seriously at the matter in his summing up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have sympathy with some of the comments made by the hon. Member for Dumbarton. I ask my right hon. Friend to clarify the impact of Government amendment No. 278. Some comments about amendment No. 228 would also be worthwhile. I am anxious that access to files could extend beyond solicitors to General Practioners, accountants, Members of Parliament and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two points come to mind in respect of amendments Nos. 219 and 222. Amendment No. 222 seeks to leave out the words "or partly" from new section 35A(1), which involves documents that relate wholly or partly to the provision of criminal legal aid. If such documents relate only partly to that provision, what is the other part? Are we talking of civil legal aid? If so, we should come clean about it and make that statement clearly in the Bill. New section 35A should deal with criminal legal assistance only. One that basis, I query the words "or partly".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 219 suggests adding the words "on cause shown" to new section 35A, so that it would state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Board may on cause shown require any solicitor or firm to produce such information".</p></blockquote>
One would expect the solicitor or the Legal Aid Board to demonstrate clearly why such documents were being sought. Adding the words "on cause shown" would have some value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly support the idea that if a solicitor obtains public funds by fraud or deception, that should be investigated and dealt with. However, I have some questions about matters of detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a warrant is sought to remove documents from a solicitor's premises, who would do the removing? The Bill provides that it would be done by an authorised person. Often when documents are removed from a
	<span class='label label-info column'>374</span>
person's premises by the police, far more documents are taken than are required because the police genuinely find it difficult to distinguish between those documents that are strictly relevant and those that are not. There might even be an entire document clearance, which would harm the confidentiality requirement of other clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How would the removal of such documents be carried out? Would the warrant be obtained from a sheriff or a justice of the peace—or would it not matter? I should not have expected fraud to be so widespread that such an elaborate system would be needed. I can hear mutterings from hon. Friends sitting near me that it possibly is, yet very few prosecutions have been brought. We have to be on our guard against the possibility of frauds being committed in this way. At the same time we must safeguard the interests of a solicitor's clients who could be detrimentally caught up in the investigation of a fraud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if the Minister explained why so much attention is being paid to this matter. The notes on clauses state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no evidence to suggest that widespread fraud of the legal aid system in Scotland exists, but it is important that the potential for it is reduced and those who abuse the system are identified. The Board currently tackles this through various measures. It can, however, encounter difficulty in obtaining sufficient supporting evidence and the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986 does not provide strong enough powers to resolve such difficulties. The Board's powers for investigating the practices of solicitors therefore require strengthening."</p></blockquote>
That assumes substantial difficulty. I am aware that amendment No. 187, which was tabled by the hon. Members for Eastwood and for Ayr, would require lawyers to undertake a course in professional ethics. That gives us cause for concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister quantify the scale on which he believes that fraud is taking place? If the problem is not substantial, are such draconian powers justified? If they are, should not the Minister make the scale of those difficulties known and propose other solutions to tackle the problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendment No. 308 and ask the Minister to clarify precisely what, in new section 35A, he sees as the difference between subsection (1) and, separately, subsections (2) and (3). Subsection (1) provides that the board may require any solicitor or firm to produce such information, but subsections (2) and (3) refer to authorising any of the board's officers. Will the Minister clarify why that distinction was necessary? When I examined the Bill the reason was not clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of a draconian power is being proposed. I wish to comment on the fact that the phraseology in subsection (1) means that it will relate to criminal work—which may include civil cases—and so it will extend widely. It is not uncommon for civil cases, particularly divorce cases, to involve elements of criminal work as well. There is no provision for a reasonable suspicion test, which the Scottish Legal Aid Board could use in exercising its discretion. Does that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>375</span>
mean that random checks may be done instead of checks on the basis of apprehension that something is amiss in a particular firm?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the debate. First I shall respond to the question as to whether a solicitor's duty of confidentiality can be overriden by the board's power. The board already has access to documents such as counsel's opinion and I envisage no new problem for the board. The existing powers require confidentiality by the board under section 34 of the 1986 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton asked about what happens if the solicitor has a report from the doctor in his own office. It is crucial to consider why the board would require access to documents. If the documents relate to criminal legal assistance, the board should have access to them. If they do not, there is no reason for the board to be interested in them. That applies whatever the nature of the document in question. The board's officials will be trained and experienced in identifying the documents that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may develop these points before the hon. Gentleman intervenes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 278, of course, clarifies that only partners, former partners or employees of solicitors or firms and their ex-employees may be affected by the exercise of these powers. There is no question of clients, medical staff, surveyors or anyone else being required to produce documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also draw the Committee's attention to amendments Nos. 279 and 280. These are simply intended to clarify that there is no distinction under section 35A(1) and (4), in that in both cases the provision about lien will apply. It may also be helpful if I comment on the fundamental reason for including the provisions relating to the powers of investigation in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The taxpayer, through the Scottish Legal Aid Board, provides substantial sums annually to meet the costs of criminal legal assistance. We do not doubt that the majority of practitioners earn the sums that they claim. However, there is scope in the current system for sums to be claimed which are not fairly earned. In the worst cases, there is outright fraud, although that is very rare. In other cases, there may be a tendency to undertake work that is not strictly necessary, but this is extremely hard to challenge on the present information available to the board. I am glad to say that the Law Society and the board have collaborated on an exercise on scrutiny of accounts, which has established that the board carries out that task to a very high standard. The board is always vigilant for unnecessary and unjustified claims on the legal aid
	<span class='label label-info column'>376</span>
fund, and solicitors generally accept that some accounts will be abated. The board can and does request the client's file where there is a need to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty lies in matters where excessive claims are not evident from single accounts, but where the board suspects there may be systematic incurring of unnecessary expense. There are several steps to be gone through before the board would seek to exercise the powers in section 35A. First, the board would have to carry out an exercise to identify discrepancies not evident from individual accounts. Then, the board would have to analyse the information in a number of accounts from one solicitor or firm. Next, the board would have had to fail to resolve any anomalies through the voluntary co-operation of the solicitor or firm. Finally, the board would have to conclude that only documents held on the premises of the solicitor or firm would be of use in resolving the anomalies, and that it must compel the production of these documents. The board must have good reason for the exercise of these powers, and I hope that what I have said helps to explain what might be meant by "good reason".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will readily be seen that the honest solicitor and the honest firm have nothing to fear from these powers. The board proposes to employ only two investigators and there are nearly 2,000 solicitors providing criminal legal assistance. The investigators will be able to target only those firms or solicitors that present real cause for concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth and Kinross raised the issue of the reasonable suspicion test. There is no need for such a test; these powers are to be used to monitor compliance with the code of practice, as well as to obtain any other information the board requires to carry out its functions. The board would normally expect solicitors to provide information on request. This provision provides statutory backing for the board's right to ask for documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another context in which the board could use the powers contained in section 35A: to investigate compliance with the code of conduct. However, it is expected that those solicitors and firms that aspire to be registered would be willing to comply voluntarily with the board's requests for information. If they do not, their suitability for continued registration must be in doubt. Against the background of those opening remarks, I shall now turn to the individual amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be reluctant to accept amendments Nos. 288 and 289, which would introduce a judicial hearing into the procedure whereby the board would require the production of documents. As I have already indicated, that step would be taken only where there was no way of securing the necessary information through voluntary compliance. A judicial hearing would delay the process when time might be an important factor in preventing further abuse of the legal aid fund. I would, therefore, urge the Committee to reject the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Amendment No. 222 would preclude the board being able to require a solicitor or firm to produce, or the board being able to take possession of, a document dealing only partly with criminal legal assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 222 would preclude the board being able to require a solicitor or firm to produce, or the board being able to take possesion of, a document dealing only partly with criminial legal assistance. There are documents in this category such as the court diary of engagement diary which provide important information about how solicitors have divided their time between legally aided cases, and which will also include information on non-legally aided cases. It is unacceptable that the board should be denied access to such information and I must therefore resist the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 290 and 292 would allow a solicitor to claim confidentiality in refusing to provide documents to the board. The board has a statutory obligation to maintain confidentiality in its dealings with applicants for legal aid and I see no reason to expect the board to fail in its responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In terms of confidentiality, is it not relevant to the duty of confidentiality that it is an offence for a Scottish Leagl Aid Board employee to breach the statutory obligation of confidentiality?

The hon. Gentleman asked about new section 35B to the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986. It must follow requests for information made under new section 35A. That section is limited as a result of amendment No. 278 to solicitors' firms and their employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On confidentiality of information, clause 34 of the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (2) below, no information furnished for the purposes of this Act to the Board or to any person acting on its behalf shall be disclosed."</p></blockquote>
The clause continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person … in contravention of this subsection" will be</p></blockquote>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of amendment No. 229 is to ensure that only a sheriff can grant a warrant for power of entry by the Scottish Legal Aid Board. As Members on both sides have said, the powers of entry and investigation are considerable. They should be exercised only after appropriate judicial intervention by a sheriff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Comparable powers are those of the Customs and Excise and of the Inland Revenue. The power to call for documents or the papers of a tax accountant can be allowed only with the consent of a sheriff. Entering
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>379</span>
premises with a warrant to obtain documents must also be done with a sheriff's consent. A sheriff may issue a warrant if he is satisifed, on information given on oath by an officer of the Board of the Inland Revenue, that there are reasonable grounds for expecting that an offence involving fraud has been committed, of which evidence can be found on the premises in question, and that the officer is acting with the board's approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's new powers are comparable. It is not appropriate that those could be exercised soley on the say-so of a JP given the width of the powers. A sheriff should be involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned this point earlier. A person holding a warrant can search premises named in a warrant and take possession of documents. I want to know how that works in practice. If a constable or police officer held the warrant, how could he be certain that he was taking the relevant documents, and nothing but the relevant documents? To say that he can take anything that appears to him to relate wholly or partly to criminal or legal assistance is sweeping—he might empty the entire office. How does it actually work? It seems a difficult thing for the police to do. If it is not the police who carry out this task, who does?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 293 deletes new section 35B(1)(c) and (d). The new section provides for powers of entry to be given to the Scottish Legal Aid Board on application to a sheriff or justice of the peace. The powers can be given if the board has reasonable suspicion that an offence has been committed in relation to legal aid or a solicitor is attempting to recover money to which he is not entitled. There is no problem with those two points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the section adds that the power can be given if a solicitor is not complying with the code of practice or if documents have been requested under section 35A. The amendment deletes those two provisions and limits the obtainable warrant of entry to those circumstances in which an offence has been committed or there are analogous circumstances. It is inappropriate for the same important procedures to apply to a crime as to a manner of book keeping. I seek the Minister's comments on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 294 would ensure that police constables shall be persons authorised to execute a search warrant obtained by the Scottish Legal Aid Board. They have long experience of executing search warrants, and professional expertise. It has been suggested by the Law Society and others that the Scottish Legal Aid Board investigators do not have that experience and expertise; the amendment highlights that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the board apprehends a person at the moment that a crime is being committed, is not it the case that it can notify the police and arrange for a police warrant to be granted, rather than taking on the matter itself?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 295, 296, 297 are consequential, as is amendment No. 298, which deletes the absolute duty to provide explanations in documents; that
	<span class='label label-info column'>380</span>
overrides the duty of confidentiality. There is a legacy of confidentiality and we want to ensure that that professional duty remains inviolate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments arise from concerns about confidentiality and the apparently draconian powers being introduced under section 35B.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak first to amendment No. 309, which would effectively transfer the powers proposed for the Legal Aid Board to the Law Society. The power of the Scottish Legal Aid Board to enter the premises of solicitors and others would be transferred to the Law Society of Scotland, which is the disciplinary body for solicitors in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society of Scotland has existing powers of intervention into solicitor's premises under section 38 of the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1980. I will not go into the section in detail, but it does not have the broad powers proposed for the Scottish Legal Aid Board. It certainly could not undertake the kind of investigation being proposed in the Bill. If the Government are minded to insist that such an investigation be continued, at the very least the amendment would enable the Law Society of Scotland to do it, at no cost to the taxpayer, which is an important matter for the Government to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 310 is a consequential amendment. Amendment No. 311 deletes part of a paragraph of new section 35B, leaving out the example given in subsection (b). The provision of examples in measures such as this is unusual. Examples are given in some legislation, but the general rule of construction effectively states that if one example is included, it is taken to exclude others. In the context of the Bill, that would seem almost to be limiting it to that example and nothing else. Can the Minister clarify the position?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the general question, a solicitor is at present under a duty to prepare and conduct criminal legal aid cases by carrying out work that is actually and reasonably necessary and having due regard to economy. That is in the Law Society's code of conduct for criminal work. It derives from regulation 7(1) of the Criminal Legal Aid Fees Regulations 1987. A solicitor's primary duties are to the court and to his client. Each solicitor is expected to carry out his duties responsibly and professionally. With that uppermost, solicitors must not abuse the legal aid system and view cases only as a means of financial enrichment. Can the Minister explain why complaints cannot be dealt with under section 31 of the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986 instead of the Bill's proposals? Avenues seem to exist that do not necessitate the type of draconian powers proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 312 effectively excludes noncompliance with the Scottish Legal Aid Board's code of conduct as a ground for the exercise of powers of entry. The reason is that the powers of entry are extreme. The new provisions ensure that powers of entry can be applied for if the Legal Aid Board has grounds for suspicion about an alleged crime committed by a solicitor, legal aid fraud, possession of documents needed by the board and/or noncompliance with the code of conduct. The powers are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>381</span>
unnecessary because the Legal Aid Board has never informed the Law Society of Scotland that it has reported a solicitor to the police for the purposes of a search warrant—which is what it would at present be required to do. The chairman of the Legal Aid Board has stated that there is no widespread fraud in the legal profession. So I am wondering what all this is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers in the proposed section 35B especially seem disproportionate because the association of criminal behaviour with what is effectively noncompliance book-keeping seems like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is a practising solicitor. How easy is it for fraud to occur under present legislation, and does she think that there is fraud?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is incorrect. I have not been a practising solicitor for some time. I, too, was once employed by Ross, Harper and Murphy. I was also instructed by them as counsel. My experience in private practice as a solicitor was confined to one year, so I would hardly be regarded an expert on the preparation of accounts for legal aid from a solicitor's point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From my experience as counsel, it was almost unheard of for people to fake claims to the Legal Aid Board, which is what we are really talking about. When we speak about fraud, we are effectively saying that people are submitting accounts for work not done. In my experience, that does not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My only reason for mentioning it is that today a solicitor said to me, "We know who the bandits are" and, "The system has been filched." If that is so, a report should be made to the Law Society so that something can be done. It is inadequate for us as politicians to hear statements such as that and then be told that there is nothing wrong with the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman. I would hardly be telling the truth if I did not admit that I had heard rumours. The hon. Gentleman asked about my direct experience. The two are different. One always hears rumours about all types of businesses. Whether or not the rumours are substantiated by evidence is another matter. The more frequently expressed concern is that work hitherto regarded as part and parcel of the preparation of cases for court will now be difficult to do on account of the fees available to solicitors. Corners may be cut because they know that they will not be paid for their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will sympathise with me, in that I made the most of my legal aid claims as counsel, and we seem to be excluded from the provision. That makes it difficult for me to comment on individual cases, but in my experience as counsel I have never come across solicitors who put in accounts for work that did not take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been said, the police already have the powers provided for under the clause, but I do not know of a case in which the Scottish Legal Aid Board has requested those powers to be exercised; strict tests
	<span class='label label-info column'>382</span>
would, of course, need to be applied. Given that such a request has never been made, why is the measure necessary now unless it is expected that the test that will be applied under the clause will be nowhere near as rigorous as the test applied by the police? Will the Minister comment on that, as it is extraordinary for a test to be imposed on one set of businesses that would not be applicable in other circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 313 is consequential. Amendment No. 314 would limit the exercise of a search warrant. It is a probing amendment, as I want the Minister to explain what a search of a solicitor's premises would achieve. How far will such a search go, and what does he expect will be discovered?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final and most detailed of the amendments—amendment No. 317—would, if the draconian approach is adopted, require a court to give a ruling before an entry is made. Under the proposed new sections, there will be penal consequences for noncompliance with the Legal Aid Board's request for information. Several hon. Members have expressed concern about the duty to uphold confidentiality because the measure might it make a crime. Most people recognise the importance of that duty, which is not only held by solicitors, but is common to a number of professions. It is best expressed in the solicitors' code of conduct, which imposes a duty in private law for confidentiality between the client and the solicitor. That doctrine of professional legal privilege has been recognised by the European Court of Justice, although I know that, for some Conservative Members, my saying that might be a red rag to a bull. Scots law does not make the distinction between public and private law, but the Law Society of Scotland, among others, does not believe that in litigation the concept of confidentiality owed by a solicitor to a client affects the conclusions reached by Scottish courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present situation seems to be encompassed in section 34 of the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986, which recognises and puts into statutory form the position that I have outlined. Indeed, as the hon. Member for Dumbarton said, that section makes it a criminal offence for an employee of the Scottish Legal Aid Board or someone acting on behalf of the board to disclose information furnished for the purposes of an application for legal aid or advice and assistance. The section makes the disclosure of the specified information to anyone an offence; on the face of it, therefore, it would be a crime to dislose such information to the police or to the procurator fiscal because the crime seems to be absolute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not seem to be the intention of the Bill to repeal section 34 of the 1986 Act; how can the proposed sections can happily co-exist with section 34 if it is not to be repealed? While section 34 recognised the confidentiality of information furnished to a solicitor by a client in a legal aid case, the proposed sections will make it a crime for the solicitor to refuse to breach that common law and statutory duty and thereby they seem to set up an odd set of circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>383</span>
I hope that the the Minister will address some of those issues. He will have realised that the issue of confidentiality is one of great concern and may extend beyond the solicitor's office and the files. I hope that he will clarify the expected practical exercise of the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>9.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood on having made a persuasive case for amendment No. 229, which would restrict to a sheriff the granting of a warrant for entry to premises. I agree with the principle of what he said and am minded to accept the amendment; I shall therefore return with an amendment on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maryhill asked how we can be sure that relevant documents will be taken. The officers of the board will be able to recognise relevant material and distinguish it from other material and that process should not cause unnecessary disruption or intrusion. The hon. Member for Perth and Kinross seeks through several amendments to transfer to the Law Society the powers of investigation, but we believe that it is the board's responsibility to exercise stewardship of the legal aid fund and that it is the right body to undertake investigations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 231 would preclude the board from being able to require a solicitor or firm to produce, or the board to take possession of, a document; I have explained that diaries can give key evidence, but can also relate to other matters. We believe that the board should not be denied access to such information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 230 would remove section 35B and prevent the board from seeking a warrant to enter premises to take possession of documents in certain circumstances. I appreciate that that is a controversial provision, but we believe that it is necessary to give the board that power to ensure that it can investigate matters where neither voluntary co-operation nor compliance with requirements under section 35A is forthcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment Nos. 294 and 295 would require a police officer to exercise the warrant issued by a sheriff. I do not believe that it is correct to involve the police in that manner and see no reason why the board cannot exercise that power. In the very few cases where it is necessary to exercise the power, it will be necessary for those conducting a search to be familiar with the material they are examining. It would be inappropriate and unfair to impose that burden on the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>384</span>
Amendment Nos. 297 and 298 would curtail the effectiveness of a warrant issued by a sheriff to seek out information. It is in the public interest that the warrant issued by a sheriff be able to ask the whereabouts of any missing documents or explain the purpose of those already identified. Only in that way can a full picture be obtained of a solicitor's activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment Nos. 314 and 316 would effectively mean that all the board could do under a warrant would be to copy documents. That, combined with other amendments, would effectively remove the board's power to exercise a warrant. I have already stated my firm belief that the board needs those powers and I ask the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross not to press the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 317 would add a judicial review into the process of deciding whether papers are confidential. Such a review is unnecessary because the board is already prohibited from breaching confidentiality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 319 proposes to remove the power of the board to retain documents and the penalties for obstruction of a board officer exercising powers under a warrant. The provisions to put a time limit on the retention of papers are proper, but I am not clear how the board could operate sensibly without retaining documents. It is normal that the obstruction of such statutory powers should attract offences and penalties. Otherwise, there is no sanction. I ask my hon. Friend not to press the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses say clearly what I have already said. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in Scotland of the legal aid system. However, it is important to reduce the potential for it. The board tackles that through various measures, but it may encounter difficulty in obtaining sufficient supporting evidence. The powers in the clause will enable the best working practices to be followed throughout Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
