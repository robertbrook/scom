	<div class='member'> Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 16 deals with rates of tax and tax allowances. We want to raise the issue of how the married couples allowance will operate under the comparatively new system of independent taxation. Although that new system represents far greater independence and privacy for marital partners than the previous system, discrimination on the grounds of sex still persists at the edges. Only the husband can receive the married couples allowance and only if he cannot use in full the allowance can he transfer part of it to his wife. A man and woman may receive the same pay, but the man will have the greater take-home pay solely because of his sex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 46 and 47 raise some of the issues arising from that difficulty. In our response to the Budget, we said that the obvious and ideal solution would be to leave to the discretion of the couple how to split the allowance, but we realise that the Inland Revenue might be less than delighted by the administrative problems that such a proposal might cause. As it is ever our wish to keep life as simple as possible for the Inland Revenue so that it can raise the largest amount of tax revenue that is due, amendments Nos. 46 and 47 put forward more simple proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss amendment No. 47 first because, in a sense, it is more straight forward. It would permit a man to elect how to treat the married couples allowance. He may choose to give all of it to his wife, if the couple decides that that is right, or to divide it equally between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 46 is perhaps a little more radical, but none the worse for that. The amendments are similar in some respects, as they permit the transfer of the whole or part of the allowance. Amendment No. 46 allows for half of the allowance to pass to the wife if she so wishes and notifies the Revenue that that is her choice—irrespective of whether her husband consents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move the amendment not only because it is morally right to treat couples equally, but because a couple may be in dispute. Separation or divorce may be pending. They may not be able to agree about how the married couples allowance should be divided. The amendment would help to overcome the problem of a wife being denied access to half of that allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important issue is irrevocability. Amendment No. 46 states that if an election were made under our proposals, it would be "irrevocable", as the Revenue prefers. However, it remains right to deal with the issue in the way proposed by amendment No. 47: to allow the revoking of such an election at least once. We understand the administrative problems that might be created by such a proposal, which is why this option should be permitted only once. The issue should be raised, although it is separate from the problem of the transferability of part or all of the married couples allowance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Norman Lamont)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) has raised an issue that was debated when we considered independent taxation. I have some sympathy with her case, but the Government do not believe that it would be right to implement the amendments. I sympathise
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
with her objectives. As she says, there are rough edges. At the end of the day, we may have to compromise on our aims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would introduce two new options for the married couples allowance. At present, only the part— if any—of the married couples allowance that the husband is unable to use himself may be transferred to the wife. The amendments would give a husband a new option to transfer the allowance in full to his wife, whether or not he could use it against his own income. There is a further option, which would be available only where neither the existing option to transfer surplus allowance, nor the proposed new option to transfer the allowance in full was taken. That would invoke a 50:50 split of the allowance between husband and wife. The amendments are alternatives: either the wife by amendment No. 46 or the husband by amendment No. 47, could exercise this option. That is the key difference between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with the spirit of the amendments. As my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said in the Budget debates, the Government have looked carefully at how the married couples allowance should be allocated between husbands and wives. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) may remember that we debated that matter in Committee last year. I understand why the hon. Member for Derby, South argues that it would be desirable to allow couples to choose how the allowance should be split between them, but in practice, there would be substantial drawbacks to any system that allowed such flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present system is simple and straightforward implementing the options proposed by the hon. Lady would require every husband and wife to understand them. Those options are complex, although I do not wish to stress that. Eighty per cent. of taxpayers are dealth with through pay-as-you-earn. Moving away from a system where 80 per cent. of taxpayers are not making a return, are not dealing with the Revenue, and are handled through PAYE, would be a retrograde step. If the amendments were accepted, married couples would have to be informed about the new options and be given the chance to choose them if they wished. The Inland Revenue would have to ensure that both the husband's and wife's tax offices which deal with each other only occasionally under independent taxation, made the necessary adjustments to their records. Procedures would have to be set up to deal with couples who wanted to change their decisions later, for example as suggested by the hon. Lady, because their income during the year turned out to be more, or less, than they had expected. That would carry a cost in extra staff and extra worry about the options for millions of married couples whose tax affairs are at present very straightforward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Few people fill in a tax return—the administrative difficulties must be balanced against that fact. Notwithstanding the disaggregation of savings income, and given that many taxpayers will have basic rate tax deducted from it we do not expect a huge increase in the number of people who will have to deal with the Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Few taxpaying married couples—less than 1 per cent. of the total, or about 50,000—would be better off under the proposals. They would be couples where the wife paid tax at the higher rate and the husband was a basic rate taxpayer, with joint incomes of between £25,000 and
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
£45,000 a year. I am glad that the hon. Lady sometimes worries about people with annual incomes of up to £45,000. Other couples would be no better or worse off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, therefore two main objections to the amendments. They would cause administrative difficulties and few couples would benefit from the change. The legislation does not provide full independence, but it gives complete privacy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand the Chief Secretary to claim that the amendments would benefit only one in 50,000 people—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, 50,000 couples.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and that they would be people whose combined income, by definition, is over £45,000?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'> Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not over £45,000, but joint incomes of between £25,000 and £45,000, where the husband pays basic rate tax and the wife pays at a higher rate. Fewer than 1 per cent. of married couples would benefit. Both options detract from the privacy that independent taxation will provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Few couples would gain financialy from the options put forward by the hon. Member for Derby, South but many would have to exchange information about their incomes to ensure that they got the maximum benefit from the allowance. Under the system as it stands, a wife never has to disclose her income to her husband. The hon. Lady may be surprised by the fact that when in the Green Paper, we suggested transferable allowances, we found that many of the representations that we received argued for complete privacy so that people could order their tax affairs without having to disclose their incomes to their spouse. Some may regard that as a hardline and extreme position, but it was one of the major arguments against transferable allowances, which would have allowed people more flexibility in maximising tax advantages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have examined various options for allowing couples more flexibility in how they use the married couples allowance, but, as I have explained, we do not believe that a change would achieve benefits for couples that would be worth the additional costs and complexity involved, especially as few taxpayers would receive any real benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present rules ensure that neither husbands not wives will have their tax thresholds reduced by the introduction of independent taxation and that couples with sufficient income between them to make use of the married couples allowance will get its full benefit. Permitting the allowance to be transferred only to the extent that a husband has insufficient income to use it avoids administrative complexity as far as possible. I fully concede to the hon. Member for Derby, South that the present arrangements are not perfect. They do not satisfy everyone, but they are straightforward. The case for introducing to the tax system the further complexity that the amendments would involve is not strong enough. I have every sympathy with what the hon. Lady has proposed, but the benefits would not be commensurate with the costs. The present system is the best that we can currently hope for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Due to my attendance at the debate on the Employment Bill on Thursday, I was unable to attend the Committee's first

	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
meeting. However grand this Committee Room may be, I find the acoustics very difficult. I tried my best to follow the remarks of the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the hon. Lady's amendment to the extent that it is designed to ensure proper equality and independent taxation of spouses. I recognise the de minimis argument that the Chief Secretary put forward. I guessed, and was pleased to receive confirmation from the Chief Secretary, that one reason for the amendment is that those who would benefit from it would be couples with joint incomes between £25,000 and £40,000. No doubt the printing press at Walworth Road is running now, putting out press releases to reassure those with high incomes that the Labour party is on their side and that it is the wicked Tories who stand in the way of this concession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Knowing that the matter was to be debated, my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) showed me a letter that he received this week from a constituent about a practical problem that arises from the transferability, or non-transferablility, of the married couples allowance. It would be unfair to name the person, but I shall explain the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The husband of the couple has been out of work for some time but has an unearned income and his wife is working. Prior to 6 April, the income tax allowance was being transferred to the wife and set off against her earned income. Since the beginning of this tax year, the new law has been interpreted in such a way that the tax inspector is setting off the married couples allowance against the husband's unearned income. As the constituent of my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Up until now his personal allowance has been transferred to me to utilise against my salary, but as of 6 April 1990, his personal allowance is being set off against his investment income, most of which is paid to him net of tax. This effectively means that we are actually worse off by the new legislation as he can only utilise a small amount of his allowances against some of his investment income, which is paid to him gross".</p></blockquote>
I rather suspect that that couple will not lose out under the new system. If tax has already been paid, there should be a rebate, but if that is not the case, it is another reason for seriously considering the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Derby South, as people on relatively low income may be disadvantaged through the new regime. An opportunity to transfer the allowance would help couples in that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Chief Secretary consider introducing a mechanism whereby people who are due for a rebate do not have to wait to receive it? Tax inspectors could operate the new system so that a couple's income would continue at the level that they previously enjoyed. For people on low incomes, knowing that they will receive some money in the future does not necessarily reassure them when it comes to meeting current bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that there is an administrative problem here and any reassurance on the matter would be welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to look into the case that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) has raised. It sounds like a consequence of composite rate taxation and will be ameliorated by abolishing CRT. If the hon. Gentleman will give me details of the case, I shall look into it and write to him about what can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
As I said in response to the hon. Member for Derby South, (Mrs. Beckett), those who would benefit from the proposal would be couples with joint incomes of up to £45,000, when one of them pays tax at the higher rate and the other pays at the basic rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland is describing and interaction with CRT, I shall consider the facts of the case. I am delighted to see the hon. Gentleman in the Committee and am looking forward to my holiday in his constituency next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with considerable interest to the Chief Secretary's response. We recognise that a comparatively small group of people would benefit from the amendment. This is a turn-round from the usual position. Ministers usually oppose amendments when many people would be affected. Ministers normally say that as many people would be affected by a proposal, it would cost far too much to introduce so they cannot accept it. On this occasion, the Chief Secretary is saying that far too few people would be affected by the proposal, so it is not worth the time and trouble of introducing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, perhaps mistakenly, taken seriously the Government's description of what they were seeking to do with independent taxation, which included equality of treatment. As the Chief Secretary generously accepted, the system does not provide equality of treatment. As I pointed out earlier, two couples whose income is the same—except that in one case the husband receives the lower income and in the other the wife does—would not be treated the same with regard to their tax liability. That seems undesirable and not what the Government claim that they are trying to achieve. We wanted to assist them by tabling the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I followed the Chief Secretary's argument with great care. We of course accept his first comment that only a small group would be affected by the amendment. He then said that one of the administrative complications that would cause difficulty would be the couple changing their election. In amendment No. 46, we suggest that the election should be irrevocable, so that difficulty does not arise. He also said that although the amendment might achieve in a purer form the Government's principle of equality of treatment, it would breach one of the Government's other principles, which is to allow complete privacy in tax treatment so that a wife need never disclose her income to her husband. Under amendment No. 46, that would not be necessary because the wife could simply write to the Revenue to ask for half the married couples allowance, which it would give her. Why she wanted it and a discussion of levels of income need not arise if it was a potential source of difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have disposed of two of the Minister's three objections to amendment No. 46. The only one that remains is that it would not make a great deal of difference and that only a few people who would be disadvantaged and would not get equality of treatment under the present system would be helped by it. This is a moderate, sensible and reasonable amendment which will improve what the Government are trying to do and I ask my hon. Friends to vote for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to detain the Committee long, but there are two other issues that I should like to raise. I should like to draw attention to an issue that was raised in our starred amendment No. 59. I understand that you did not have time to call it, Mr. Cormack.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Besides the group comprising low-earning husbands with higher-earning wives, another group of taxpayers will lose out under the new system of independent taxation. In it, the woman is beteween 65 and 75 and the husband is younger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new system, an individual will get a larger personal allowance if he or she is over 65, and larger again if over 75, and there will be a larger married couple's allowance if either is over that age, but unless the person with the income is the older, the total relief given will be less than it would have been under the old system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference is between £6,000, or thereabouts, of allowances in this year, tax being paid at 25 per cent. on a gross income of £10,000, whereas under the new system the allowance is potentially just under £5,000 and tax is paid on a different scale of net income. The effect is to reduce the free income for a couple in that position—say a 63-year-old man with an income of £10,000 a year and an older wife— from £9,000 to £8,742.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first reaction to that anomaly was to think that the Government had made an error, but as the Government have allowed a transitional relief for such couples, they presumably recognised the effect of the measure but decided nevertheless to reduce the income of a couple in such circumstances. Irrespective of whether that is desirable, does the Chief Secretary realise that such a couple are liable to lose out under the benefit system? One of the most resented anomalies that occurs in the treatment of pensioners is where the wife is more than 60, and sometimes more than 65, but the husband has not reached the age of 65. If the wife has not had an opportunity to build up full entitlement to a state pension on her own account, she cannot draw a dependant's pension until her husband is 65. Sometimes that is a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
From experience at my advice bureau and in my previous capacity when I shadowed social security I can assure the Chief Secretary that that anomaly is bitterly resented, especially by women who are much older than their husbands and know that they must wait a long time before drawing a retirement pension. A further anomalous discrimination is undesirable, and I should like to know the justification for it. As transitional relief is to be given, I assume that the Government intended those women to lose out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue arises not from the introduction of independent taxation but from an aspect of changes made in the Budget that it would be wrong to ignore. I shall touch on it only briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The non-indexation of the basic rate band represents a rise in tax liability for people paying tax at 40 per cent. It might be assumed that members of the Labour party would not strongly object to that, but we object to dishonesty. The Government have said very little about the impact of not increasing the basic rate band and it is just possible that the reason is that Members of Parliament are among those who will be affected. I hope that Conservative Members are listening, as the impact is likely to be greatest in households where only the husband works and earns some £27,000 a year. The lack of indexation of the basic rate band will cost such a person £5 a week, or £250 a year. That is the equivalent, for people in those circumstances, of about a penny on the basic rate of tax. It would be wrong to leave clause 16 without drawing the Committee's attention to the Government's decision to raise taxation in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be wrong to leave this clause without touching on the Government's record over the past decade on taxation matters in general, and especially on their wholly fraudulent claims to be the party of low taxation.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the present deputy Prime Minister was then the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In his Budget speech he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Excessive rates of income tax bear a heavy responsibility for the lack-lustre performance of the British economy. We need, therefore, to cut income tax at all levels." — [
	<i>Official Report,</i> 12 June 1979; Vol. 968, c.258.]</p></blockquote>
What has really happened? Leaving aside a few technical changes to the basic rate, the burden of taxation on the British people is a larger percentage of the gross national product than ever before. In addition, that burden has fallen on the very poorest people. Comparisons with 1979 show that the bottom percentile of families have lost an average of £8.50 per week, while the top 10 per cent. have gained £40 per week. what cuts there have been in direct taxation have been paid for entirely by cuts in the value of benefit. Moreover, the less well off have borne the brunt of the shift from direct to indirect taxation.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Abbott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend reminds me that the list includes national insurance payments. People know that the total burden on the British public is heavier than ever before.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While we are debating tax bands, it is worth recalling some basic facts about income tax. It was introduced as a temporary measure, but it has been with us for quite some time. It exists on the premise that it is fair, that it is seen to be fair, and above all, that it is based on the ability to pay. Those principles have recently been underlined in connection with another tax. However, it is time for the Government — or, when they are relieved of duty, the next Labour Government — to reassess income tax and return it to its basic principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A major problem is the farcical absence of indexation of income tax. As a result, there is the annual pantomime over whether the Chancellor is or is not reducing income tax — whether he is giving money away or taking it back from people — when it is often merely a question of reintegrating income tax levels with inflation. It is about time we got rid of that farce and had an income tax system that increased automatically in line with inflation so that people knew where they were. Political decisions could then be taken which would really reduce or increase the income tax level according to the economic circumstances of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our present system of income tax has been further distorted by the reduction in the number of bands. When my hon. Friends on the Front Bench are in Government, one of their first duties will be to ensure a greater number of bands so that the tax system has a greater element of justice. Even in those circumstances there would be a number of poverty traps which would, by definition, affect most those at the bottom, where benefits and other items come into play. However, there is a way round that, and it is a way— surprisingly—that would lead to the next Labour Government being the Government that reduced the income tax burden on the average person and on virtually all people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This way would involve introducing a system that had a zero rate at the bottom with no personal allowances and went in percentage stages up to 60 per cent. I thank Conservative Members and the Inland Revenue for their correspondence on the matter—correspondence which is still flowing. The system would be completely fair and would be related almost exactly to one's ability to pay, with a given taxable income being clearly related to an exact and specific percentage tax rate. As a result, we would get rid of the barnacles that have encrusted what was a good principle of income tax. They are the barnacles of the various allowances—many of them historic, undeserved and unmerited—for which we all pay indirectly in higher taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
I hope that this Government—and, with greater optimism, the next Government—will look seriously at the concept of income tax and will return to one that is based far more on basic principles of fairness and the ability to pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) raised an issue contained in starred amendment No. 59. It deals with the situation of an elderly couple, one of whom may be below the age of 65 and the other above. Before independent taxation, such a couple would have received the married man's allowance appropriate to someone over 65, which is the married age allowance, whereas today the man would receive the married couple's allowance appropriate to someone over 65 but would get only the personal allowance appropriate to someone under 65. I shall attempt to show that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
Government's approach is logical even though, if it were not for transitional relief, as the hon. Member for Derby, South said, some people would be worse off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before 6 April 1990 the level of the married age allowance due to a husband depended on the age of the older of the husband and wife. Under independent taxation the same rule applies when determining the level of married couple's allowances due to the husband. It does not apply to the husband's personal allowance, the level of which depends only on his age. Section 257E provides that husbands who are married to older wives and who face a reduction in their allowances because of the introduction of independent taxation can claim a special personal allowance in place of their normal personal allowance. The special personal allowance is set at the level of the single age allowance due to a person of the wife's age in 1989–90. The special personal allowance is not increased from year to year. If the wife was aged between 65 and 74 in 1989–90, the allowance is £3,400. If she was aged 75 or over in 1989–90, it is £3,540. A special personal allowance is due for as long as it gives a husband more allowances than he would get under the normal independent taxation rules. Therefore the effect of the transitional arrangements in section 257E is to preserve the value of the husband's 1989–90 allowances in cash terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Starred amendment No. 59 would provide that, where it was more beneficial to him, a husband in these circumstances could claim allowances as if the pre-independent taxation rules still applied. The married couple's allowance and the personal allowance would be given at the level appropriate to his wife's age. The personal allowance related to the wife's age would not be frozen like the special personal allowance that is available under the present rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several other complicated consequences of starred amendment No. 59 which I shall not go into. The Government's approach is the most logical way in which to introduce independent taxation. When the husband is below one threshold and the wife is above it, independent taxation is logical although in the long run, were it not for the transitional relief there would be some losers. The hon. Member for Derby, South said that starred amendment No. 59 would preserve the favourable tax treatment given before the introduction of independent taxation to husbands married to older women. Independent taxation changes the position by giving the husband only the personal allowance appropriate to his age, although the amount of the married couples' allowance is related to the age of the older of the couple. That is the most sensible and fair way of applying an independent taxation system. The hon. Lady's amendment would preserve an anomalous position. It would not provide complete symmetry between husband and wife and might be branded by some as a little sexist. Transitional relief ensures that there will be no losers, and it maintains the logic of independent taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the Chief Secretary's point, but want him to clarify one matter. Although he says that there will be no losers among those who currently draw the allowances — I accept that entirely — those who would have begun to draw them in this or subsequent years will not get the same level of allowances as those who have drawn them in the past and who will be protected under the transitional relief arrangements. So, while there will be no
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
losers among existing taxpayers, under the new system a lower level of relief will be available for people in those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the other allowances are increasing at the same time. There will be no cash losers and few losers in real terms. The hon. Lady does not have a good point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After she referred to the starred amendment, the hon. Lady mentioned the basic rate band. That was surprising. I am not aware that we concealed the fact that we did not increase the basic rate band. Usually the Opposition criticise us for what we have done over the years. We have done much for higher-rate taxpayers and rightly so, but this is the first time that we have been criticised for not increasing the threshold at which people pay higher-rate tax. That decision was made in the light of Budget arithmetic and of changes in the tax system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps they have crossed the threshold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is on to a serious point. It may have been right or wrong not to have increased the higher-rate threshold this year, but it is a poor way to illustrate the point by saying that we must consider how that affects Members of Parliament. The issue should be judged on its merits, not on how it affects Members of Parliament. Under the Labour administration, the higher-rate threshold seemed mysteriously to begin at just about the level of the salaries of Members of Parliament. As interested as we all are in the salaries of Members of Parliament, that is not a good way of deciding taxation priorities. We decided this year not to increase the basic rate band, even though we have increased it considerably, well ahead of the rate of inflation, during our time in office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott) and for Nottingham North (Mr. Allen) raised familiar points about taxation, alleging that the Government have not cut taxes. Income tax as a proportion of gross domestic product is lower than when we came to office. As my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) said, almost every time that we have cut income tax, it has been done in the teeth of opposition from the Labour party. If we had accepted the rates, the allowances and the thresholds that we inherited in 1979 and merely adjusted them for inflation, every single point of income distribution, every decile, would be paying far more tax than they are paying today. That is a fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As part of that bargain of putting back the rates to what they were in 1979, would the Chief Secretary also put back the rates on national insurance, VAT and indirect taxes and then tell us what the calculation is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My remarks apply, including national insurance. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to add indirect taxes too the key point is the one made by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea about what has happened to take-home pay. Take-home pay is real pay measured after price increases including indirect taxation. For a person on average earnings, real take-home pay has increased by about 34 per cent. and for a person on half average earnings it has gone up some 26 per cent. compared with a miserly 4 per cent. when the Labour party was in Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: People on above average pay have benefited from the reductions in taxation that we have made and we do not conceal this. The important point is that the contribution to income tax revenues the top 5 per cent. and the top 10 per cent. has been markedly increased by the Government. We have cut rates and generated more revenue. That is the lesson the Labour party refuses to learn. Despite the claims of Labour Members today, the Labour party is the party of high taxation and high spending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->

However, there are those, including some of my hon. Friends, who feel that the Government have brought forward this proposal in a desperate bid to do something that is acceptable and seen to be decent—many would say that it is long overdue—to liven up a Budget that is otherwise pretty dead and dull.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Budget serves as anything at all, it is as a condemnation of everything that was done in 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The motive behind the clause is explained in the Red Book, where the cost of the measure is described as negligible. The key to the provision lies there, and not in the statements that trumpeted the measure as an act of compassion—by a Government who do not believe in compassion, or not if it involves public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 17 doubles the standard blind person's allowance from £540 to £1,080, but there is a small anomaly that I should like the Government in a bipartisan spirit, to consider. If we can get no response today, will the Chief Secretary return to the House on Report with an amendment that would meet the anomaly?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tried to devise a suitable amendment, and failed to do so for reasons that I shall understand when I am on the Government side of the Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that he cannot wait— he is right, none of us can, but we will have to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The anomaly is that, under the new system of independent taxation, when the husband and wife are both blind each will be able to claim the now disabled allowance of £1,080. The allowance, however, is not transferable. When both husband and wife are blind it is unlikely that both will be in employment. As the allowance is not transferable, if one is employed and the other stays at home, whereas under the old rules they would have been allowed two standard blind person's allowances, as I understand the new rules they will now be allowed only one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, no one will lose out financially, as the allowance being doubled compensates for the fact that there will be one allowance instead of two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We tried to amend the Bill, but we could not devise an amendment that would have succeeded. But I am certain that the Committee would not want to disadvantage a couple, both of whom were blind but only one of whom was working, and would like an assurance from the Government that an amendment will be forthcoming. I repeat that although no one will be disadvantaged, the bonus of a doubling of the allowance would not be obtainable in those circumstances. We would welcome a statement by the Chief Secretary that it would be obtainable, but I suspect that it is not, so I seek an assurance that that anomaly will be addressed on Report. The overall cost of the Government's proposals is said to be negligible. In the Red Book, the cost of the reform would be a negligible portion of a negligible sum. I hope that the Chief Secretary will see to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise not to carp about what the Opposition have called a negligible amount for those who are suffering—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not me calling it a negligible amount. The Government say so in their "Financial Statement". The word "negligible" is the Government's, not mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Red Book states that it will cost the Exchequer £2 million; but the fiscal effect will be negligible. The hon. Gentleman emphasised the word; I, too, would like to emphasise it on behalf of the blind and partially sighted. The allowance is of major importance for the sightless, and the increase is most welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Opposition that the blind person's allowance remained almost unchanged throughout the last Labour Administration. Only when my right hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. MacGregor) was Chief Secretary to the Treasury did we see an increase — the first for many years — followed by a major increase made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Thames (Mr. Lamont) from £540 to £1,080. That is not something to carp about: it should be welcomed. Blind people have many extra expenses. They cannot enjoy spending their income as others can. The increase is the least we can do for that sector of society. I welcome it without making snide comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome my right hon. Friend the Chancellor's statement on the separate taxation of women that it matters not which of the two — the husband or wife — is blind — an allowance will be available. However, I, too, request clarification on how the allowances are to be transferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the increase to £1,080 is not only generous; the Government should be congratulated on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too welcome the doubling of tax relief for blind people. But I also wish to associate myself— without the need to elaborate — with what was said by the hon. Member for Newcastle, East (Mr. Brown). I understand from the briefing by the Royal National Institute for the Blind and from the commentary on the Budget statement following the Budget that it would be paid when one partner — the husband — was blind. The effect would be neutral in terms of the transitional protection, but the benefit that goes to some blind taxpayers would not be enjoyed by that small number of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
The briefing shows that in 1988 there were 153,000 registered blind people in the United Kingdom, yet the estimate of the RNIB is that only a third of those will have incomes that are high enough to make use of the special allowance. While we welcome the measure, it is important not to forget the 100,000 registered blind people who will not receive benefit. That underlines the need to integrate the tax and benefit systems. As the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) said, blind people have expenses because of their blindness. Those are borne regardless of whether they have a taxable income. The measure is helpful and welcome — but we should not kid ourselves, because there are many blind people who will gain nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must have a sense of proportion as to what the Government's proposal will do. It is not the first time that we have been presented with a change in the Budget that the Government suggest will affect a vast number of people. I recall the workplace nurseries that were sold as a great policy change that would affect millions, but in practice, the effects were extremely slight. It is important to bear in mind that this change will benefit only a small proportion of people who have a visual handicap. It is important, too, to remember that the vast majority of blind people are dependent on state benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 1 April this year, income support for a registered blind person under pensionable age was only £52.10 a week. In Treasury terms, that amounts to £2,709.20 a year. Income support is not taxable, so tax relief cannot help anyone who is dependent on benefit. Some of us have been members of Committees on social security bills and we waited three years for reports from the Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys about benefits for people with disabilities. The reports were published last year, but we are still awaiting the measures that will translate those proposals into practical action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) suggests that we may see the halcyon days of an integration of the tax and benefits systems. The Govenment have a duty to think about the various measures implemented by the Treasury and proposed in the Finance Bill, and those introduced by social security legislation, as one measure could undercut another. The way to help most people with a visual handicap would be to improve disability benefits. That would ensure that the extra costs incurred by blind and partially-sighted people would be met. The proposal will benefit only a few. We should consider those who will not be eligible for the benefit, but who live in difficult circumstances because of decisions taken elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not enough for the Government to sell the measure as a major improvement for blind people and those with a visual handicap when benefit is taken away with the other hand by decisions made elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to the hon. Member for Newcastle, East (Mr. Brown), the blind person's allowance will be transferrable in exactly the same terms as the married couple's allowance. It can be transferred if the recipient has insufficient income to use it all. That provision is in paragraph 8 of Schedule 3 of the Finance Act 1988. It does not matter which partner is blind, as the unused blind person's allowance can be transferred either from the wife to the husband or vice versa.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'> Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The anomaly arises only when both husband and wife are blind and when, under independent taxation, each receives the now double allowance. If only one works, the person who does not would not be able to transfer his or her allowance. The anomaly would occur when one, admittedly doubled, allowance could be made use of instead of both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'> Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will examine he hon. Gentleman's remarks. My understanding is that the allowance can be transferred on the same terms as the married couple's allowance but with the proviso that the whole of the allowance has not been used. I shall let the hon. Gentleman know if there is any further information that he should have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne East, gave a slightly mean, reticent welcome to the measure. It has never been great and dramatic; it has always been considered a sensible and considerable change in the allowance, as my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr Hanley) said. Opposition Members may not consider it a great change but the doubling of an allowance from £540 to £1,080 is a considerable increase. The allowance will be worth more than £5 a week to a basic rate taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By contrast, if we had merely indexed the allowance to its figure when the Labour party was in Government, it would be worth only £450 today. The Government have gone much further. Then the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne East, tabled an amendment proposing that the allowance be doubled. The Opposition are always good at doing such things when they are comfortably in Opposition but not so good when they are in Government. This applies equally to the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Wallace) whose party, we can safely predict, will never be in Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm that only one-third of registered blind people—the only people who may apply—have incomes that are high enough for this increased allowance to be of benefit? Were not the figures put to him before the measure was drafted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. The hon. Members for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) and for Orkney and Shetland both raised that point. I understand that there are 145,000 registered blind people of whom only 40,000 are taxpayers. It is true that as this is, by definition, a tax allowance, it will not help non-taxpayers. Nevertheless, it seems sensible to give a little help to the slightly, but not greatly, better-off blind taxpayers, which is what we did. The hon. Gentleman is correct to say that other blind people would have to be helped in other ways. The 40,000 blind taxpayers will welcome the increased allowance which will be worth about £2.60 a week, in addition to the main tax changes proposed in the Budget. It is a modest measure, but one that the Committee should welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'> Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We unambiguously welcome the doubling of the relief. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr Battle) was right to set it in its wider context and point to the number of people who will be advantaged and to the many who will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Chief Secretary to the Treasury for his assurance that if it transpires that both parties to a marriage are blind, and one is employed and the other is not, and the allowances of both cannot be fully utilised because of their arrangements, in principle the
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
Government will be willing to come back on Report and adjust the proposal. That way, such people would benefit from the Government's generosity in doubling the allowance and not have just one allowance which, although doubled, would set them back to the starting point: they would gain nothing. I take it from what the Chief Secretary said that that was not the Government's intention. I understand that he will make an adjustment on Report if the allowance is not wholly usable, and I thank the right hon. Gentleman for that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now move to corporation tax, and the import of clause 18 is that the standard rate should remain the same for this financial year as it was for the last.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a moment, I shall ask the Government to explain why they ruled out a number of possible changes to the corporation tax system, but first, it is worth pointing out that the tax brings in about £19 billion in income to the Exchequer. I was intrigued by two answers to recent parliamentary questions, because they throw up an interesting subsequent question, and I shall be grateful if the Chief Secretary will enlighten me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 1 March this year, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), the Financial Secretary gave the percentage of gross domestic product, and that of company incomes, represented by the corporation tax take in each year from 1979 to 1989. The percentage of company incomes is the interesting one. In 1979, the percentage represented by corporation tax was 11.7; in 1989, the percentage represented by corporation tax was 18.4. That is a substantial increase and it has occurred especially since the major changes to the corporation tax system in 1984–85, as the figures make clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, some two weeks later, there was an interesting reply to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr Allen) on 15 March—no doubt my hon. Friend will wish to take up the point himself—in which he asked what percentage of company income went in taxes in general between 1979 and 1989. In 1979, it was 38.9 per cent., and in 1989, it was 38.7 per cent. In other words, the percentage of company income as a whole that goes in taxes is much the same now as it was 10 years ago, yet the take from corporation tax as a percentage of company income has risen from 11.7 per cent. to 18.4 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question that arises from the two somewhat contradictory responses is why a substantial amount of taxation other than corporation tax appears to have disappeared from the system. The take from company income as a whole has remained the same but the take from corporation tax as a proportion of income has risen dramatically. Can the Government tell us the reason for that phenomenon?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that with small company relief it is possible for a company to achieve profits of £1 million before it pays the full rate of corporation tax? Our corporation tax regime is one of the most benign in the EC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman anticipates our discussion of clause 19, which relates specifically to the small companies rate. The hon. Gentleman's question is not relevant to the apparent disparity in parliamentary answers to which I drew attention. The overall percentage of company income taken by corporation tax at the small companies' rate is already included in the calculation in the answer given on 1 March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to clause 18, why did not the Government take advantage of the Budget to listen more carefully to representations from the CBI and others for improved first year depreciation allowances against corporation tax for investment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition do not support a blanket improvement across the board for any and all kinds of investment, but we wish the Government had taken more account of the desperate need of manufacturing industry for greater investment, especially when high interest rates make it difficult for industry to borrow to invest. A change in the tax system to make it more attractive for industry to undertake virtuous investment out of existing profits would have been a boost to investment that could have reaped considerable rewards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Government's attention to the CBI's Budget submission, "Investing for the New Decade". Although it advocated a lower corporation tax rate in the long run, the CBI's immediate priority was a change in the system of depreciation allowances so that companies could write off plant and machinery investment against tax more rapidly. It wanted a 40 per cent. rather than a 25 per cent. first year rate. It advanced as a reason for the change that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it would target the reduction in business taxation precisely where it is needed—towards investment. Faster depreciation would improve the incentive to invest and those companies with the highest levels of capital expenditure would benefit to the greatest extent."</p></blockquote>
The Opposition's Budget proposals, which were available to the press and the public before the Budget, advocated precisely such a change. However, we argued that it should be targeted at investment in plant and machinery for manufacturing industry and for scientific research and development purposes, because giving a blanket allowance above the present depreciation allowance might well lead to abuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will this harm or improve the balance of trade position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks me the easiest question I have been asked all day. It will improve the balance of payments position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is probably labouring under the misapprehension that his right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary tended to encourage about a year ago—although we have heard less of it recently. The argument was that a large portion of our balance of trade deficit was represented by the importation of machinery and plant being used for investment. Last year the Government argued that our balance of payments deficit was large because investment was at such a high rate. How the Government could say
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
that a year ago and argue the same way now, when investment is stagnant and the Chancellor is predicting that manufacturing investment will show a negative figure during the next year, is beyond me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why the opposite is the case is that investment, especially that in the tradeable part of our economy which is largely manufacturing industry, is the key to our being able to produce goods that people want to buy and to export goods that people abroad will want to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes does not understand that the key to future wealth creation must lie in improved investment performance, I am afraid that he must start some basic economic lessons. The CBI appreciates that point, as do the TUC, the Engineering Employers Federation, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the Mechanical and Metal Trades Confederation, all of which argue for improvements in initial depreciation allowances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to complete his picture, will the hon. Gentleman also accept that the Liberal Democrats put forward a similar proposal in their budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that confirmation from the Liberal Democrats, who for once appear to be doing things right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, there is a wide consensus in industry and among Labour Members that the Government should have used the Budget to do something about our relatively poor investment performance. They did not. The major question we should ask the Government is why they decided not to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures by London Economics in its study published in Janury 1990, entitled "Corporation Tax and Investment in UK Manufacturing", estimated the percentage increase in investment per £1 billion of tax forgone by the Government under a number of different reforms to the corporation tax system. One point that emerged from the study was that the long-term effect is much more beneficial than the short-term effect because of the time lag involved in corporation tax assessment. The long-term effect of increasing capital allowances is a 3.2 per cent. increase in investment for each £1 billion of revenue foregone. That is a fairly substantial investment impact as a result of a fiscal change. It strikes us as odd that the Government did not listen more carefully to the arguments advanced by the CBI and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as wondering why the Government did not use the corporation tax system to improve investment performance, we have another crucial question: why did they not examine the environmental impact of the corporation tax system? Among the changes that we urged the Government to consider in advance of the Budget was precisely how the computation of corporation tax is related to environmentally sensitive items of expenditure incurred by companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall cite two obvious examples. First, let us suppose that a company undertakes energy-efficient investment to reduce its energy requirements and, thereby, contributes to the avoidance of global warming. Is it not sensible to encourage companies to do that, perhaps by providing a greater allowance against corporation tax liability for expenditure incurred by such action?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, let us compare the former company with a firm which can write off the expenditure incurred by purchasing chlorofluorocarbons against its corporation tax liability
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
because it is a legitimate business expense. Why do not the Government consider reforming the corporation tax system to ensure that expenditure on CFCs, for example, is not allowable against corporation tax liability? The corporation tax system could be used to encourage companies to be environmentally sensitive and to discourage them from being environmentally destructive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

Such a system would considerably increase the costs of various end products.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is incorrect; alternatives to refrigerators do exist. The whole purpose of such a change would be to shift the behaviour of companies in an environmental sensitive direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Opposition are arguing that the fiscal system should be used to encourage the search for alternatives and to penalise the continued use of ozone-depleting substances. Conservative Members want precisely the opposite; to continue a tax system that would do nothing to encourage changes in behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ask the Government two major questions. First, why did they rule out all the representations from industry about increasing first year depreciation allowances to give the boost to investment we need so desperately in our manufacturing industry? Secondly, why did they not begin to move the use of the corporation tax system in an environmetally friendly direction? They had two major opportunities, but I am afraid that they missed both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should like to investigate the answers, which I do not have in front of me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trend of corporation tax as a percentage of companies' incomes reflects two aspects: first, the 1984 reforms reducing first year allowances; and secondly, the considerable increase in United Kingdom companies' profitability, to which I shall refer in a moment. The figures that the hon. Gentleman quoted in relation to other taxes on companies probably reflected the abolition of the national insurance surcharge, which would have had a considerable impact on the figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the Chief Secretary, but I am not clear about how the shortfall was made up by means of other taxation. From the two parliamentary questions to which my hon. Friend alluded, it appears that half the income in taxation receipts must have come from sources other than those that existed in 1979. Can the Chief Secretary tell us, off the top of his head, about those sources? If he cannot, I shall table some questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the answer off the top of my head. I am not sure that I entirely followed the hon. Gentleman, but the main phenomenon has been the remarkable increase in corporation tax receipts which, as a proportion of GDP, have increased considerably. But that reflects the dramatically improved profitability of British industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury asked a question about the environment and another about why we made no changes in the regime. As he knows, we intend in the autumn to publish a White Paper on the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any role that we see for further fiscal measures over and above those we have already taken on such matters as the progressive shift from vehicle excise duty to petrol duties and the differential between leaded and unleaded petrol, would be discussed there. Obviously, I must not anticipate the White Paper, but if we wished to use the corporation system in the way the hon. Gentleman suggested, that is the sort of option that it would canvass. However, I hope that he will understand why I do not feel able to anticipate the document's content this afternoon.

The more substantial question from the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury was why we made no changes in the corporation tax system in the Budget. Our reason is that we are well satisfied with the structure of that system, which underwent massive reform in 1984. It has been a beneficial structural change, whereby we lessened the capital allowances available to industry but dramatically lowered the rate. Our corporation tax rate is one of the lowest amongst advanced industrialised countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the main reasons for a change in this area of taxation is the increasingly important role that small businesses are playing in our economy. They face real difficulties when borrowing money to invest. A change would help with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the comments of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury were about mainstream corporation tax regime, not about small companies. The next clause will deal with them. We have made a beneficial change over and above all the other changes that we have made over the years to assist the small company sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, changes made in the corporation tax regime in 1984 have proved beneficial. Many fears were expressed by Opposition Members at the time; but far from investment being adversely affected by the lessening of allowances, it has gone from strength to strength. It boomed and boomed. We have no reason to believe that simplification and the move towards a cleaner system in 1984 has done anthing but give a strong incentive to profitable investment. We want the sort of investment that is profitable and yields a good return, rather than subsidising investment through the tax system. We have had a high level of investment in recent years and a correspondingly
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
high level of profitability. That is why we have not altered the system, having made such major reforms in 1984. The system that we established then has been seen to work, and to work well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman will have worked on the detail of the Budget, and perhaps on this very clause, in the certain knowledge that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and his Department were predicting a fall of 1 per cent. in business investment for 1990. Does he not accept, as a point of political philosophy, that to change the rate of corporation tax and to make parts of the tax more flexible could be a stimulus to investment. Does he accept that the reason why he has not done that is because he was constrained by other factors in the economy, not because changing the corporation tax was not a stimulus to investment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's intervention leads me to exactly the point that I wanted to make. It would not be wise to alter the structure of rate of corporation tax or to introduce a new system of allowances in response to the modest fall in investment that we are predicting for this year. We predict only a 1 per cent. fall in investment. Business investment has increased by more than 40 per cent. in the past three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People are complaining because of some flattening out, but we want the economy to cool down. Cooling down affects investment. After a 40 per cent. increase, the suggestion that we should alter the taxation system because of such modest flattening out seems to be too much like the short-term demand management which we have abandoned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Investment has increased twice as fast as consumption; business investment as a proportion of GDP compares favourably with that of our competitors; we have had an investment boom. I stand by what I said to the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury — that part of our current account deficit reflects the excess of investment over domestic savings. That is why we import savings from abroad. In recent years investment has been almost too strong. There is no good case for altering the basic structure of the corporation tax system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A moment ago, the right hon. Gentleman made a remarkable statement. He said that the Government wanted the economy to cool down and that investment formed part of that process. He came dangerously close to welcoming the tailing off of investment. That analysis fails to comprehend the difference between cooling down demand and ensuring that supply through investment thrives in order to meet demand in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course the Government want long-term investment in the supply side of the economy. My statement was not remarkable, but self-evident. Some flattening out of the recent considerable increase in investment is far from surprising when the economy slows down. That does not justify short-term tinkering with a corporation tax system that has served well and stimulated profitable investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Chief Secretary for giving way. I too was surprised by his statement. The Chief Secretary claimed that the tailing off of investment was not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
surprising. He also clearly suggested that it was desirable. Is the 1 per cent. fall that he mentioned sufficient to meet Government requirements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have explained that issue fully. There has been 40 per cent. business growth over the past three years. That is a remarkable achievement. Investment growth on that scale will not happen during the next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury suggested that the Government should have increased capital allowances in line with some of the representations made. Those allowances were changed under a new system in 1984 and are broadly in line with commercial depreciation. To reintroduce accelerated depreciation would distort investment decisions and run counter to the thrust of the 1984 reforms. The 25 per cent. capital allowance on a reducing balance basis for plant and machinery is a generous average rate of depreciation compared with normal commercial rates. The special regime for short-life assets, which can be written off more quickly for tax, must also be taken into account. It is more beneficial than the normal arrangement for commercial depreciation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested that there should be indexed capital allowances for inflation. My point about the tax rate of depreciation and the normal rates at which assets are depreciated applies again. Investment should not be indexed and protected against inflation. The answer is to get on top of inflation. There has been a considerable rise in business investment, but there is no reason to believe that the present structure, which derives from the 1984 reforms, is incompatible with strong investment. A change in the tax system in response to short-term conditions is not justifiable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 19 establishes the rate of corporation tax for small companies. It keeps the rate the same, at 25 per cent., but amends the limits of the small companies' rate by raising the lower threshold from £150,000 to £200,000 and the upper limit from £750,000 to £1 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East (Mr. Brown), perspicacious as ever, anticipated the Government's decision. In two parliamentary questions, which were answered on 23 February 1990, he asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer, first, what would be the cost in a full year of raising the lower limit for the reduced rate of corporation tax from £150,000 to £200,000. That is precisely what the Government did a month later. Secondly, he asked how many companies would be affected. He was told that the change would cost £30 million and that 20,000 companies would be affected. The Opposition welcome the change because it will benefit some small businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
I have one detailed question and a general observation. The detailed question relates to a minor abuse by large companies that use the small companies' rate by spreading profits and losses among a group of related companies. It is widespread practice among medium-sized and some large companies to arrange the profit profile of different companies within their group to take advantage of the small companies' rate. The total value of such manipulation is not large in any given group. At present, a maximum of £150,000 is involved which, when taxed at 25 per cent. rather than 35 per cent., would give a maximum benefit of £15,000 a year. That would rise to a potential £20,000 a year with the changes in clause 19.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That sum is not large, but if 2,000 groups of companies were to use the device in a financial year, it would cause a tax leakage of £20 million that year. The sum is not astronomical, but it is a handy-sized piece of Exchequer revenue that could be foregone because of companies manipulating their profit returns to ensure that parts of their operation were taxed at the small companies' rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For smallish groups of companies, the necessary arrangements are generally straightforward. For groups with many active member companies, the extra work involved tends to counteract the savings achieved, but only the very largest groups fall into that category. Therefore this device is cost-effective for small and medium-sized groups of companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The availability of relief depends on the fact that it is applied company by company, not groupwide. Group relief allows profits to be effectively arranged within limits round a group. Most groups have a holding company on top which makes losses for tax purposes via interest and management expenses payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing legislation, broadly, allows a company to claim the small companies' rate if its profits are less than the lower limit—currently £150,000—divided by the number of active United Kingdom and foreign companies in its tax group. It prevents "profit splitting" to put £150,000 of profit into each subsidiary and letting each claim relief. It is not possible, under the current system, for each constituent company to claim the full £150,000. However, the system does not prevent the group as a whole claiming £150,000 in total, divided at the small companies' rate between the various constituent groups. That is a loophole and the Government are doing nothing in the Finance Bill to close it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amount involved is relatively small; the maximum extra relief which can be claimed by any group of companies is £15,000 and under the new rates it will be £20,000. None the less, if used on a widespread scale over the country as a whole, it could represent a substantial sum. It would be useful if the Government would consider the problem and come back with proposals to tackle it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Welcome as the changes in clause 19 may be for small companies, they are as nothing compared with the burden on small businesses of the Government's high interest rate policy. In April, a Confederation of British Industry survey stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the cost of finance is an increasingly important constraint on planned investment … for 23 per cent. of firms, the highest proportion since July 1980".</p></blockquote>
From the work done by the CBI and the Forum of Private Business, from the reports of bad debt difficulties faced by firms borrowing from major High street banks and from talking to business managers throughout the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
country, it is clear that high interest rates are a deterrent to investment. Companies in the small business sector refer to high interest rates as a factor which deters them from expansion and investment plans. While the changes to corporation tax will doubtless be welcomed by those business managers, they would achieve much more in terms of relief and planning for the future if the Government ceased their exclusive reliance on interest rates as their only mechanism to cool down the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth reminding the Committee that in his latest forecasts, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has admitted that there will be negative investment growth of minus 1.25 per cent. in manufacturing industry in the coming year. That can give no one pleasure. The changes proposed in the Budget will do little to improve investment performance. If one adds to that the impact of the uniform business rate in many areas—it is a substantially redistributive mechanism, but none the less in substantial parts of the country it imposes a substantial extra burden on business—the Governments failure to boost our performance both on training and producing skilled manpower for business and industry and the general economic circumstances that small businesses face, we realise that tinkering with the upper an lower limits of the small business rate of corporation tax is small beer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I would not urge my hon. Friends to oppose the clause, the change that it represents, welcome as it may be to small businesses, deals with only one of many large problems for small businesses that the Government should be, but are not, tackling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Watts 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Slough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, wish to refer to the application of the small companies' rate of corporation tax to groups of companies, but whereas the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) described it as a loophole, I would describe it as an anomaly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's argument was that if a company made a profit of £200,000, he welcomed the fact that under the provisions of the clause it would be taxed at 25 per cent., which is the small companies' rate. However, he seemed to think that there was something wrong in a group of companies having the benefit of the same lower rate of corporation tax, even if its profits were no greater than those of an individual small company. I cannot see the logic of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Gentlemen on the Opposition Front Bench were to form themselves into a company that made a profit of £200,000, it would be reasonable that they should be taxed at only 25 per cent. If those same four gentlemen formed themselves into a group of four companies that, between them, made a profit of £200,000, surely they should also benefit as a group from the lower rate of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the rules operate at present, the relief within a small group of companies is apportioned equally between those companies and does not necessarily reflect the profits of each company, unless, by extremely expert financial planning, each company happens to earn in profits its exact proportion of the group's profits. That means that some companies in the group will be unable to use the full amount of relief apportioned to them while others, whose profits are above the apportioned share of the small companies' rate, will pay tax at a higher rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
Because the apportionment of relief applies also to companies in a group that are not resident in this country, although overseas companies are not allowed to benefit from the small companies' relief, there is a further siphoning off of the intended benefit from the small group of companies to the single entity small company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument with care, but do not understand why he says that member companies of a group should be treated in the same way as unrelated companies of an equivalent size. In the first instance, the strength of the group will protect and endorse each member company, but in the second, it will not. I fail to understand the logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Watts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is falling into the trap of believing that a group of companies must, automatically, be large. A group can be made up of companies that, individually, are very small indeed. A company may, for good operational reasons, choose to operate through a number of separate companies rather than as one entity. I could cite as an example a leading biotechnology company in my constituency, whose management style is to spin off a newly developed product for further development by a separate, subsidiary company. That gives more of the scientists and managers involved in the process a chance of more direct involvement in the company's success. It is also the best method of identifying the company's profit centre. However, the practice does not make the group any bigger or stronger than it would have been as a single entity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The operation of the law regarding non-resident companies may prove to be a significant disadvantage to small groups seeking to establish foreign subsidiaries in other European Community member states to take advantage of the single market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my right hon. Friend will not accede to Opposition requests to block a loophole, because no loophole exists. I hope that he will undertake to re-examine the rules governing the apportionment of the rate of corporation tax applicable to small companies and the marginal relief between the companies in a group. That will help bring about the desirable goal of making the chosen structure within which a business operates — whether as a single entity or as a group of small companies — irrelevant to the amount of corporation tax that is paid. A group of companies that earns £200,000 in profit should pay no more tax than would be levied against a single entity earning the same amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was grateful for at least the first remarks of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) when he welcomed the provisions in the Bill. They are, of course, considerable. They will be of important help to small companies and, as the figures show, to medium-sized companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of what constitutes a small company has been considerably expanded over the years. That is to be welcomed, but it is in addition to much other work by the Government to help small companies and to cut rates of tax. Since 1979, we have reduced the small companies' rate by no less than 17 percentage points, from 42 per cent. to the present rate of 25 per cent., which is in line with the basic rate of income tax. Last year, we increased the profits
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
limit by some 50 per cent. and this year we have substantially increased the profits limit yet again. In two years the profits limit has been doubled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury knew from his anticipatory written questions, some 3,000 more companies will pay tax at the small companies' rate than do now. However, more than 20,000 companies will pay less tax as a result of the increase this year. That is a considerable number of companies to benefit from the change and I know that it has been widely welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting that two opposing views were put—one by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury and one by my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Mr. Watts). I was expecting more representations of the sort made by my hon. Friend than those along the lines described by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury—for good reason. There are companies that are concerned about the impact of the anti-fragmentation rules and the allocation of relief on a strictly numerical basis. My learned Friend made that point and I am sure that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury is aware of how the anti-fragmentation rules apply. They are effective in preventing any significant abuse of the small companies' rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be some scope for artificial devices—the law cannot always be framed in such a way as to prevent manipulation in all circumstances—but the amount of money involved would not be large, as I think the hon. Gentleman conceded. Only groups with taxable profits of under £1 million within the whole group will be able to do what the hon. Gentleman described, but that must be balanced against the points made by my hon. Friend and Member for Slough. Relief must be available in the same way to groups of companies when the companies within those groups are themselves small companies. As my hon. Friend pointed out, there can be strong commercial reasons, apart from tax—in any case the group relief is divided up numerically within the £1 million—why different businesses within a group may be split up in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the point made by my hon. Friend about foreign subsidiaries and I undertake to look at that, although without commitment and not before Rpt. I hope that my hon. Friend will be content to leave the matter with me. My sympathies are more with my hon. Friend than with the hon. Gentleman, although I shall read Hansard to see whether I have missed anything in the learned Gentleman's remarks. I believe that he is not giving full weight to the anti-fragmentation rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The large increase in the small companies' rate limits over two years is a dramatic measure. It goes some way to lessen the impact of high interest rates on the small companies sector. High interest rates hit business start-ups and small companies in particular, and our party is aware of that. It is a measure of the changed climate for enterprise and small businesses that despite base rates of 15 per cent., net registrations of new businesses in 1989 increased by 25 per cent. over the previous year. They have been running at 1,500 a week. In the first four months of 1990 there has been a continued strong net increase in the number of new businesses. That is a dramatic change from the situation a decade ago. When we came to office, we inherited a world in which there were more business failures than start-ups. It is remarkable that at a time when we have base rates at 15 per cent., we still have people wanting to chance their arm
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
and start up new businesses because they know that the long-term climate for small businesses in this country is good and healthy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that that is happening despite interest rates being at 15 per cent.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I readily conceded that high interest rates do not make life easy for the small business community, but it is more important to contain inflation and slow down the economy.

The Chief Secretary mentioned the growth in small businesses, but he did not mention the bankruptcies that have increased as a result of the economic climate.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
High interest rates are seriously damaging industry, especially small businesses. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) mentioned the uniform business rate, which has not had the effect that the Government said that it would have. It is increasingly becoming a burden on small businesses. I wish to mention the skills shortage and the lack of investment in research and development that has seriously damaged industry. Although the Government brag that investment in research and development is high, the United Kingdom has experienced a serious technological decline. The Government compile statistics in such a way that the true facts about research and development are not known. We are way behind our major competitors in research and development spending as a percentage of value added in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
manufacturing. That is a good indicator of how much industry values long-term investment. The Government could have taken advantage of the Finance Bill to do something about that serious problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is massive evidence about the skills shortages. All sectors of industry are worried about the problems that will arise in the future when we become a low-tech country, trailing behind our competitors. Even the Government's friends, The Sunday Times, in an excellent article entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"Poor education puts Britain on the skids"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The current education and training systems cannot even maintain the UK's status as second-rate economic power."</p></blockquote>
Although I welcome this small concession, the Government have missed an opportunity to do something about the areas that I have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
