	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong) </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 46), Private Finance Initiative (HC 408).</p></blockquote>
As hon. Members will know, the Government are committed to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public services across the country, and recognise the importance of capital expenditure in meeting that objective. We are determined to ensure that local authorities manage their capital effectively and prudently, and we see public-private partnerships in central and local government as a key way of achieving that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have been able to use the private finance initiative since 1996, when changes were made to the regulations controlling authorities' capital financing arrangements. They had previously stood in the way of PFI deals. In opposition, we recognised that public-private partnerships had great potential and we supported the theory. When we came to power we set about removing the practical obstacles to such partnerships generally and to PFI in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go over all the changes that we have made, although we have significantly increased the level of investment that can be supported. We have also been involved with the project review group, which meets several times a year to endorse projects that have requested Government money. Those projects cannot enter procurement until they have been endorsed. The PRG is an inter-departmental body chaired by a task force at the Treasury, and includes representatives from local governement and the organisation set up by local government: the four Ps—the public-private partnership programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than £3 billion-worth of PFI credits have been made available for 1997 to 2002, of which nearly £1.8 billion-worth have been allocated. These are significant sums. Central Government support is leading to high-quality schemes, which in turn produce much-needed new investment in local areas and help to make PFI a familiar way in which local authorities may improve services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sixth group of local government PFI projects has just been endorsed, bringing the number of schemes approved so far to nearly 100. The schemes differ widely among all types of authority in all parts of the country. They show both the adaptability of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
PFI approach and the energy with which local authorities are seizing the opportunity that PFIs present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the reasons for special grants? As hon. Members will know, local authorities obtain most of their financial support from central Government in the form of a block grant called the revenue support grant. As it is such a large amount of money—nearly £20 billion in the current financial year—decisions on what the grant is to include or exclude in any year must be taken some six months before the start of that year. That is too early to allow us to forecast accurately which local authorities would be likely to sign a PFI contract and start making payments under it during that year. We have therefore decided to pay the initial instalments of revenue support for PFI projects through special grant. That will allow us to take decisions much later in the cycle and to target support more accurately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The special grant report is technical and I shall not burden the Committee with the details, suffice it to say that it is a vital element in our approach to the local authority PFI. It sets out which authorities are eligible to receive special grant, what they get the grant for and how to calculate how much grant each authority will receive. No money can be paid out unless they Committee approves the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will be happy to answer hon. Members' questions, but I suspect that they would not want me to go into further detail. I commend the report to the Committee; it is part of the continuing good news for local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.36 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Ottaway 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for her explanation. In principle, we have no difficulty with the grants. I am grateful to her for explaining why they are separate from the revenue support grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) will say shortly, the measure does not state what the money is for. The Minister is right about the formula; it looks tremendously complicated. I want to press her on a more general point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's explanation moved comfortably between references to the PFI—private finance initiative—and public-private partnership, and back again. There is some anxiety about the difference between them. We know what PFI is because the previous Government developed the concept, but the public-private partnership is more vague. I hope that the Minister will explain its meaning so that the expression has more clarity and precision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.37 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Adrian Sanders 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torbay)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As this is probably the warmest day of the year, it is a pity that we cannot adjourn the Committee and carry on our proceedings on the Terrace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
We considered dividing the Committee on each of the grants, but noticed that
several Liberal Democrat authorities—Dorset, the Isle of Wight, Richmond-upon-Thames, North Wiltshire and Sheffield—were mentioned in the report. We agree with the Minister that taking the decision later in the cycle is a good move, but, as she said, the money cannot be paid unless it has the approval of the Committee. Therein lies our philosophical opposition to the way in which local government grants are dealt with: local councils are not free to meet community needs and to find ways of entering agreements locally with the private sector without the approval of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The private finance initiative is not the best way in which to ensure that local authorities can meet community needs or that resources go to local areas. It is an expensive way of borrowing money over a period of time. The amount of money that can be obtained for public projects in the long run will be less through the use of the PFI than under the old grant arrangements. Of course, it will be argued that PFI is more efficient because there is more scrutiny of individual bids, and there may be some merit in that argument. However, it is an extraordinarily expensive way of meeting public needs and people in the private sector profit from it. That is probably where money is wasted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.40 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that many of the newer Members are highly informed and educated and have great knowledge of the world of finance. I, unfortunately, am one of the older Members and do not have a clue about such things. It is a bit ridiculous to put a report such as this before a Committee because it tells us nothing. We are asked to approve it, but I genuinely do not know what I am meant to approve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the report includes a list of councils, some of which may well be run by the Liberal Democrats, although others are also agreeable. I need to be told what type of project the Government have in mind. We do not want all the details of each project but, as we are being asked to approve the document, it would help if I had an idea of their type and what is covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, perhaps the Minister would agree that it would be appropriate to give the Committee an idea of the sum that the Treasury is likely to pay in grant. The sum of £57.198 million is mentioned. Bearing in mind that this is a complicated matter, will the Minister say whether that figure is for Treasury expenditure, and if so, whether it will come from local government resources, which will mean less money being available to other authorities, such as mine, which the report does not mention?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, do the Government think that there might be merit in explaining issues in greater detail in legislative documents that they ask Committees to approve? Annex C, paragraph 2, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government made arrangements to provide revenue support for the capital element of the costs of a PFI transaction where the credit cover required was nil or was reduced, and at its discretion to give revenue support for other PFI transactions."</p></blockquote>
I appreciate that civil servants, like Members of Parliament, are becoming more knowledgeable by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
day about everything, but perhaps the Minister will explain what the sentence means and what it is intended to convey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to be difficult, but will the Minister make it clear whether the Government favour private finance initiatives and private-public partnerships without restriction? When I supported a Government to the best of my ability—I did not always support them—and the Labour party was in opposition and trying to help the Government, although it not always did so, this was not a subject that aroused great enthusiasm in the new Labour party. It seems to have had a change of face, so it would be helpful to know whether there is now full support for PFIs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing that silly Members like me who do not understand these matters would like to know is what would happen if the private part of a public-private partnership was a company that was unable to provide resources to complete a transaction. Who would have liability? How would the Government reclaim grants if they thought that they had been paid unfairly? Would such resources come from the revenue support grant or other sources?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is a genuine one. Before coming to the Committee, I read the document carefully, as no doubt all hon. Members did. None the less, I do not have a clue about what we are intended to approve, or what the document says. I should be grateful if the Minister would answer my questions, and in particular give me a full explanation of paragraph 2 of annexe C.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.43 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members asked about the difference between PFI and public-private partnership. The hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman), and the hon. Members for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) and for Taunton (Jackie Ballard), who represent the Liberal Democrats and were also present during debates on the Local Government Bill, along with other hon. Members, will know that the Government are interested in a range of relationships between the public and private sectors. They will also know that under best value—the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East was not present during debates on best value—essentially it is a local authority's responsibility to find the most effective and efficient way of delivering services. This may be achieved directly through the public sector; an external contractor may be involved; or it may be done through a public-private partnership—a joint venture company or a relationship of some sort. The Local Government Bill facilitates many ways of doing that. Some interesting pilots that are not straight PFI projects are already up and running. Straight PFI projects have clear rules and involve raising money for capital investment and the maintenance of that investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, public-private partnerships may not involve capital projects at all. For example, they may involve providing the service of collecting housing benefit and council tax benefit. Public-private
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
partnerships may involve a raft of local authority responsibilities and do not necessarily focus primarily on capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The PFI was established by the previous Government and has been developed by the present Government through the Bates review and Treasury-led work, in order that project risk is transferred to the private sector. The hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East may find it helpful if I tell him about local government projects that involve the PFI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The PFI contract for the building of the Speke forward learning centre in Liverpool will last for 25 to 30 years. The risks involved in the construction of that centre are being transferred to private sector contractors. Central Government responsibility for that project is divided between the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Department for Education and Employment. Both Departments are responsible for the PFI credits for the programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will have noticed that Kent county council—which is Conservative—is on the list. It will go into a PFI to acquire information technology. Again, the private sector will bear the risk of that investment for the period of the contract, which may be 20, 25 or 30 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Berwick-upon-Tweed, Derby, Manchester, North East Derbyshire and Tower Hamlets are all involved in housing proposals. The work done on PFI in social housing demonstrates that it is most suitable for refurbishment, such as replacing windows, bathrooms, and so on. Work done by the four PFIs shows that that is the most effective way of developing private sector investment in council housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
PFI investment has been made in a leisure centre in Sefton, libraries in Bournemouth and Brighton, office rationalisation in Copeland, a technology learning centre in Hackney, salt barns in Norfolk, and so on. In those cases, local authorities examined their capital needs. We require all local authorities to conduct an assessment of their capital; they draw up a profile of their capital and work out how to get the best value from their investment in capital projects. Therefore, many of them are reassessing their capital programmes and working out how they can consolidate and bring them together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A raft of projects is planned. Some projects will be for information technology; the programmes of the Department for Education and Employment are specifically for schools. The largest number of credits will be made by the DfEE because it is responsible for schools and seeks to ensure that schools receive the capital investment that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree with the view of the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) that the PFI is the most expensive route to follow. If the expense relates simply to the initial building, he may be right. However, it does not. The contract is for a period of time, and in that time the private sector will take responsibility for the building. In the 1960s, local government put up many buildings—schools, housing and, especially,
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
tower blocks—that were in a desperate state 10 years later. Those buildings created many problems and needed much investment. If they had been built under PFI projects, the responsibility for them would have lain with the private sector and not with the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a PFI is simply about obtaining money to put up a particular building, it will not pass the test that the Treasury or the sponsoring Departments, such as my own, lay down. We expect a PFI to do more than ensure that a building appears on a piece of ground. The transfer of risk and longer-term responsibility gives me the confidence to say that the PFI is not a more expensive way of borrowing money. I do not believe that it would be cheaper in the long run for local government to obtain the money from the public sector procurement process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government organisations are responsible for testing a project fully before they make a PFI proposal. We expect them to make comparisons and to ensure that they have chosen the most effective route. Because other public-private partnerships will be available, we expect them to come up with the most efficient route.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the cost of borrowing money depend on the nature of the risk? A high-risk project will attract higher rates of interest than a low-risk project. If the project is a very high risk, a deal with not be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true of borrowing on the private markets. However, the hon. Member for Torbay seemed to suggest that the money should all come from what we used to call the Public Works Loan Board and that straightforward public sector borrowing would be cheaper. For the initial borrowing, the hon. Gentleman might be right. However, in terms of the whole project, he is most certainly wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us say that Lambeth council receives PFI money for an expensive library project that works well. However, if there is a lack of demand for books in the area, the council might decide to close the library. Will the Minister explain to those of us who do not understand the process what will happen to the library? Will the private contractor simply take it over and turn it into a McDonald's restaurant? Who will take responsibility for the building?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a council did anything like that, it would be in serious trouble with its auditor. The council would have spent public money in drawing up the proposals and sorting them out. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that all these projects have to go through significant testing before they are set up. If he took a longer time scale, such as 20 years, he might say that the library was simply not modern enough to meet the new requirements. If all a library is doing these days is dealing with books, it will not be meeting modern needs and will have to sort itself out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The private sector has an interest in ensuring that its investment is working and going well. It would discuss with the local authority how it could move forward to ensure that the library was in the right place with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
right structure, and that it offered things that encouraged people to use it—so that it was worth while for the public sector. Yes, the private sector will have to look carefully at what it is doing, as it will have to carry out the responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East may remember that his Government were involved in an early PFI in Scotland. It was a hospital which was not wanted. It did not go through such rigorous testing and was not subject to the local government regime which demands best value. That meant that the hospital became redundant. It is now being sold as I understand it, to the public sector at a knock-down price, so that the hospital in whose grounds it was built can develop NHS services to go alongside those that it is already providing.

Anyone—business, and public sector—must understand what risk is about and must ensure that they are taking decisions that are first and foremost in the interests of the people whom the local authority has a duty to serve. If the private sector is working effectively with them and carries out a proper risk analysis, the scenario described by the hon. Gentleman should never happen. If it does, the auditor would be very concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I give the Minister another example? It may answer the question posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East? Croydon tramlink is a local government project. The money has been provided, but there is a sporting chance that the project might go bust if people do not use the tram. What will happen to Croydon tramlink if it goes under?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is somewhat mischievous. I am quite confident that the Croydon tram will go well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that he will because he is determined to improve levels of public transport in that rather crowded area of south London. In many senses, exactly the same would happen on that project as happens now. If a major project does not work, there must be negotiations between the public and private sector to find a way forward. That has happened in scheme after scheme. It happened in Sheffield with its tram, as it has in other areas with other projects. The private sector does not want to walk away from projects, because it will lose its
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
investment. Nor does the publc sector. The two will try to find a way forward. I am sure that that is what will happen with PFIs.

The hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East asked me to explain paragraph 2 in annexe C, and I shall seek to do so. We have changed the capital controls to ensure that good PFI deals do not score against an authority's capital resources. The previous Government introduced a regime of capital control for local government, which determined the amount of capital spend for each authority. We have changed those controls so that the PFI can be used in addition to the capital allowances that we announced when the revenue support grant was determined. However, contracted regular charges must still be paid out of revenue. In other words, revenue costs of capital expenditure have to be met, and the grant will contribute to the capital element of those charges. That is the assurance that local authorities seek.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, charges on capital are paid by local government out of their allocation of revenue support grant, which we take into account in our calculations. The proposed grant is over and above that amount, which is why we produced this separate special grant report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The grant may be recovered if the authority cannot provide verification that it was used as intended. We can also cut off payments if the scheme proves abortive. If the fanciful example of the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East came to pass, the Government would cease to provide the revenue or credit support that we are agreeing today. That would happen if the project ceased to be run for public use or was discontinued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is essentially about taking measures to ensure that local government can act more strategically in bringing into effect its capital asset programme over several years. We believe that the PFI is one means whereby authorities can address the needs of capital investment in their area. The Government are endorsing the PFI by providing support for credit incurred by councils in relation to their on-going revenue costs. The special grant will enable us to pay that money to local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
