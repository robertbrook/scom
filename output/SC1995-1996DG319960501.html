	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has before it four orders. It would be acceptable to debate all of them at once. However, if a member of the Committee objects to that, they can be taken separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Sims. I give an undertaking to colleagues that I shall not keep them in Committee unnecessarily, but I should like the orders to be taken separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then we shall take the orders in the order in which they have been printed for discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.32 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Sir Nicholas Bonsor)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Partnership and Co-operation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States and the Republic of Belarus) Order 1996.</p></blockquote>
We are to debate four orders. Provided that no member of the Committee has an objection, I propose to generalise. Most, if not all, of what I am about to say will apply to all the orders; I do not think that the Committee would wish me to repeat what I am about to say four times. I hope that the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) will be content with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The orders relate to partnership and co-operation agreements—or PCAs, as I shall call them from now on—which the European Communities and their member states signed in June 1994 with Moldova and in 1995 with Belarus—that is the agreement that we are now discussing—Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. They specify the agreements as Community treaties under section 1(3) of the European Communities Act 1972.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreements are mixed agreements. In other words, some of their provisions fall within Community competence and others fall within the competence of member states. That means that, before they can come into force, the agreements must first be ratified by all 15 member states and by Belarus, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. The European Community must also ratify each agreement separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The draft orders must be approved by both Houses so that Community obligations under the agreements may be implemented by the United Kingdom. The orders were approved by the House of Lords on 16 April. If both Houses choose to approve the orders, they will then be submitted to the Privy Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give the Committee some background to the negotiation of the agreements to highlight their main points and to place them in the context of our broader relations with Belarus and the other nations. In doing so, I hope to demonstrate how the agreements make a substantial and practical contribution to the process of reform in those countries. They are good for the four countries and good for our objective of spreading prosperity and security across Europe and into our neighbours in central Asia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Past relations between the European Community and the Soviet Union were governed by a modest trade and co-operation agreement signed in 1989, which provided a basic framework for managing trade relations and the limited co-operation that existed at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the break-up of the Soviet Union, the European Community, under the stewardship of the United Kingdom presidency in 1992, decided to intensify its relations with each of the newly emerged independent states. The situation called for a new kind of relationship, based on partnership and pratical co-operation, to help those countries through the difficult process of fundamental political and economic reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The partnership and co-operation agreements, which are individually tailored to suit the particular requirements of each state, are designed to provide a practical and workable framework for that co-operation. Eventually all the 12 countries of eastern Europe and central Asia are expected to conclude PCAs with the EU. The first such agreements were signed with Ukraine and Russia in June 1994. In 1995, we were one of the first member states to ratify those two agreements. In addition to the four agreements that we are debating today, the EU signed PCAs with Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan on 22 April 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ratification of the PCAs can take years, so it is likely to be some time before the agreements with Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan come into force. To bridge that gap, the European Community has negotiated interim agreements with each country. Those agreements will bring into early effect the trade provisions of the wider PCAs, and thus help to facilitate trade and promote prosperity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the agreements mean in practice is as follows. They aim to intensify political and economic links between the EU and each of the four countries. That will be achieved through regular political contacts, increased trading opportunities and wide-ranging economic co-operation. I shall highlight a few of their most important features.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the agreements envisage regular political dialogue by setting up a framework for regular consultations. That means that there will be a forum for high-level political contacts where anything of concern to the parties can be freely discussed. The agreements also set up co-operation councils in which Ministers will meet once a year to review the agreements and to explore ways of building on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Secondly, the agreements are an important step in building closer trading links. They help to bring the countries concerned closer to the world market economy. In particular, they provide for the mutual abolition of quotas on most goods, for most-favoured nation treatment on tariffs, and for the abolition of discriminatory internal taxes. The agreements are also the first step in a long process of drawing the countries of eastern Europe and central Asia into the international trading system by introducing them to trade rules and disciplines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the PCAs provide for continued economic co-operation under the Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States—TACISprogramme to help entrench real and lasting reform. Fourthly, the agreements help to set up a regulatory framework for trade and investment that, in the long term, will provide a more stable climate in which traders and investors can operate. In particular, they set out terms on which companies can set up in the territory of the other party; and they aim to bring practice into line with the EU' s in important areas such as the protection of intellectual property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The PCAs are explicitly based on respect for democratic principles and human rights. If one of the countries fails to fulfil its obligations under the agreement, the EU may take appropriate measures, including suspension of the PCA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Economically, the former Soviet Union countries had very different starting points for their development, and that gap has remained. We have to distinguish between the co-called European former Soviet Union countries—Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova—on the one hand, and transcaucasian and central Asian countries on the other. That fact is reflected in the agreements; the European group, for instance, has wider agreements that will develop closer political and economic ties. They contain an evolutionary clause opening up the prospect of negotiations in 1998 leading eventually to free trade areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our presidency in the first half of 1998, the UK is likely to launch the review on possible free trade areas with Belarus and Moldova, as well as with Russia and Ukraine. The outcome of the review may not be the same for each of the four countries. A free trade area is, on present trends, a distant prospect, but establishing such a long-term objective provides all those countries with an incentive to undertake the kind of economic reform that we want them to pursue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Helping Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to develop proper, functioning market economies is the best way to support them. The agreements are in their interests—and in ours. They offer a practical example of the European Union serving the purpose that we want it to serve: underpinning European security; encouraging political and economic reform; promoting more open trade; and helping our businesses to explore new markets. Those are the key United Kingdom objectives, and the EU is helping to achieve them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should now like to say a few words about the wider political context in which we are addressing the agreements. We are dealing with countries that are trying to come to terms with their newly acquired
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
national and regional identities and with their place in the international order. The context is one of encouraging democratic regimes in eastern Europe and central Asia that will offer us new partners and guard against a return to former dividing lines. So the agreements are a first important step in the process of creating a framework of relations by drawing the four countries into the international economic system and reducing their relative political isolation from the west.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our objective is to provide a vehicle to draw the countries in question closer to the west and help them to consolidate their political and economic reform. The agreements can be used to influence their behaviour and encourage closer co-operation with the EU. They provide an alternative: it is for the countries concerned to choose between the EU and closer economic integration within the Commonwealth of Independent States, which must, as we have frequently emphasised, be voluntary. It is neither in our interests, nor in those of the countries concerned, for the CIS to be their only option for economic co-operation and development. Indeed, I believe that that would be profoundly dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite slow progress with political and economic reform in Belarus and Moldova, reflected in failure so far to reach a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund, we consider that the best way to influence development in Belarus is to open up avenues of co-operation. The PCAs will help the process along. I shall deal with the other agreements as we come to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it is clearly in our interests that the process of reform in all these countries should succeed. The success of that process does not lie entirely in our hands. Through the agreements, however, the European Union will be making a significant contribution to helping that process along. I therefore ask the Committee to demonstrate its support for the long-term objective by giving its approval to the principle behind the PCAs—in particular, in this instance, the one with Belarus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.42 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Joyce Quin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gateshead, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the thrust of the Minister's comments, and the Opposition welcome the partnership and co-operation agreements that we are discussing. Many of the views advanced by the Minister were expressed in the House when we considered similar agreements with Russia and the Ukraine, and some of these matters have been dealt with in European Standing Committee B and on the Floor of the House. A general welcome is given by the House of Commons to the agreements and to the important task of building political, economic and cultural relationships with the countries concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not happy with the late arrival of many of the relevant documents. The Foreign Office dispatched about 100 pages of material. Because my mail, like that of many other hon. Members, is redirected to the constituency office, the material arrived there this morning, which did not allow much time for proper consideration of these matters. Fortunately, I am familiar with the PCAs that have already been implemented, so the material was not entirely new to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
me, but I think that, for members of the Committee generally, the documentation arrived too late. I do not understand why the material sent to us from the Foreign Office was not available in the Vote Office. All that we could obtain from the Vote Office were the orders for consideration today, rather than the explanatory memoranda from the Department. If the Committee is to be well informed, the documents must reach us in good time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall ask the Minister some questions, with specific reference to Belarus, as we have decided to consider the orders separately. Are problems still outstanding in the discussions taking place between Belarus and the other countries and the European Union? We are aware that, in general, the countries of central and eastern Europe warmly welcome the closer partnership that they are achieving with the countries of the west—and with the countries of the European Union in particular. But we also know that, particularly in the agricultural sector, petty restrictions are often placed on trade between us and the countries of central and eastern Europe. Any members of the Committee who have had contact with those countries in recent months and years will know of the frustrations that they experience in specific areas of trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are always divisions inside the European Union between those who want to be more open in trade and those who want to be less open, but I hope that all members of the Committee agree that if we are to build a positive and constructive relationship with the countries that we are considering, we want the least possible amount of protection. We certainly do not want the common agricultural policy to affect the agricultural economy of those countries, which have so many other problems with which they are trying to deal and to which they must adapt. Did any particularly sensitive areas create problems during negotiations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What discussions has the Minister had with British industry about possible trading opportunities arising from the agreements? For example, we all know that there are tremendous environmental problems in the countries concerned, some of which can be tackled by the use of environmental equipment manufactured in Britain. If we are to have a trade and aid partnership, have the Government identified possibilities for British industry? If so, will the Minister give us details of them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse what the Minister said about political dialogue, which is obviously an important aspect of the agreements. Will he comment on the political contacts that have so far taken place between the European Union and Belarus and the other countries, and on how those initiatives are likely to be built on in the months and years to come?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The partnership and co-operation agreement with Belarus—in common with virtually all other such agreements—contains an interesting chapter that refers to labour conditions. Article 23 talks about the need for employees and workers of Belarus who gain temporary employment in the European Union to be given roughly equal treatment to that which European Union countries give their nationals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
I support that. I do not want workers from Belarus or the other countries to be exploited in European Union countries, but it is an obvious irony that the Government have been so willing to agree to that provision in all the partnership and co-operation agreements, even though they have turned their face so firmly against the posted workers directive—otherwise known as the "Auf Wiedersehen Pet" directive—which would give British workers in Germany and other European Union countries roughly the same terms and conditions as locally employed people. It appears that the Government are prepared to stand up for those rights for workers from Belarus and other countries, but not for British workers in the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recent 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster prompts me to ask one or two questions. The effects of Chernobyl have been especially dramatic in Belarus. Although Chernobyl is in Ukraine, the area affected covers Belarus as well. Indeed, I understand that 70 per cent. of the fall-out affected Belarus. The Government of Belarus have had to spend enormous sums of money to tackle the after-effects of Chernobyl—to clean up the environment and deal with the problems of homeless people and the dramatic loss of income from agricultural land that was so contaminated that no crops could be grown on it. Was that discussed in the context of the partnership and co-operation agreement with Belarus? I wonder whether Belarus is being offered any special assistance to cope with that tremendous economic and environmental disaster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) is especially interested in such matters and, indeed, knows much about them. Those important matters are much in our minds because the 10th anniversary of Chernobyl was last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An agreement on scientific and other forms of co-operation between Belarus and this country was adopted under a bilateral treaty last year. What has been the experience of that agreement? Will it produce fruitful collaboration between us and Belarus in future?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister about this country's political and diplomatic representation in the four countries. Two or three years ago, I had visitors from Moldova who were very put out because British diplomatic representation in Moldova was via the embassy in Moscow; there was no separate presence in Moldova. That problem has been rectified, but can the Minister confirm for the enlightenment of the Committee whether we have separate diplomatic representation in each of the four countries?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When countries become independent—the old Soviet Union no longer exists—it is tactless to treat them as if they were still satellite countries, by having diplomatic representation through the British embassy in Moscow. Despite the cuts that have affected the Foreign Office budget, and because of the huge changes in central and eastern Europe, Britain needs a presence in those countries to establish the closest possible relationship with them. We should not deal with them via Moscow or any other third country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is right. All hon. Members are concerned that the British presence abroad, especially in central and eastern Europe, should be as effective as possible. Indeed, the role of the British Council was debated on the Floor of the House this morning, and concern was expressed about the cuts affecting the council's service in central and eastern Europe. We urge the Government to make the British presence there as effective as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a presence is important for the countries involved, and it is in our long-term economic interest to act in that way. Those western countries that engage in economic recovery and revival in central and eastern Europe and those that develop effective trading, political, environmental and cultural relationships there are likely to have the most fruitful economic relationships with them in the long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many ways, the British effort so far has been disappointing, especially compared with that of Germany and some other countries. There is widespread interest in all parties in ensuring that our relationship with such countries is as fruitful as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the hon. Member for Linlithgow, I wish to point out that the orders refer to four specific republics, and the Minister has told us of their scope. The hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms Quin) referred to Chernobyl, which she rightly said is in Ukraine. I understand that the hon. Member for Linlithgow, too, may wish to speak about Chernobyl on this or subsequent orders. I am prepared to allow some reference to the impact of the Chernobyl nuclear power station accident on neighbouring states, but I hope that hon. Members will relate their remarks to economic cooperation and technical assistance, which are part of the subject matter of the orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.55 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Chernobyl is specifically mentioned in the papers sent to us about Belarus under the heading of "Energy and Environment". I do not wish to criticise, because it is to its credit that the Foreign Office has taken enormous trouble over relations with Ukraine. I have been invited five times to speak to the incoming delegations from the Rada, as have others of my hon. Friends. I put it on record that the actions of the Foreign Office in relation to the successor states of the Soviet Union are to its credit. The Minister is a member of the all-party central Asian group and I know that he takes a personal interest in such matters. My questions are not asked in a spirit of criticism. I checked with the Clerks Department beforehand, and I believe that my questions are relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start by setting the background. I shall quote a letter that I received from the Prime Minister in answer to a
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
letter that I wrote to him at the beginning of April. To avoid misunderstandings, one should not truncate prime ministerial letters. The letter stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At the 1992 Munich Summit the G7 launched an action programme to improve the safety of the Soviet-designed reactors of the Former Soviet Union and the Central and Eastern European countries. Much of the early phase of this effort has consisted of design studies with a view to defining the main safety issues to be addressed, and establishing priorities for remedial measures. This process has enabled Western experts to gain a greater understanding of these reactors than had previously been possible. In the light of studies on the RBMKs, an international consortium of technical experts has concluded that, given the safety improvements made by the countries concerned, it is unlikely that there could be a repeat of the 1986 Chernobyl accident."</p></blockquote>
The Prime Minister's letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This does not mean that the design and operational standards of these reactors, and the regulatory regimes applying to them, have yet reached internationally recognised safety levels. The G7 countries remain keen that the International Financial Institutions should continue to work with the countries concerned to develop energy strategies which will guarantee continuous energy supply while enabling the RBMK reactors (and the older generation of VVER 230 designs) to be closed as soon as practicable."</p></blockquote>
My first question is whether we could have some clarification on which international institutions the Prime Minister had in mind and what exactly they will do. Frankly, that was not clear—at least, not to me—from the summary of the summit sent to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister's letter continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At the same time, we are seeking to ensure, for example through conditions in Nuclear Safety Account agreements, that proper licensing arrangements are in place which will provide for an acceptable level of safety for as long as these reactors continue to operate. As with Ukraine, which has promised to close Chernobyl by the year 2000, the willingness of the countries concerned to agree to early closure of these higher risk units depends in large part on their ability to meet their energy supply needs in other ways. Until the plants can be closed, it remains essential that the West should continue to provide technical assistance to increase safety standards."</p></blockquote>
That raises a crucial question about the time scale that we are told should continue to exist for the plants. What do the British Government have in mind, as the matter is of considerable concern not only in the successor states to the Soviet Union, but in Austria, which borders Czechoslovakia, where there are three somewhat questionable power stations? Those who might be affected by Kozloduy in Bulgaria are also concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the Declaration from last week's Summit on Nuclear Safety and Security, Russia committed itself to closure of nuclear plant which cannot reach acceptable safety standards, and to work with Western countries to improve safety at these plants in the interim."</p></blockquote>
What exactly are we going to do? Is this an opportunity to flesh out precisely what the summiteers have in mind?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put on the record the questions of which I gave notice to the Minister. First, what plans are there to deal with the treatment of thyroid cancers in children in Belarus, Ukraine and the Russian Federation? Conservative estimates predict that a few per cent. of approximately 10,000 children will develop the disease. Provision is needed for a good many more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is an expected increase in leukaemia that has not materialised and may not do so. How are the authorities planning to deal with it? Do we have any obligations in the matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Thirdly, more research is needed into health effects in the area. What plans do the authorities have to initiate that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the sarcophagus encasing the reactor where the accident occurred is crumbling. What measures are being considered to deal with that? Currently, the authorities are hoping that the west will supply expertise and finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifthly, the west is pressing the Russian authorities to close the other reactors that are still operating at the Chernobyl site. What plans are there for that, and when is it likely to happen?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sixthly, the Russian policy on radioactive waste is in its infancy. Currently, much is dumped in the Barents sea and has been reported to be contaminating nearby areas. A coherent policy is urgently needed. What plans are there to secure that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seventhly, there have recently been large fires in several villages around Chernobyl, which have led to radioactive particles being released into the atmosphere and spreading contamination. How are those and future similar events to be dealt with, and in what way can we help in such matters?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should declare an interest—if interest it be. For 28 years, I have been a weekly columnist with the 
	<i>New Scientist,</i> and I have talked a good deal to my colleagues, who are deeply interested—as, indeed, are other journalists, such as Michael Binyon of 
	<i>The Times</i>—in the on-going problems that are encapsulated by Chernobyl. Again, I have given notice, as I thought it sensible to refer the Minister to the background in the article so that I did not take up the committee's time endlessly. I shall go through the articles seriatim, which might be the best approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 
	<i>New Scientist</i> dated 27 January, there was an article headed "Russia's uranium—too tempting to resist". Is there any question of the purchase by western Europe—ourselves in particular—of highly enriched uranium from Belarus, Russia or Ukraine for the research reactors?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 2 March, on page 7 of the 
	<i>New Scientist,</i> there was a long explanation of the problem of contamination of fish through icebergs. That raises the issue of the actions of the successor states. Do the Government have an interim reaction to the situation? Is the problem as serious as it is made out to be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 23 March, under the heading, "Chernobyl floods put millions at risk", there was a serious series of charges—I do not know whether that is the right word—of destruction of the environment relating to floods carrying radioactive waste downstream on the Dnepr. I rang Downing street to ask whether the Prime Minister's advisers would consider raising with their Russian counterparts at the G8 summit in Moscow two questions of mine about Lake Kojanovskoe, where radioactivity levels are apparently 60 times higher than the European Union safety limit. If that report is accurate, that is a very serious matter, because people in Belarus, Ukraine and the Russian Federation eat fish from that lake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was asserted on 23 March that 9 million Ukrainians are drinking unsafe water and that the whole Dnepr
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
catchment area is at risk. Reference is made to a report by the Italian environment department, under Umberto Sansone, which says that strontium and plutonium are present at a level of 380 terabecquerels. What is the view of the Minister's advisers on that and on the related problems of the leaching of ground water and the mobility of caesium 137 through peat?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 6 April, an article appeared on page 10 under the heading, "West changes tune on Soviet reactors". It said that there had been a change of decision and that, rather than closing down 15 Chernobyl-type reactors, extra safety equipment would be used to prolong their operating lives. I understand that Michael Hyns, who co-chairs the consortium, has expressed great concern, as has the German environment Minister, Angela Merkel. Have the Government considered the U-turn—as it would be called in headline form—on Chernobyl-type reactors? There may well be a good reason for it but I should appreciate some comment on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 20 April, a leader on page 3 entitled "Russia's dangerous game", referred to the nuclear anarchy in the former Soviet Union, commenting in particular on the arrest of Alexander Nikitin. He was arrested on the grounds of revealing state secrets, but it seems from press reports that he was trying to alert his fellow countrymen to real dangers. Having read the article before the Prime Minister went to Moscow, I rang Downing Street to ask whether inquiries could be made about Mr. Nikitin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also refer the Minister and his advisers to an article entitled, "Russian secrecy could sink nuclear aid", which appeared on page 4 of 
	<i>New Scientist</i> on 20 April. Are strings being attached to nuclear aid because of Russian unwillingness to give information to the west? I do not immediately jump to the conclusion that our Government or any other are wrong in this. It may be that if people are not prepared to be candid, they cannot expect aid, but I should like some comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 27 April, under the heading, "Mutation rate doubled in Chernobyl's children", 
	<i>New Scientist</i> referred to damage to both sperm and ova. I contacted Alec Jeffreys, who is well known to the parliamentary scientific committee and who did such distinguished work on DNA fingerprinting and much else at the university of Leicester. 
	<i>New Scientist</i> stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The team produced DNA fingerprints from the blood samples using the forensic technique developed by Alec Jeffreys at the University of Leicester. Any fragment of DNA in a fingerprint that could not be attributed to the child's parents was defined as 'mutant'. In all cases, the possibility that the alleged father was not the true father was ruled out. The rate of mutation among the Belarussian children was then compared with that in 105 uncontaminated families in Britain.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'We found a statistically significant, twofold increase in mutation frequency in the offspring of irradiated parents,' says the leader of the study, Yuri Dubrova, a senior research fellow from the Vavilov Institute of General Genetics at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow. He also found that the number of mutations in the children correlated closely with the level of radioactive contamination to which their parents had been exposed. The implication is that radiation caused permanent mutations in the parents' germ cells, their sperm and ova, which will be passed down from generation to generation".</p></blockquote>
If that is true, it is deplorable and frightening, and again I ask for comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You have been very lenient with me, Mr. Sims. It would be ridiculous to expect detailed answers to all my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0251">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
questions and I do not. I repeat that, in asking those questions, there is not a whiff of criticism, but the matter is of overwhelming human concern and—in view of the results of Chernobyl in the western isles—British national interest. I hope that the Minister will tell us what he reasonably can and I thank my colleagues for their patience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.13 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a veritable barrage of questions and I shall try to answer them today. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will take a later opportunity to pursue them with me. I shall happily answer in writing anything that I cannot cover which he considers to be urgent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start with the questions raised by the hon. Member for Gateshead, East. The delay occurred because the Foreign Office did not know who would be on the Committee until last Friday evening and it was not possible to supply the Committee with the substantial amount of necessary documentation. The delay was inevitable and the hon. Lady must take that up with the parliamentary officers rather than the Foreign Office with a view to obtaining better notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the substance of the order, the hon. Lady asked about petty regulations. That is an enormous problem throughout the former Soviet Union. We hope that the partnership and co-operation agreements will be a step towards harmonising the regulations and standards between the new countries and the former Soviet Union countries with which we are concluding them. That is a step in the right direction, but British businessmen in those areas are likely to face substantial problems for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked about trading opportunities in Belarus, which are mostly related to agriculture and agricultural products. Belarus is still an undeveloped economy, but I hope that it will improve. There are greater opportunities in some of the other countries, particularly in Kazakhstan, where there are substantial oil and mineral resources. British companies have considerable expertise for obtaining those resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked also about workers' rights, but I did not take her point because PACs give national rights to the workers of Belarus, who will therefore enjoy the same rights that other EU workers enjoy. We are not giving away anything of which our own citizens cannot take advantage under other arrangements. As for nuclear activities in Belarus, I can tell the hon. Lady that no specific arrangements have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On diplomatic representation, we have an embassy in Belarus and Kazakhstan. I opened our embassy in Belarus last year. A little later in the year, the Belarussian embassy opened in London with a staff of six. In Kazakhstan too, we have a good strong embassy in Almaty, but we do not have one in Moldova or Kyrgyzstan, a small underdeveloped country. It would be nice to have an embassy in Moldova but providing so many new diplomatic missions in former Soviet Union states is an enormous drain on resources. We have to prioritise and see what we can do. We are not losing out much on business opportunities or influence in those two countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Wantage (Mr. Jackson) asked whether the status of Belarus as an independent nation was affected by its agreement with Moscow. It is affected, but both presidents emphasise that Belarus is an independent nation. It does not affect the weight of the PTA or its status as a bilateral agreement. I am concerned, however, about the increasing drawback into the Russian heart which Belarus is taking. It would be good if the west could ensure that she does not turn her back on us and return to a Soviet style of relationship with Russia. Agreements help to keep the door open and make it harder for Russia to restore Belarus as a satellite state. We must watch carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow made many points. He asked first about Chernobyl, but I cannot answer in detail his question about international institutions. International financial institutions will be involved in providing nearly $3 billion—the part of the agreement that was reached. The Ukrainian Government have undertaken to close Chernobyl by the year 2000, which is a substantial step forward. If they can keep to that programme, the safety of a vast chunk of Europe that is still under threat from the reactors on the Chernobyl site will certainly be enhanced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I referred to the incoming Rada delegations which, to its credit, were organised by the Foreign Office. I welcome the important groups of Ukrainians who visited this country. When asked about the closing of Chernobyl, the answer they gave was, "Where on earth are we going to get our electricity from?" I hope that Chernobyl will be closed by the year 2000 but, from what I was told by the Ukrainians, I very much doubt it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That undertaking was given by President Kuchma, and we shall attempt to hold him to it. About 80 per cent. of the Ukraine's energy requirements are provided by Russia. That is one of the reasons why Russia has such a strong stranglehold on that country. Chernobyl is a substantial supplier of energy, and alternative means will have to be found. That is not an impossible hurdle to surmount within the next five years. The closure of Chernobyl is extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow mentioned other nuclear power stations in Russia. We are concerned because all RBMK reactors are dangerous. Several of the type 1,000 and two of the type 1,500 reactors are still operating in Russia. We consider the type 1,000 reactor to be profoundly dangerous. We want such reactors closed as soon as possible. All the western aid, and particularly the technical assistance, that we are channeling towards Russia is geared towards securing the closure of those reactors as soon as possible. It is no part of western policy to keep them open for longer than is inevitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised other nuclear issues. He mentioned the danger of contamination, and particularly that coming from the Russian navy's nuclear submarines. It is unlikely that Russia will go back on its undertakings. It is usually rather good at keeping them, and it has undertaken to abide by the 1993 convention against the dumping of radioactive material at sea. In
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
those circumstances, it is unlikely that the rumours that we heard at the weekend that Russia is contemplating dumping 20 such submarines are true. As such dumping is unlikely to occur, there will be no knock-on effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the arrest of Captain Nikitin, which was an unfortunate incident. It is an internal matter for the Russian authorities, but it is being pursued by the Norwegian officials who were responsible for the operator for whom Nikitin was working at the time. We shall have to wait to see whether Captain Nikitin is given a proper trial. We sincerely hope that he will be, and we shall maintain pressure on the Russians to ensure that they fulfil all the necessary steps to ensure justice and that there will not be a return to an old-style kangaroo court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the contamination of Lake Kojanovskoe. I do not believe that the position is necessarily as bad as has been rumoured in the press. It is too early for us to assess what may be needed to put matters right. An EU-financed study is being undertaken, which I hope will deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, the possibility of icebergs becoming contaminated by radioactive waste is being watched carefully. Our technical advice is that that is unlikely to cause any danger to marine life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sale of Russian highly enriched uranium to Euratom is supported by the Government. The material in question is unirradiated and from sources other than Russian weapons' programmes, although it does include material from its space programme. Processing of such material involves the removal of molybdenum. That is necessary before the material can be used as research reactor fuel. Radioactive waste arising from the processing of such fuel is insignificant. Therefore, we do not see it constituting any danger. We support Euratom's desire to buy such material and to have it processed at, possibly, Dounreay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear the hon. Gentleman say that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the sad issue of the effect of radiation disease on children and adults in Belarus, there is not much that the United Kingdom can do. We try to give help through the World Health Organisation and other international agencies. I know that the WHO is considering the effect of iodine tablets and that it is trying to assess how it may be able to assist future sufferers. It seems, however, that not much can be done for the many people who are currently suffering in Belarus and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the Chernobyl sarcophagus, because I do not think that I dealt with the matter. We acknowledge that renewing the sarcophagus is essential to the mid
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
and long-term plans for decommissioning, but we must await the results of the EU-funded study, which is currently under way, before we know exactly what that will involve. Likewise on the Chernobyl fire, we are reasonably confident that there was no significant spread of radioactivity, nor will there be, and that the fire is now out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that cover the villages and is the Minister referring to the fires in them, which have been creating trouble?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am told that it does. If I have misunderstood, I shall get back to the hon. Gentleman. I hope that I have covered most of the detail that he wanted me to deal with today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the order. It is a significant step forward in helping to draw Belarus towards the west and the EU and in keeping it safer from the clutches of the CIS, into which it might be pulled back unwillingly.

I think that I covered in detail most, if not all, of the points when I spoke to the first order. I do not need to deal with the one or two minor differences between the arrangements for Kazakhstan and for Belarus. I should mention that Kazakhstan has most favoured nation status—a national status—but that is the only significant difference between the two orders. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some months ago, Leonid Kuchma, president of Ukraine, paid an official visit to Britain. He gave a rather impressive address in the Jubilee Room of the House and, after he had finished, the chairman threw the meeting open to questions. I think that I was the second questioner and I spoke to Mr. Kuchma not as president, but in his previous incarnation of technical director of Baikonur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
I can say only that Mr. Kuchma paused for quite a long time and said, "This is an emotional subject for me." He gave a quiet, moving account of how he had devoted the best years of his life to building up Baikonur—it was the unit that launched Gagarin—but that it was all coming to bits. He added that there was still a good deal of important hardware there and suggested that the teams and their expertise had not been entirely broken up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Kuchma went on to say that a good deal could still be done with western co-operation in relation to the space programme and much other technology. That was brought to the attention of the Government at the time. This is a difficult area and I do not know what kind of co-operation would be practical and sensible in the present circumstances. I asked the Government if, in our relations with Kazakhstan, anything had been said about technical co-operation on what was once a famous scientific establishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that issue. There is not a great deal that we can do to assist. I understand that Baikonur is still being used and is still usable, although it has deteriorated substantially through lack of funding. There has been no request from Russia for western assistance to try to remedy that and it is a matter for Russia and Kazakhstan to work out for themselves. I will keep an eye on that matter and I fully accept what the hon. Gentleman said about Baikonur's value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is very like the order relating to Belarus. The primary distinction between their arrangements and those for Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan is that we are further forward, as I said in my opening statement, in bringing them towards Europe. There is the possibility of moving on to a free trade agreement in due course. The only other difference is that Belarus has a nuclear smuggling clause and Moldova does not. Both have a consultation clause on anti-dumping, and Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan do not. Moldova and Belarus enjoy national treatment, as opposed to the most favoured nation treatment of the other two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not take up much of the Committee's time. In the 1980s, there was a good system whereby, each autumn, Members from both parties spent a week at the United Nations. I was lucky enough to go in the early 1980s—a time when there was great trouble and difference of opinion over the Afghan situation. I strongly expressed a minority view on Afghanistan to Sir Anthony Parsons, who was then our ambassador at the United Nations. He is a man of wide views and treats with extreme courtesy and great charm those who have views different from his own and those of the Government. He said to me, "As you hold those views, I will arrange for you to see my friend, Oleg Tryanovsky", who was the Russian representative at the United Nations at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I went to what I can only describe as the fortress in New York that was then the Russian United Nations centre. After talking at considerable length and in great detail, the charming Oleg Tryanovsky said, "Tomorrow, I will arrange for you to see my colleague, who is the deputy Prime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic. She will tell you about the situation in Afghanistan, because the Kyrgyzis have relations over the border, and they will give you a perspective that you probably do not have."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I went back to the Russian delegation, arranged by Sir Anthony Parsons. I spent a fascinating hour and a half with the deputy Prime Minister, whom I can only describe as a 6 ft 2 in white Chinese-looking lady of great beauty and enormous presence. She told me at length that she grew in her home village the best apricots in the world, and that if I did not believe that, there was no question that she grew the best walnuts in the world. She also told me all about her goats and sheep. Unfortunately, it was not possible to accept the invitation to go to the Kyrgyz Republic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have always been curious about these fascinating mountain people, so vividly described, who, one reads, are having problems. Will the Minister tell us what our

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
relations with the Kyrgyz Republic are? My Dad was a member of the Royal Central Asian Society, so perhaps it is in the blood. I would like any information that is readily available, because I think that we should have relations with all the successor states to the Soviet Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that enlightening speech about Kyrgystan which, unfortunately, I have not yet had a chance to visit. However, my predecessor, now the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, went there, and three other Ministers have also been in the past three years, so we are doing our best to look after Kyrgystan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the enlightenment of those members of the Committee who do not know a great deal about that country—I would have included myself in that number until extremely recently—it is the size of England and Scotland, with a population of 4.4 million. It is very enlightened, by central Caucasian standards: President Akaev runs a fairly liberal system, with parliamentary representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
It is a very pleasant country, and we are on very good terms with it. Our ambassador in Almaty is accredited across to Kyrgystan and keeps in close touch. Kyrgystan does not yet have a representative here, but I hope that one will arrive before long. We do not do a great deal of trade, but the prospect of walnuts and apricots is opening up before our eyes. I hope that we shall have a very close and good relationship with Kyrgystan; she is certainly developing in the right way, and all the signs are encouraging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With its mountains, its goats and its population of 4.4 million, Kyrgystan is ideal for twinning with Scotland or Tyneside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
