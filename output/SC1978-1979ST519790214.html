	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Nurses and Enrolled Nurses (Amendment) Rules Approval Instrument 1979 (S.I. No. 49).</p></blockquote>
I should like to question the Minister of State on one or two points that occurred to the Opposition when we saw this statutory instrument. Normally when a statutory authority seeks to make minor changes to its own rules and to lay them before the House, it may not attract the attention of the House. In this case the statutory authority is about to undergo a considerable metamorphosis and to take other professions under its wing. Therefore, any rules that it might seek to change today may be taken as the basis on which the new Central Council will base its rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful to the Minister for coming to answer our questions. We hope that he will explain why the new rules have been brought forward at this time when the General Nursing Council may exist for only two years or so in its present state. Costly changes would have been avoided had the Briggs recommendations been implemented earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the explanatory note, paragraphs 
	<i>(a)</i> and 
	<i>(b)</i> deal with the cessation of reduction in training periods for the general register. We would like to know whether that means a cessation of reduction in the training period for those specialising in midwifery, ophthalmic or orthopaedic nursing or holders of the Thoracic Nursing Certificate. Is there now a surplus of individuals wanting to train in the profession? Has the Council more candidates to choose from? Is the training in the other professions not sufficient to obtain the General Nursing Certificate? We would be grateful if the Minister would give us a little more information about those two paragraphs in the Explanatory Note.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"cessation of discretion to remove from the roll the name of a person whose name is or has been included in the register".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
What is the intention behind this? Does it mean that the General Nursing Council can no longer remove an individual's name from the register unless there is a finding by a disciplinary committee? That may be an advance provision in view of the new legislation coming in following the Briggs recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we should like to know why it is intended to reduce the number of attempts allowed for entry into the final state written examination. It may be that more candidates are coming forward for training than there have been previously and it is not thought necessary to waste public money on allowing candidates an extra year's training to pass the examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, we query in paragraph (
	<i>g</i>) the
	<br><blockquote><p>"increase in the amount of fees payable by persons trained outside the United Kingdom".</p></blockquote>
It seems a large increase. Is it due to the fact that fees have not been increased for a long time, or is some extra increase in expenditure envisaged as a result of further tests and so on which will be necessary when the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Bill comes in? The increase is from £6 to £14 in the first instance, and a lesser increase from £17 to £18.70 in the second instance. May we have an explanation of that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I come to the badges. We do not yet know what the new name for the state enrolled nurse will be. Who will be involved in the extra expense of changing the badges? Will state enrolled nurses welcome the fact that, for perhaps the last two years of their existence, they will have to pay more for this badge?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister of State will, if possible, let us have more information about the instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.38 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Mr. Roland Moyle)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to answer a number of points of doubt on these regulations. Looking round me, I see that, despite the small attendance, several Briggs veteran faces are present, although I regret that my hon. Friend the Member for Preston, South (Mr. Thome) and the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Hodgson) are not here—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Laurie Pavitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or my hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Dr. Miller).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But those two particularly, as a number of caustic remarks were passed about the negative procedure for statutory instruments when we were dealing with the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was felt that statutory instruments were passed through without anyone noticing them, and even if they were noticed the Government did not provide time for their debate. So I want to emphasise, at this juncture, that here we have a statutory instrument being dealt with under the negative procedure. Its passage through the House has been noticed, and we are debating it. I believe that the same procedure will take place when the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Bill is on the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the general context of these regulations, the hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) asked how the matter related to the Briggs report and why we were taking this step, when, he assumed, the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Bill would be on the statute book. I feel that these are important points and should be answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the General Nursing Council planned to introduce these alterations to rules and regulations in 1977, before it was known that there would be any legislation on the Briggs report. The rules would have been introduced some time ago but for a lengthy period of consultation which the General Nursing Council undertook.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is that we cannot assume that their lordships will agree with us on the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Bill. We must assume, for all practical purposes, that their lordships are free to either accept or reject the Bill, and if they take the latter course the Bill will not get on the statute book. There is also the question of the possible intervention of a General Election. We do not know when it will take place, although it will obviously be some time between now and November. It might interfere with the passage of the Bill, and that is another reason why it might not reach the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, if the Bill were badly amended in the House of Lords—badly amended in the judgment of the nursing professions— the nursing professions themselves might not want the Bill to become law. So, there are those reasons for uncertainty. We have decided, therefore, that the best policy is "business as usual" until we know what Parliament will decide with e gard to the Nurses, Midwives and Health
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Visitors Bill. That is why we are bringing forward the rules. But even if the Bill becomes law, there will be a period of transition, which will not be short. At this juncture, I cannot estimate how long it will be, but, allowing for passage, Royal Assent, making arrangements about appointed days and so on, and for a handover period, a minimum of 18 months seems likely. Indeed, it might be a little longer before the Central Nursing Council can turn its attention to the matters dealt with in these rules, and propound practical solutions for inclusion in the new sets of rules which will flow from the Central Nursing Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background. Then, we must consider what will be the effect of these rules on the position of the nursing professions with regard to the new machinery which might be set up under the Bill. Broadly speaking, it will have no practical impact. The rules which we make today will become part of the body of rules which will be inherited by the Central Nursing Council. Later, when the Central Nursing Council has decided what should succeed the existing rules under the present clause 22 of the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Bill, they could be modified and repealed. So, if some of the new bodies brought under the Central Nursing Council do not like the rules which we pass this morning, they will be in a position, when the Central Nursing Council is set up, to propose changes to those rules. If the proposals are accepted they could be made effective by the normal rule-making processes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the specific points raised by the hon. Member for Wells. The cost of these measures is nil. The limitation of training which follows the reduction in the number of attempts at an examination might lead to a modest reduction in the overall cost of measures administered under these rules. Indeed, the whole object of the rule relating to badges for State enrolled nurses is to produce a cheaper, not more expensive badge. The charge on State enrolled nurses would thereby be modestly reduced. That is the object of the exercise, but what otherwise happens largely depends on the state of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised the question of the cessation of reduction in training periods. He asked if it meant that the nurses who qualified in the various specialised branches of nursing had pre-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0521">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
viously had a shorter training period. He asked whether it would be lengthened and why we were trying to do this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If nurses undertake their specialist training first, under the present dispensation they can reduce their basic nurse training period, if that follows their specialised training, by varying periods of time. In other words, there is direct incentive for thoracic nurses, orthopaedic nurses and others mentioned in the rules, to undertake their specialised training first, and then to carry on with their general training afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who served on the Standing Committee on the Bill will realise that the whole doctrine of nurse training is now exactly the reverse. Nurses should undertake their basic training first and then move on to their specialised training. Against that background, the General Nursing Council wishes to remove any incentive for people to do their specialised training before their basic training. That is why the cessation in the reduction of training periods has occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was the question about the removal of the discretion to remove from the roll a person to be placed on the register. In practice, it has been found that a State enrolled nurse who undertakes further training and becomes a State registered nurse, and who then has her name removed from the roll if she tries to obtain employment overseas, often finds that she has undertaken only a short period of training for entry in the register. In consequence, employers abroad may say that she ought to undertake further training in order to meet their requirements. This rule has therefore been a bit of a restriction on State registered nurses in certain cases, although fully qualified, in obtaining employment abroad. The object of the alteration is to achieve removal of that restriction and allow all the State registered nurses to obtain employment abroad simply on their State registered nurse qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked why it was intended to reduce the number of attempts at an examination. The reason is that, broadly speaking, considering the numbers of nurses who wish to qualify as both State registered nurses and State enrolled nurses, this fourth attempt at an examination, in the case of a State registered nurse, preceded by a further six months' refresher training; and a third attempt at the exam,
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
also preceded by refresher training, in the case of a State enrolled nurse has been found not to be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some figures for selected months in 1976,1977 and 1978 which give statistics of fourth attempts at State final written examinations. For example, in February 1976, only 49 candidates attempted the exam for the fourth time. About half of them—24—failed. In February 1977, 35 candidates attempted the State registered nurse exam for the fourth time, and 16 of them failed. In February 1978, 19 candidates attempted the examination for the fourth time and 10 of them failed. In other words, the numbers who try for the fourth time are rapidly reducing, and even at the fourth attempt, half of them fail. In the circumstances, it is felt by the General Nursing Council that it can do away with the fourth and third attempts in the case of SRN and SEN respectively. In view of those figures, I do not believe that we can quarrel with the Council's judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the object of the admission fee for overseas students is to cover the average administrative costs of processing them so that they can practice in this country. The best assessment is that the figure now mentioned will cover those costs. The costs of overseas students and their admission fees are covered by section 4 of the Nurses Act 1957, not section 3, which relates to the fees for home students. Different principles have always been adopted for overseas students compared with home students. Whether that was intended in the first place by Parliament I do not know, but, as a result of dealing with the two in separate sections, two different sets of principles for dealing with fees have evolved. That is why the fee is being increased. It is a sharp increase, but it is entirely due to the necessity to meet the administrative costs of processing these students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have answered all the questions which the hon. Gentleman posed. If other members of the Committee have any further queries, I shall do my best to answer them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.52 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Laurie Pavitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I raise a point of guidance for you, Mr. Blenkinsop, which you may consider worth passing on. Once upon a time, when public expenditure was perhaps more available, biros were provided on the desks in Standing Committees. Clearly, that was a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0522">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
waste of money because a large number of surplus biros were to be found around the Palace of Westminster. However, from time to time an hon. Member—myself, for instance—forgets to bring a pen. Therefore, it might be useful if one or two biros were available. I notice that already some kindness has been shown on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are always helpful comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise a matter that my right hon. Friend mentioned. 1, too, regret the absence of some of my colleagues on this occasion, including the hon. Member for Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan). It does not seem quite right when he is not in his place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that I entirely accept the procedure on the instrument. This morning, we can either accept or reject the motion that we have examined the instrument. In any case, the instrument comes into operation on 22 February 1979. We have the opportunity of commenting, but, unless comment is so forceful that the instrument is withdrawn, we are unable to half its progress. We can accept that we have looked at it or we can say that we have not looked at it, but we cannot halt it in its tracks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest to what was said on behalf of the General Nursing Council. It will not be outside the immediate recollection of my right hon. Friend that in our discussions on the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Bill it was not always possible to get agreement between the General Nursing Council, especially the General Nursing Council of Scotland, and the Royal College of Nursing and other nursing organisations. We fully understand the point of view of the General Nursing Council on the instrument. But is that view fully acceptable also to the RCN, NUPE and COHSE, which have a large number of nurses who may be affected by this instrument?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo my right hon. Friend's hope that the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Bill, which will affect this instrument, will not be emasculated or changed very much in another place. In my view, imperfect as that Bill is, it would be far better to build regulations covering changes in nursing on that base rather than have to start all over again, which would affect this instrument as we should then be talking in a different context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the explanation of the rise
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
in fees, but I believe that all fees for nurses are too high already. I know the arguments that a professional status is needed, and that comparison is made with the doctors. But when nurses receive the same remuneration as doctors I shall be far happier with the amount of fees that they pay in proportion to the income they receive. The basic disparity between the fees charged for SRNs and SENs on one hand, and by the General Medical Council on the other, rests not so much on the amount of the fees but on the amount of remuneration from which they have to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should prefer to see, rather than the increases specified in this instrument— which I understand that the General Nursing Council wants for its administration—a comparatively nominal fee charged for the retention of professional status. That would be preferable to nurses having to meet these additional costs out of what is already a small pay packet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put one question about the changed organisation for those wishing to study their specialties before or after general training. I believe that it would have been advisable, at the same time as these rules were brought forward, to deal with the anomaly that now exists. Under these rules, it will follow that one takes one's general nursing first and one's specialty afterwards, whereas at present the reverse can happen. But nurses who choose to do that are much disadvantaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a specific case in mind. A nurse qualified as SRN and held a post of ward sister in a teaching hospital, not too far from the Palace of Westminster. After gaining further knowledge and training, she went overseas, and when she came back decided that she would like to specialise in children's nursing. As a result, despite having had rank and status and charge of a ward, she has had to return to the status of a student.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has fortunately been a change in recent years in that she does not have to go back to student pay. But she goes back to student status. Whereas before she had parity with people of the same age group and training, she now finds herself unable to use the same facilities in the hospital as other people of her grade use. A fairly mature nurse, she finds herself demoted with regard to accommodation, mess arrangements and so on. Such cases will occur more often as a result of these rules than before, when often the specialties— such as orthopaedic training or children's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
nursing—were taken first rather than afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The General Nursing Council may not be able to do anything within its own provisions other than give advice about organisation in this respect, because such action would be the responsibility not of the GNC but of the administration of the hospitals. But if nurses are to continue to take their general nursing training first— either as SEN or SRN—and then perhaps decide to seek further training and qualifications, they should be encouraged in every way to do so rather than suffer disadvantages of status and amenities. I hope that that matter may be taken into consideration in quarters where the argument may be effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Having gathered what happened, I had no intention of attempting to join in the high politics on this issue. It seems to me that if one does, one is jumped on by one or other part of the professions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I merely want to ask a simple, perhaps trivial, question. Why is the badge, whether bronze or copper alloy, referred to in the rules at all? It seems farcical. There must be many organisations which, for good reasons of inflation and rising metal prices, have had to change the nature and composition of badges. I am sure that the girl guides and boy scouts associations have had this problem over the past few years. We may have to resort to plastic in due course. But it is farcical that Parliament should have to consider whether the badge worn by a nurse should be made of bronze, copper alloy, stainless steel, plastic or anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that nothing can be done about these rules, but I put in a small plea that, if and when the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Bill is in operation, and new rules have to come from the Central Council, the badge should at least be left out and it should make up its own mind about that matter without asking Parliament for permission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the point raised by the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Braintree (Mr. Newton), although it was raised last.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are being asked to deal with the badge because our predecessors felt that we ought to deal with it. No doubt the hon. Gentleman's remarks will be noted in nursing circles and will be considered when the Central Council gets under way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar point was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Pavitt) when he spoke of a senior nurse wishing to undertake specialised training having to return to student status when she did so. Again, I think that the whole question of student status will be considered by the Central Council when it becomes operative. The Central Council will not have sole control, even allowing for the role of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. Perhaps some of these matters will impinge on the Whitley machinery and will also have to be considered in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was also worried about the high fees for nurses to be registered. He did not specifically restrict his remarks to overseas nurses. The various trade unions representing the nursing profession will have noted my remarks in Committee on the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Bill to the effect that I thought that fees for entry to the register was an appropriate subject for their terms and conditions of service. No doubt an element to that effect will be included in nurse settlements in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That procedure is followed in the case of doctors. The doctors' and dentists' review body always takes into account the size of fees that doctors have to pay to remain on the General Medical Council register. It is regarded as a proper practice expense and is taken into account in the recommendations which are made for any settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also asked whether the Royal College of Nurses, the National Union of Public Employees and the Confederation of Health Service Employees had been consulted on these rules. The National Association of Local Government Officers would also be involved here. The matter was put to the secretary of the management side of the appropriate Whitley Council. I understand that informal consultations were carried out, and the secretary reported that he did not expect an adverse response to the proposals from the staff side of the Whitley machinery. There was consultation throughout the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
whole of the National Health Service via the regional nursing officer network.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also commented on the procedure in general. All I can say is that I will draw his remarks—remarks which I am sure he has made on many similar occasions—to the attention of the Lord President of the Council who has responsibility for these matters in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the remarks made by the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Pavitt). The Opposition wish to see the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Bill become law. If I had to choose between having a General Election now and the Bill becoming law, I should say that a General Election might be more helpful to the country. Nevertheless, I recognise that it will be " business as usual" until that Bill becomes law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The General Nursing Council has to plan changes in the rules far ahead. It cannot assume that Parliament will bend to the wishes of the various nursing interests and pass all the legislation that they wish. However, the rules cannot be held up in anticipation of the Bill becoming law. I am glad to hear that the cost of implementing the rules will be negligible or nil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to question the Minister further whether the purpose of
	<br><blockquote><p>"cessation of reduction in training for the general part of the register"</p></blockquote>
is to reduce the incentive for specialised nursing training taking place before general nursing training. I assume that those wishing to take specialised training for, say, orthopaedic qualifications will have to train for longer than at present. There is a shortage of trained orthopaedic nurses. Therefore, I wonder whether the timing of this change is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may in the long term be necessary to give the professions training in general nursing first and then to go on to specialised training, but I hope that will not slow up the numbers of trained orthopaedic nurses going into full-time work as qualified SRNs. In my area the shortage of orthopaedic nurses is holding up operations. As the Minister knows, important operations take place at the Royal United Bath hospital and, because of the necessity of having a full team available to nurse a patient after an orthopaedic operation, there are long delays and the time of consultants is wasted because orthopaedic
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
nurses are not available. I hope that the Minister will be able to assure me that the implementation of this instrument will not reduce the number of specialist nurses going into the National Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.9 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not willing to play party advantage in these matters. I have no hesitation in saying that, for the good of the nursing profession, I should prefer the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Bill to go through before a General Election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the other matters that were raised. The hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) raised an important point in connection with orthopaedic nurses. If these rules are accepted, orthopaedic nurses will probably have to undergo a longer period of training than heretofore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Department was consulted by the General Nursing Council when the rules were being prepared. We felt that the worry expressed by the hon. Gentleman would arise if this rule were altered in the way proposed by the General Nursing Council. We are anxious to ensure that there are no further bottlenecks in orthopaedic nursing, because that is where waiting lists have the greatest impact. A painful arthritic hip may not necessarily be a fatal or dangerous condition, but it can be excruciatingly painful. In some parts of the country many people have to wait a year or more for operations for the insertion of an artificial hip joint. Certainly, we should not want to add to the delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, we conducted careful soundings in the National Health Service. In particular, we sounded out about half a dozen schools of nursing to get their practical views on the consequences of amending the rules. As a result, we came to the conclusion that there was not likely to be a marked impact or effect on the recruitment or training of orthopaedic nurses, that the resource implications would not be substantial and that there would be no pressure on health authorities to reduce orthopaedic nurse training. Thus we are now quite happy that the rules should be amended in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that there will be no slow-up in the outturn of orthopaedic nurses from the schools? I do not see how that is right. If these rules are brought in, surely fewer nurses will be coming forward for a time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be a brief time to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
take care of the adjustment. We expect no long-term restriction on the number of orthopaedic nurses coming forward compared with the problems that they have to face. We are quite happy for these rules to be promulgated and approved in the manner proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
