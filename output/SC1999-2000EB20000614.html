	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>Broad Economic Policy Guidelines</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the broad economic policy guidelines is to ensure that member states' economic policies are consistent with the goals of the treaty of Rome. That includes non-inflationary economic growth respecting the environment, high employment and social protection and a raised standard of living and quality of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In accordance with article 99(2) of the treaty, the European Commission has adopted a recommendation on the broad economic policy guidelines—BEGs—for the member states and the European Union, for adoption at the Economic and Finance Council on 19 June 2000. The guidelines set out the Commission's views on priorities for the coming year and will, once adopted by ECOFIN in the margins of the Feira European Council, provide the reference text for the Commission and the Council to review economic developments in member states and the EU generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate to discuss the draft recommendations, in which I am more than happy to participate, was requested by the European Scrutiny Committee. I would be most grateful if hon. Members noted carefully that the draft represents the Commission's work only. The draft guidelines have subsequently been discussed and revised by member states as part of the drafting process. I welcome the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) to his seat and say how much I regret that the late finish last night has—apparently—proved too much for him this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK has been keen to develop the role of the BEGs, which are the key economic policy co-ordination tools of the EU. The 2000 guidelines do a good job of reflecting our main priorities, in particular following up the Lisbon Council and promoting the wider economic reform agenda. It is essential that the BEGs reflect fully the importance of structural reform in tackling successfully the challenges of globalisation and competitiveness, promoting employment and social inclusion and improving the performance of the European economies. We have also emphasised the importance of making the objectives sharper, setting milestones for the implementation of reforms, benchmarking good practice and developing structural reform indicators as a priority, and for putting those objectives into practice through policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background to this year's BEGs is an environment in which, as a result of efforts to complete the internal market, previously over-regulated industries have been liberalised and exposed to
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
competitive forces. The Commission notes the successful introduction of the euro and the establishment of a comprehensive framework for economic policy co-ordination. The draft guidelines also note that an increasingly strong economic recovery has taken hold across the EU owing to cyclical factors, supportive macro-economic policies and an improved structural policy environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 2000 BEGs are centred on, and give operational content to, the conclusions on economic subjects of the March 2000 Lisbon Special Economic Council. They are designed to focus on the medium and long-term implications of structural policies and on reforms aimed at promoting economic growth potential, employment and social cohesion, as well as on the transition toward a knowledge-based economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of that focus, the draft guidelines develop four key challenges for European policy: to restore full employment, to promote the transition to a knowledge-based economy, to prepare for population ageing and to improve social cohesion. To achieve those aims, the Commission has proposed specific recommendations under the following broad headings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first aim is to ensure growth and stability-oriented macro-economic policies to position the economy on a sustained, higher, non-inflationary growth and employment path. The second is to maintain sound public finances to allow the full working of automatic stabilisers. The third is to improve the quality of public finances to restrain expenditure and lower the tax burden, and to improve their sustainability for the medium and long term. The fourth is to promote appropriate wage developments by allowing wage-cost developments in member states to reflect differences in economic and employment situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fifth aim is to foster a knowledge-based society by reforming product capital and labour markets to promote essential conditions for innovation and technology diffusion. The sixth is to ensure efficient product markets to reinforce the impulse given to structural reform by the Cardiff process, especially in the markets for services. The seventh is to promote efficient capital markets to improve the allocation of capital and reduce its cost. The eighth is to invigorate labour markets to tackle the problems of employment and fully grasp the benefits of the knowledge-based economy. The final aim is to enhance sustainable development by promoting environmentally friendly technologies and exploiting the efficiency gains of market-based instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission produced a report—for the first time—on the implementation of the 1999 BEGs. According to its recommendation, the guidelines for 2000 have drawn significantly on the findings of the implementation report. The Government believe that that is a very important step in consolidating progress made to date, and it should help to embed the notion of economic reform in Europe in the minds of all concerned. Not only does that help in the overall formulation, presentation and relevance of the guidelines, which allow people to see the results of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0791">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
reform and the changes that are being made, it helps to provide a firmer grounding for the development of the following year's guidelines. For that reason, we strongly support the decision to draw on the findings of the implementation report when developing guidelines for the coming year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's overall assessment is that the implementation of the 1999 guidelines is "encouraging", although it notes that the degree of implementation has varied across member states. It considers that those member states that have pursued a comprehensive reform strategy in line with broad economic guidelines have achieved the best economic performances. Furthermore, last year was the first time that the broad economic guidelines included country-specific recommendations for each member state. They implicitly acknowledge the fact that different states face different and sometimes unique challenges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government share the Commission's decision to emphasise the key objectives of sustainable non-inflationary growth and high levels of employment. Our policies for achieving those are consistent with BEGs. We need sound macro-economic policies that are based on well managed public finances and low inflation; economic reform, including improvements in the workings of goods and services markets; modernisation of the labour market through improved training and by introducing better incentives for the low paid to work; better regulation; and promotion of entrepreneurship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The specific, albeit non-binding, recommendations that apply to the United Kingdom are also consistent with the Government's approach to economic policy. They emphasise the need to secure sound public finances and improve the workings of product, capital and labour markets. The general direction of the recommendations is in line with the Government's stated policy objectives and the measures taken since coming into office. Approving the motion will allow the UK to play a constructive role in encouraging economic reform, which builds on the results of the Lisbon Special European Council, and to participate fully in the important process of economic policy co-ordination as provided for in articles 99 and 104 of the treaty. I look forward to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 11.30 am for questions to the Minister. I remind the Committee that they should be brief and asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for everyone to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by apologising for my late arrival. I wish that I could say that it was due to shock at the contortions that the Economic Secretary had to undergo last night to try to persuade the Finance Bill Committee that the Government had consulted on double tax relief. In fact, it was due to the fact that the Mayor of London has not yet solved traffic problems on the embankment. It is my fault in misjudging that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
My first question—if I am lucky enough to be able to ask others—relates to page 29 of the document. What does the Economic Secretary think that the Commission means when it states that Irish budgetary policy should aim
	<br><blockquote><p>to use budgetary policy to ensure economic stability given the extent of over-heating in the economy?</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the hon. Gentleman's interest in Ireland. Will he clarify specifically his interest in the section of the document on Ireland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for letting me reply, Mrs. Roe, even though it is an unusual proceeding. My interest in Ireland will become apparent when I ask some other questions and also make a speech. I would like to know what the Minister thinks the Commission means by the phrase, because it tells us a great deal about the process. Does the Commission intend, for example, to instruct the Irish to change their fiscal stance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said in my opening remarks, the Commission's guidelines are not instructing anybody to do anything. They are non-binding on member states. It is for the Irish Government to respond in the light of their policies to the guidelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a general emphasis throughout the guidelines on the importance of structural reforms. I mentioned in my opening remarks—I think that the hon. Gentleman was with us by that time—that we have encouraged country-specific guidelines to reflect the differing circumstances in member states. In order to make progress, it is important to emphasise that change is generally achieved only by consensus. All member states signed up to the overall programme of policy reform in Lisbon, which is represented in more detail in the guidelines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a well established tradition of international organisations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, that comment and advise on national economic policy and that it would be quite eccentric if the European Commission did not offer non-binding advice, which should be welcome to each Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. It is important to recognise that the guidelines have undergone a series of processes already. The draft was issued in April. Their general orientation and potential drafting changes were discussed at ECOFIN in May, and they were discussed again at ECOFIN on 5 June. The debate will be concluded at the impending ECOFIN on 19 June. That process has provided people with an opportunity to engage in the overall perspective that we want to be pursued in the European dimension, to which Governments signed up as part of the Lisbon process. It has enabled member states to institute programmes that better reflect their individual positions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Page 7 of the document states that member states broadly face the same challenges. One challenge highlighted is the budgetary impact of an ageing population, which I imagine will be similar in terms of health care, and so on, in all member states. The other end of the spectrum, which differs across member states, is the birth rate. I was in Italy recently, and heard that the birth rate there is declining at a fairly alarming rate. Those member states that have both a growing ageing population and a declining birth rate are likely to face even greater budgetary problems in sustaining public finances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect the Minister to know the comparative birth rates of all member states, but does she agree that it would be useful if such a comparison were published, so that we had a better idea of the structural difficulties that the population-age distribution will cause each member state?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her tolerance of my inability to produce those figures. The annual, iterative process gives us the chance to provide a better setting for the guidelines and to implement them more effectively. I shall certainly bear in mind her suggestion for next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to note that the Italian birth rate is so low that, in 50 or 100 years' time, the Italian population could disappear. I hope that that does not happen, because I like the Italians and want them to remain with us for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in my hon. Friend's presentation of the document. I have some deep concerns about it—most of all about its lack of focus on high unemployment rates in Europe. Will my hon. Friend and the Government be pressing for a higher profile to be given to that serious EU problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The UK has obviously had considerable success in tackling unemployment, with 929,000 more people in work since the Government came to office in 1997. There is clearly a direct connection between the economic policies that we pursue and their outcome—the incentivisation of work and the structural changes that have taken place in the UK economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although my hon. Friend may not be content with the report's emphasis on employment issues, it is nevertheless true that the settings that we used to deal with UK employment issues are the same as the basic structure that underlies much of what is suggested in the broad economic policy guidelines document. It is those structural reforms, with their emphasis on incentivising work and re-skilling people in the new technologies that will help to address the issue of employment in Europe. Indeed, the document shares the UK's aspiration for full employment. As defined on page 6 of the document, the target for employment in Europe is 70 per cent. by 2010. That important policy aim will provide the focus for the economic and structural reforms which we want as much in Europe as in the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In her response to my previous question—I shall return to the matter during the debate—the Minister said that the Commission was not instructing Ireland, and I accept that that is technically correct. Nevertheless, does she agree that the natural interpretation of the phrase on page 29, which I quoted, is that the Commission is at least recommending to Ireland that, notwithstanding its fiscal surplus, it should increase it taxes or decrease its expenditure to ensure economic stability, given the extent of overheating?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what is stated. The hon. Gentleman is reading from the document, and what it says about Ireland. I am not a member of the Irish Government, so I cannot comment on their discussions or their interpretation of the document's words about the Irish economy. I find it a little difficult to answer his question more directly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Lepper 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brighton, Pavilion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I focus my hon. Friend's attention on the United Kingdom section, rather than on that which deals with the Republic of Ireland? Page 44 of the document identifies essential problems with research and development expenditure and with the encouragement of innovation. Will my hon. Friend remind us of some of the measures that the Government are already taking in order to deal with exactly those problems of encouraging more investment in research and development and in innovation, especially in private sector companies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to do so. We have taken a number of significant steps, of which the document is one aspect, to tackle the productivity gap. We want to increase investment, to encourage enterprise and innovation, to improve skills, to secure better competition and regulation and to increase public sector productivity. We have introduced a number of measures in the past few Budgets in order to achieve those aims. In particular, we have increased investment in the economy by supporting venture capital and R and D initiatives, which feed into helping to promote higher technology and riskier businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was highlighted in the recent pre-Budget report and other Budget reports, UK under-performance in business R and D was one of the drivers of the Department of Trade and Industry/Treasury consultation document, which we published in March 1998. Following that, we have acted to improve the climate for business investment by improving commercialisation of university research and development through new venture capital funds and through university challenge funds. New science enterprise centres and the Cambridge-Massachusetts Institute of Technology link—an attempt to learn the United States lessons about science exploitation—have played an important role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also improved incentives for small and medium companies to invest in R and D. The evidence suggests that UK small and medium enterprises perform worse than UK industry in general and in comparison with SMEs in other leading G7 countries. We are, therefore, in a position to improve on our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0793">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
results. This year's Finance Bill, which was debated in Committee only yesterday, introduces the new R and D tax credit for SMEs, which provides cash-flow assistance for investors in research and development, including those which are not yet in taxable profit. It will incentivise people who are just starting out on the road, as well as those who are a little bit further along it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will be able to improve the availability of venture capital through the creation of public-private partnership funds, the UK high technology fund, which will bring together new private sector capital, and Government and European Investment Bank investment. The aim is to raise a total fund of some £125 million to start investing later this year in specialist high-tech venture capital funds. Of course, we are also improving the availability of venture capital for early-stage high technology through the new tax incentive for UK corporates to invest in such SMEs—another subject that was recently discussed in the Finance Bill Standing Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also taking action to improve the skills base and to promote competition. Our emphasis on the importance of the R and D strand is one of the ways in which we are achieving the overall objective of encouraging enterprise and innovation in our economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Page 15 of the document contains a chart that compares venture capital investment in the EU with that in "U", which I think means the US. It appears to show that significant progress is being made in absolute terms, although the EU level is still probably between half and two thirds that of the US.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a discussion on the United Kingdom, page 44 of the report comments that pension funds do not often invest in venture capital, although no bar prevents them from doing so. The issue might be cultural or there might be other aspects of longer-term concern. Will the Minister comment on that matter and say whether she agrees that a more proactive involvement of pension funds in serious venture capital would be welcome?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced in the Budget that Paul Myners would head a review of the future of investment in the UK with an emphasis on pensions. My hon. Friend will be aware that the review is due to report in time for next year's Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with my hon. Friend's point, but we will have to bear in mind the fact that a balance must be struck between risk and encouraging a wider range of investment in pension funds. We all want our pensions to be safe and well invested for our futures. It is therefore important that we study whether we have the balance right. Because it is high-risk, venture capital might not be the natural place for pension fund investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mrs. Roe, for not rising properly to alert you to my desire to ask another question. I admire the Minister's ingenuity—she has
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
turned the debate into a means of telling us about the wonders of the Government's general policy. I might have done the same if I were in her position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to a specific issue raised on page 44 of the report, has the Treasury discussed with the Commission the meaning and implementation of the Commission's recommendation that UK budgetary policy
	<br><blockquote><p>should aim…to keep the underlying the position of the government finances broadly unchanged, taking account of cyclical developments in the economy?</p></blockquote>
Has the Treasury discussed with the Commission the further recommendation that the Chancellor should
	<br><blockquote><p>make sure that any new expenditure or tax initiatives are consistent with this goal?</p></blockquote>
Has the Treasury discussed with the Commission the comprehensive spending review, which obviously relates to those two recommendations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what discussions the hon. Gentleman has in mind. "Discussion" is an open-ended term. Obviously, discussion about the broad economic policy guidelines goes on all the time between member states and with the Commission, as part of the process of achieving a workable and useful document which will deliver for the UK something that is in line with the economic policies that it is important for us and Europe generally to pursue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document says that the underlying position of government finances should be kept broadly unchanged. The Budget did that, locking in fiscal tightening in the next two years to an even greater extent than was projected in Budget 99. The Government remain firmly on track to meet their tough fiscal rules during the economic cycle while releasing substantial new resources for their key service priorities. Net borrowing is projected to remain low in the next five years. Indeed, total net borrowing and net repayments in this fiscal year and the next one will be lower than in any year of the previous Parliament. We are confident that our economic policy is on course and that the guidelines tell us enough about our possible direction, while being easily within the Government's capabilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for her answer to my earlier question. I was pleased that she mentioned full employment as an aspiration. I like to think that an organisation with which I am connected has had a modest role in reintroducing that term into the language of government. It is called the Full Employment Forum. It was founded by a very fine former hon. Member called Bryan Gould. It is of great regret to me that he is no longer a Member of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not find the term "full employment" in the document. Will my hon. Friend do her best to persuade the European Union to consider adopting that term in future documents—and any further versions of the present document—and to state it as a firm objective for the European Union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The topic is discussed in the document under the heading "Restoring full employment"—on page 6 in the version that I have. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0794">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
hope that that is what my hon. Friend hoped for. I welcome his support for full employment, for which he has actively campaigned for some time. It is worth pointing out that decades ago discussion of full employment meant full male employment, but now it is a matter of full employment of working-age men and women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As to female employment, a policy recommendation on page 12 is that member states should
	<br><blockquote><p>pursue policy aiming to reduce gender pay differences due to de facto discrimination.</p></blockquote>
The onus is very much on the individual in the United Kingdom to prove discrimination at a tribunal and in certain sectors there is still a big pay gap between men and women. What new policies might the Government pursue to close the gender pay gap?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Lady's interest in the topic and I know that she is not trying to entice me into early announcements of Government policy direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have done several things to help to tackle the issue. Not the least of those was introducing the national minimum wage. Before it was introduced, many people on very low wages were women. We are using a panoply of Government policies and measures to deal with the problem. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities is tackling those matters as one of the Ministers for women and my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House of Lords and Minister for Women is working on them too. Our policies will have an effect in several ways and we may do other things in future to help to achieve the desirable goal of greater parity in pay between men and women. We have inherited a long-standing disparity, and that is of concern to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are doing will reflect higher educational attainment among girls and women, increased opportunities for education and employment and better support in matters such as child care. That will enable more women to work if they wish, so that more women are engaged in the labour market, and ensure that a greater range of jobs are available and that discrimination does not take place. Obviously, certain measures are already in place, some of them of historical standing, which are designed to address those issues, but we have also introduced our own policies, which will help to further that progression.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although it is noticeable that, in the commentaries on many countries, the Commission takes a cautious view of the dangers of overheating, the first paragraph stresses that growth is even stronger than expected but that, thanks to Government measures to promote employment opportunities, the risk that growth will create further pressures on the labour market is small. Does my hon. Friend welcome the fact that Britain seems to be almost the only country of those assessed where the Commission is not urging the need for labour market reform because it is felt that we have already come a long way? Although we should not be complacent, that reflects the priority that the Government have given to that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we have made such progress in structural reforms, which have included efforts to reform the labour market and to build a stronger economic policy in the UK. We have succeeded in doing that. As a result, we have been able to increase supply and demand for labour. We need member states to concentrate on tax benefit reforms, especially at the lower end of the range of wage distribution, but active labour market policies are in place, which are especially important for the young and long-term unemployed. Clearly, we have a good track record on such matters, for example with the new deal—a major programme that is focused in particular on the young and long-term unemployed. Because of such policies, which are innovations in the UK but would be considered to be extremely innovative in some other EU contexts, we are clearly leading the field. As the report says, that innovation has been among the best in the EU in recent years, and it is clear that there is a direct connection between that and several of the reforms that we have introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the question from the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard), I mentioned the importance of making work more family friendly and raising employment levels among women in Europe. Measures to achieve those objectives have already been adopted in the UK, although more work needs to be done in other European countries. However, I am sure that other countries will look to the developments that have taken place in this country and adopt and adapt them for their own countries in the next few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In her response to my previous question, the Minister said that discussions are taking place all the time to produce a workable and useful version of the document. At what level have those discussions been taking place? Have Ministers or officials been meeting the Commission? If meetings have been taking place with officials, are they officials of the Treasury or of the UK's representatives in Brussels?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman has been a Minister, but it is normal for meetings of all kinds to take place at all times, often informally. They are a regular part of ministerial life, both in the UK and elsewhere. My colleagues and I meet Commissioners and officials, and officials meet their counterparts in the Commission to discuss things, but that is the normal traffic of dialogue between us, as a member state, and the Commission. There have been no meetings in that context, only the usual sort of engagement that goes on all the time between all member states and the Commission. Indeed, I dare say that it would have happened under the previous Government, because it is part of belonging to the EU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made many references to supply-side measures being a way of overcoming unemployment in Europe. Does she agree that a major cause of unemployment in Europe has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0795">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
been the demand side, and that insufficiency of demand—euro-sclerosis and even euro-deflation—has been used in the past?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my hon. Friend agree that one has to look at the demand side, to ensure a sufficiency of consumer demand to allow growth and to increase employment? Europe should therefore look at its macro-economic policies, interest rate policies, fiscal policies and exchange rate policies, to ensure a sufficiency of demand to enable growth to take place. However worthy and useful supply measures may be, they cannot by themselves overcome an insufficiency of demand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that both sides need to be addressed, although in different ways. Europe has constructed a framework for macro-economic stability that is delivering low inflation and stronger growth. The challenge is now to show equal determination and rigour in tackling structural issues, and our success in that will prolong and strengthen the EU cyclical recovery while helping to maintain price stability—policies that my hon. Friend will recognise in the UK context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main challenge is probably to raise employment and productivity to the level of best global practice. That will require a commitment to developing the innovative, knowledge-driven economy that we spoke of earlier. Structural reform is the key to long-term growth. It is important also that markets become more flexible. There is a connection between putting people into work, incentivising employment and maintaining low inflation, and consumers having money to put back into the economy. We spoke earlier about our aspirations for full employment, and my hon. Friend will recognise its importance in this context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the same line of questioning, can the Minister say whether the Commission sent a draft of the document to the Treasury and, if so, did the Treasury comment on it? If those events occurred, when did they happen? Finally, has COREPER discussed the document—formally or informally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a timetable. On 8 May, a draft document was deposited with the Cabinet Office and an explanatory memorandum was requested from the Treasury. The memorandum was signed and sent to both Scrutiny Committees, which debated it. The hon. Gentleman is asking me about our engagements with the Commission, and the normal processes that go on with any EU document—which is that drafts are circulated and discussed in a number of different contexts. Nothing different from the standard procedure happened with this document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Were the documents sent to the Treasury?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, it was discussed at the ECOFIN meetings, and I gave the dates of those meetings earlier. Those dates have not changed as a result of the passage of time. A draft would have been sent to the Treasury before the meetings. Ministers
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
attend meetings with draft and briefing in hand. I cannot imagine why the hon. Gentleman would be interested in exactly when the draft arrived at the Treasury. I am not sure I will be able to furnish him with the information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lepper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the Minister's comments on the various new deals and the influence that they have had on the United Kingdom labour-market issues referred to in the document. The Minister suggested that some of her European counterparts would be interested in the results of the new deal. Can she inform us whether our European partners have made any formal or informal approaches, thereby confirming her perception? If there have been, can she say what those approaches have been?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister agree that the priorities for the United Kingdom recommended on page 45 of the document are an endorsement of our new deal policies? Does she agree that anything that undermines those policies, or any suggestion that they might be ended, will not help us solve the problems in the labour market, which are outlined in the document?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I agree with my hon. Friend, particularly on his last point. The Opposition are not committed to the new deal. Indeed, they would scrap it. The document makes it clear how such a policy would have implications for the success of our economic policy, as seen not only within the United Kingdom, but by those outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom's aim is to create an efficient, flexible and well-functioning market throughout Europe, which can react quickly to change and contribute to an improving economic environment for all our citizens. The Government seek to ensure that the economic reform process remains on track. Through the various peer review processes, which were agreed at Cardiff and Luxembourg, our EU partners share our aim. That answers the particular question my hon. Friend asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All member states signed up to article 98, which was previously 102(a), which says that the member states and the Community shall act in accordance with the principle of an open market economic with free competition, favouring an efficient allocation of resources. At Cardiff, member states agreed that economic reform is essential if the Union is to face successfully the challenges of globalisation, competitiveness and promoting employment and inclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not mentioned inclusion, but that is another feature of the economic and social policies we have been pursuing. The Lisbon conclusions stated that the European Council in Lisbon would agree a new strategic goal for the Union in order to strengthen employment, economic reform, social cohesion as part of a knowledge-based economy. That is another theme we have debated this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A huge consonance exists between the kinds of developments going on in this context, which are represented in the guidelines, and the aspirations that the Government have been developing over the past
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0796">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
few years for the UK economy. The implementation report on the 1999 broad economic policy guidelines described the United Kingdom as a pioneer in labour-market reforms. That is our role in this context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to pursue the Minister on the matter. However, I would like to understand the genesis of the document. Has she at any time sent any written commentary to the Commission on an earlier draft?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not personally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend find it worrying that the Opposition appear interested only in the process relating to, and not the content of, a document about the economic and social policies of the European Union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bemused by their interest in when a document arrived through the Treasury letterbox. Nothing unusual has happened; everything has been in accordance with the usual run of our dealings with other member states. I do not understand the Opposition's attitude, except that I suspect—and I wonder if my hon. Friend shares this suspicion—the hon. Member for West Dorset does not want to debate substantive issues about what is happening in the United Kingdom economy, or the broad economic policy guidelines for the United Kingdom. That debate of course involves difficult issues for the Opposition, such as whether to continue or reconsider their commitment to scrap the new deal—and the predicament of people employed under it if they continued with their current policy. Many difficult questions would arise for them in considering the Government's successful economic policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) is knowledgeable about these matters and knows what he was asking. I am not certain that the Minister knows what is going on, but I shall in due course explain. Meanwhile, I shall pursue the question to which I want concrete answers. We have not had many yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, is the Minister aware of any other Minister having sent the Commission a written commentary on the draft? Secondly, what attitude has the Treasury decided to adopt with respect to the fulfilment of the broad economic guidelines when ECOFIN has adopted them by qualified majority vote?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have carried out the normal processes in the normal way, as I have told the hon. Gentleman many times. I would be fascinated by an explanation of his interest in the question, which is a mystery to me. We have, as ever, pursued our policies in line with the United Kingdom's national interest and our economic and social policies, with which I think the hon. Gentleman is familiar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am confident that as and when my hon. Friend and her colleagues submit a further comment to the European Commission about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
document—one hopes that, as it is a draft, it will be revised—today's thoughtful comments will be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to productivity growth, which is important as it makes higher living standards possible. The graph on page 4 of the document, headed "Trends in living standards and labour productivity", shows productivity growth and GDP per working hour—relative to America, but nevertheless it shows a trend. It also shows a trend in GDP per capita. Productivity has risen faster than output, which has caused unemployment. That brings me back to my earlier point. Is it not important to raise output as well as productivity, so that we can reduce unemployment? Will my hon. Friend make that point in her submission to the Commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We certainly want increasing productivity in the UK. It is important to recognise that there is scope for a faster rise in productivity, which we need to close our productivity gap with some of our main competitors. We are consequently pursuing policies on raising investment in the economy, encouraging enterprise and innovation, which we discussed earlier, and measures to raise the skills base in the UK. Those policies are important. Our children have been sadly underachieving in schools as a result of the previous Government's policies and lack of investment in education. My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North is aware that those problems have been addressed by the Government since we came to power in 1997, with much-increased investment in the education service and improvements in literacy and numeracy at primary level, two key areas on which we focused. Those improvements will hopefully feed through to result in better-qualified and better-equipped young people able to do additional post-19 courses and degrees necessary to skill the work force and provide people with certain employment for the future. All those factors have been important in refocusing public services and the private sector on the need to reskill and to concentrate on closing the productivity gap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Minister's attention to page 10 of the document, in which the Commission recommends that member states, including Ireland and the UK, should meet a budgetary position
	<br><blockquote><p>close to balance or in surplus.</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister tell us whether any of her Treasury officials monitor member states' conformity to that policy guideline? What steps, if any, do the Government intend to take if it transpires that a member state is not conforming to the broad guidelines?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I explained to the hon. Gentleman earlier, the guidelines are not binding on member states. We have been round that track a few times recently. I am not sure what force the hon. Gentleman's question has. The guidelines are drawn up on the basis of the overall framework agreed at Lisbon and in previous European discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0797">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the recommendations relating to labour mobility on page 16 of the document is for the improvement of the portability of pension entitlements. All of us who have worked abroad are familiar with the problem. It is often difficult to move pension provision from one country to another. We are behind many countries in terms of moving provision between companies in Britain. Do the Government agree that promoting pension mobility in and across countries is an important objective in the interest of labour mobility and of individuals who choose to maximise their opportunities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I agree with my hon. Friend. The objective is important and, as he has rightly identified, the first issue to confront us in the UK is the lack of portability in this country for people changing between jobs. We have addressed that problem in several ways through the introduction of stakeholder pensions and through pooled pension investments, which will be developed to go alongside the stakeholder measures. Those measures will increase the ability of people to take their pensions with them. However, it is worth highlighting the fact that women often lose out because they are more likely to leave the labour market temporarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The stakeholder pension allows people on low incomes or not in employment to pay into stakeholder provision. That recognise the many different choices that people have to make about how they structure their work and family lives. Greater flexibility is needed in all provision to reflect the experience of people, particularly women, who take time out, for example, to care for children or elderly relatives. There is some way to go before people engage fully with the financial instruments and pension provisions available to them. The portability of pensions across the borders of member states is one aspect of that greater flexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Page 11 deals with the long-term sustainability of public finance. It gives rise to two brief questions, one of which relates to the previous question. Why is there no mention of the long-term time bomb in EU public pension liabilities? Why does sub-paragraph viii adjure member states to pursue tax co-ordination further? What does she think it means by that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's question about pensions, no single circumstance reflects the approach of all member states to pension provision. Different countries are in different positions. He rightly identifies the UK as being in a different position, but we are not alone in that. The document says that there is a need to ensure the sustainability of public finances in the medium and long term, while taking account of demographic and other long-running structural developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the hon. Gentleman, the broad economic policy guidelines encourage member states to pursue tax co-ordination. In fact, they do not. Tax harmonisation is not the way forward. The Government have been at pains to emphasise that, and we continue to support our veto on taxation. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
broad economic policy guidelines emphasise the need to tackle harmful tax competition. We are in favour of that objective. The code of conduct group, which is chaired by my hon. Friend the Paymaster General, has been examining harmful tax practices, which distort fair tax competition. They also affect the way in which markets work and Governments collect legitimate tax revenue. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman supports that objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We now move on to the general debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of the European Union Document No. 7828/00, the Commission's Recommendation for the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines for 2000; and supports the Government's welcome for this draft as giving operational content to the conclusions of the Lisbon summit, reflecting the importance of structural reform in tackling successfully the challenges of globalisation and competitiveness, and in promoting employment and social inclusion.—[
	<i>Miss Johnson.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>11.34 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding the exiguous nature of my support, I shall seek to divide the Committee after that splendid solo performance—on hearing that, I see that the Liberal Democrat spokesman is leaving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall attempt to explain my reasons for that, during which it will become clear to the Minister why I pursued a certain line of inquiry. I should preface my remarks by saying that her responses were fascinating. This Committee has often proved to be extremely valuable for enabling those of us who are necessarily on the outside of the Whitehall fortress to begin to understand a little of its complex relationship with the Commission's work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by reflecting on the nature of this exceptional document. In her courteous reply, the Minister gave the impression that this was all in the ordinary course of business, that nothing had changed and she did not know who had talked to whom or whether any papers had been exchanged. She said that discussions about such matters take place all the time in an effort to produce a workable and useful product. The image she gave was of business as usual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alas, that is not the situation. If it were, we would have legitimate grounds for complaint about the activities of the Select Committee, which has said that the document is politically important. If the document contains nothing substantive and if, as the Minister said about six times, the document is non-binding—in her view, it is similar to an OECD report—our colleagues on the Select Committee are clearly on hallucinatory drugs. However, I am happy to tell the Committee that our colleagues are not on hallucinatory drugs, because the Minister's premises are false. The document is not in the ordinary course of business. It is not a precedented, ordinary document. It is an unprecedented document which represents a huge leap forward from a certain perspective—or, from my perspective, a huge leap backwards by the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the first time, as the report of our colleagues makes admirably clear, the Commission has taken it on itself to issue recommendations to individual
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0798">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
member states, which the Minister has reminded us repeatedly are non-binding, about how to conduct their economic policies. Indeed, the Commission does that under the heading "General economic policy guidelines".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Committee members, including the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer), who is among the most passionate and articulate defenders of the whole ghastly system that is emerging, know that we must attend carefully to the words used in such documents. I shall not trouble the Committee with the details because I know that you will rule me out of order if I start to use foreign languages, Mrs. Roe, but anyone who looked at the terms used in the other main European languages—I cannot claim to have understood the Greek—for what is described in the document as "guidelines" would find that they carry the same connotation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A guideline is not an OECD commentary. The OECD does not issue guidelines for Britain. If the Commission offered only a commentary, we would be wasting our money. There is no point in establishing a group to offer another independent commentary if the economists involved are inferior in number—if not, perhaps, in quality—to than those at the OECD and have less information. Of course, such a body was not set up. The Select Committee report makes the position admirably clear. With the Government's full approbation, the Lisbon summit established a process by which the Commission could offer guidelines and recommendations for the conduct of economic policy by each member state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Almost as if she had repeated it to herself all last night—and perhaps dreamt about it—so that she could remember to say it today, the Minister said that the document was non-binding. When pressed about how much it had been discussed or negotiated, she said, vaguely, that it had been much discussed and negotiated. She did not deny that it was discussed in COREPER and by our officials with Commission officials, or that Ministers discussed it with Commissioners. Although she was unable or unwilling to give us the details, I suspect that the Treasury, UKREP in COREPER, Ministers and officials have treated the document with the utmost seriousness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document may be non-binding, but it has colossal significance. It is the kernel of the effort to establish clearer and more enforceable economic government of Europe. I am sure that, in a couple of years, the hon. Member for Broxtowe and others of his persuasion and acuity—and the Minister, if she is still the Minister—will tell us that we should have realised by some mysterious process that the document had real force. The Minister will make that claim when some state—perhaps Ireland—has not obeyed the document and discovered to its cost that a non-binding document carried enormous force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will remember the many occasions in the past couple of decades on which we have been given information in the following rhythmical order. First, we are told that a group with no force will be set up and that we should not worry about it, because its recommendations will be non-binding. Then, we are
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
told that those recommendations have some force and that we would have known that if we had examined the original wording carefully enough to discover that the group was important. Finally, we are told that the recommendations have become law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who were Committee members in 1997—some are present today—will surely recall the splendid assertions of the then Financial Secretary, who is now Paymaster General, that her code of conduct group on harmful tax competition had nothing to do with harmonising tax rates. She said that it was simply meant to eliminate the most egregious abuses. Of course, the group that emerged did not match that description. Page 11 makes it explicit that the purpose of that group is to pursue tax co-ordination further. I am sure that if the Paymaster General were here, she would tell us how silly we were to have imagined that a code of conduct group on harmful tax competition—consider the name—could have been expected to produce anything other than a code of conduct that would harmonise tax rules to stop states from competing on tax. She would say that if we had attended to the words, as I did—some did not—we would have known that that would be the outcome.

The same process is taking place here. As one goes to sleep, one must repeat endlessly that the guidelines are non-binding in order to disguise the fact that we are embarking on a process that will, in due course, become binding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall skim over ponderous questions of definition, in which the hon. Gentleman translates tax harmonisation into co-ordination and vice-versa. I have often heard Opposition Members objecting to the rigidities of labour markets and talking about the "sclerotic" economies of some of our European partners. Will the hon. Gentleman explain how EU member states could be encouraged to relax those rigidities, if not by non-binding recommendations from the Commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that the EU has no business drawing up recommendations, guidelines, codes or whatever for the conduct of the economic affairs of its member states, especially those outside the euro. The hon. Gentleman holds an honourable and pellucid view, but it is quite contrary to mine. I have outlined our party's perspective, which is captured in the memorable phrase, "In Europe, but not run by Europe". Not being run by Europe means precisely not having the Commission—or, subsequently, through a qualified majority vote, ECOFIN—setting out guidelines, codes, rules or anything else for the conduct of our economic policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the particular case of the UK, there is nothing objectionable about the recommendations, apart from the absurd emphasis—a hangover from socialist days—in favour of public sector investment, as if that were preferable to private sector investment, but I leave that aside as a mere peccadillo. The substance of the recommendations is unobjectionable, probably because the Government have spent considerable time—the Economic Secretary would not tell us how
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0799">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
much or exactly how it was done—negotiating the proposals so that they almost exactly reflect their position. The Commission was happy to comply: so keen is it to advance its constitutional role—and to be accepted as a body that can make recommendations, draft guidelines and, in due course, draw up rules for the conduct of the economic policy of member states—that it is willing to accept anything in substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notwithstanding the marvellous exegesis from the Economic Secretary about the pensions time bomb, the Commission has nothing to say about it, apart from elusive phrases about taking account of demographic factors. There must be people working in the Commission's economic section who know full well that that is the greatest single problem facing Europe, and they must be well aware of huge rigidities, but these matters were scarcely mentioned so that the Commission could advance further along the road towards acceptance as the proto-economic government of Europe. In our own case, it was willing to accept a text that was in line with UK Government policy and fairly unobjectionable. On fiscal prudence, we and the Government are one. The Chancellor has an admirable record on fiscal prudence: his taxes and expenditure are too high, but the balance is good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ireland is a different matter. I hope that it will become clear to the Economic Secretary why I am concentrating on Ireland—it will provide the first real test. Poor Ireland is just about to find out what happens when all the non-binding rules are broken. The Irish economy is wildly overheated. It has the wrong interest rate because it is part of a currency whose interest rates have been adopted to suit the economies of France, Germany and, to a lesser extent, Italy. That is not Ireland's fault, but a product of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because Ireland has the wrong interest rate and its economy is over-heating, the Commission has made recommendations—in a non-binding guideline—on how Ireland should behave. It advised Ireland
	<br><blockquote><p>to use budgetary policy to ensure economic stability.</p></blockquote>
That is a remarkably tough prescription.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have worked—this is a brief aside—in various third world countries. I once found myself advising the Jamaican Government on negotiations with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF had great power: although it could issue no more than wholly non-binding guidelines, the Jamaican Government would have found it inconvenient if they had paid no attention to those guidelines, because their loans would have disappeared and they had a massive balance of payments crisis. The Jamaican Government therefore paid careful attention to what the IMF had to say. It told them to adjust their fiscal balance slightly, and a considerable row ensued because it was inconvenient for the Jamaican Government to do that as they approached an election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Ireland budgetary measures to calm down the overheating of the economy are also inconvenient because the Irish Government are in the bizarre position of being in surplus. They are being told that
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
they have to run a massive fiscal surplus to make up for the fact that they have the wrong interest rates simply because they belong a currency for which the interest rates are adjusted for someone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us who have our doubts about the wisdom of the economic and monetary union project—not a subject that I am raising at the moment—had prophesied that sort of scenario. What is interesting is that the Commission is beginning to find that the way to solve the interest rate problem is to take control of the fiscal equation. That means not simply maintaining stability through prudent fiscal balances, but forcing members states, in a non-binding way, no doubt—until later—to adjust their tax revenues to make good the economic loss that would otherwise arise from overheating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contents of the document are profound. It is bizarre that a Committee of a few people at an early hour on an ordinary weekday—sitting here, I suspect without the slightest public attention—should be considering a document that is actually the basis of a constitutional and governmental revolution. It is a foundation stone for rule by the Commission over the fiscal balances of member states and the conduct of their economic policy, so as to deal with the problem engendered by the onset of EMU. What is the Government's reaction? Presumably, they welcome the document because they accept that that line of development will be required in the long run if we become part of EMU, as the Government hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are vague about how the whole thing has come about and profess astonishment that anyone should be interested in the process because it is ordinary, commonplace and nothing to get excited about. That genuinely astonishes me. I have no objection to people like the hon. Member for Broxtowe—now, alas, not in his place—having open, clear views in favour of further integration to the point at which there is an economic government of the EU. There is a rational basis for such a view, and it can be defended. I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman, but I understand his view. However, the Government are trying to sleepwalk us into an economic government for Europe, dependent on the Commission, on the grounds that this is a non-binding document, the origins of which are uninteresting. To profess amazement that anyone should be interested in how such a document has come about strikes me as astonishing and very unfortunate for the democratic process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has done a marvellous job in enabling us to get to the bottom of some of document's aims. Now, however, we now have the much more difficult job of making anybody in the United Kingdom aware to the slightest degree of what goes on in Committees such as this one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to comment on the document and happy to note it, as the motion says. I hope that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will take into account some of the speeches
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0800">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
by members of the Committee, not least my own, when she comments on further drafts of the document within the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am astonished by some of the remarks made by the hon. Member for West Dorset. Conservative Governments, led by Baroness Thatcher, signed the Single European Act and drove us to sign the Maastricht treaty without a referendum. However, the Labour Government have put serious and intelligent qualifications on possible future membership of the euro and will submit it to the British people in a referendum. Labour Members are more democratic and reasonable than Conservatives in their approach to the European economy and the way in which it is run. It is possible that the hon. Gentleman did not agree with those decisions taken by previous Governments, but he did not say so in his speech. He did not draw attention to what his colleagues had done in those Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, the document paints a rather unhappy picture of what has been happening in the European Union. The picture is of low growth, high unemployment and falling investment as a proportion of GDP. The graph on page 4 shows that the output of EU countries during the 1960s grew faster than that of the United States of America, but it has fallen substantially and is now well behind that of the USA, even though that country's output has also fallen. Growth in the 1960s was 5 per cent.; it is now about 2 per cent. In that time, unemployment has risen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not unfair to say that a deflationary strategy has been built into the structure and system of Europe. I am not a deflationist: I believe that we should sustain a higher level of demand and a higher level of employment. I am sorry, but I am something of an obsessive about historical economic statistics and history shows that living standards rise fastest when investment is rising, because that permits greater output. At times of full employment, investment rises fastest, because there is a labour shortage and the only way to raise output, and therefore profits, is to invest. At times of high unemployment, investment falls. The diagram on page 7 shows the falling level of investment as a proportion of GDP in the 15 EU countries since 1970. That is not a happy picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the dependency ratio. A higher proportion of people who are not productive, particularly the elderly, depend on a smaller number of people being productive in the economy. That has partly to do with official unemployment rates—the comparable measure used by the OECD, EU and others for all the nations of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, a much wider measure of unemployment is provided by those who are economically inactive. There are many people who might not figure in the unemployment statistics, but who would be employed if they had the opportunity to work. It is a question of not only providing a nice supply side environment, but generating sufficient demand to create more jobs, raise the level of employment and give people opportunities to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
About 1 million men over 50 in Britain would work, if jobs were available. However, many people call themselves "early retirees" or another euphemism for being unemployed. Their incomes are not high and they form part of the dependent group in our society. The position is worse on the continent. Our economy is doing much better than that of the EU, but we need to generate more jobs and employment, so that the dependency ratio automatically goes down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many years ago, I taught in further education. One course I taught, as a fill-in, was about preparation for retirement. I met many local people who were approaching retirement, some of whom clearly wanted to retire. Most of them had hard physical jobs, did not earn much and wanted a rest. However, many other people, including, for example, women aged about 60 who were still competent and fully able to do a good job, were desperately keen not to retire. If people want to continue to work beyond the age of 60 and earn a proper living, there is nothing wrong with that. The problem is that there are not enough jobs, which means that employers pick and choose. Sadly, they tend to pick younger rather than experienced, middle-aged people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speaking as a 58-year-old, I am much more competent now, and would be a much more useful employee, than I was when I was aged 18 or 28. However, if I put myself on the job market again—I hope that the voters will not do that to me just yet—I suspect that I would be less interesting to an employer than someone who was 18 or 28. Millions of citizens in the European Union would work if the jobs existed, perhaps even for a not terribly high wage, but cannot do so because there are not enough jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dependency ratio is part of what I call deflationist Europe. A feature of sclerotic Europe is its low growth and high unemployment. If we could raise the level of growth, generate a bit more demand and get people back into work, many problems would be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We—Britain in particular and Europe in general—are still surviving on what I call the golden legacy, that is, the post-war legacy of full employment and rapid growth. During that period, between 1945 and approximately 1970, Europe built up its strength. Since then, we have had lower growth, higher unemployment and a faltering economy. I draw the attention of Committee members to the right-hand side of the lower column of the diagram on page 4 of the document, which suggests that GDP per working hour per capita faltered during the 1990s—we have not discussed that period in much detail—and declined in one case. Performance was rather worse during the 1990s than it was during previous decades, which is worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my comments do not fit in with current economic policy or conventional wisdom. I must say, as a modest economist, that, sadly, economics is dominated much more by fashion—perhaps prejudice is a better word—than by reason. Economists treat their convictions virtually as religious beliefs. I have seen economists on television lose an argument and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0801">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
burst out with their prejudice. Economics is at the same stage as medicine was during the mediaeval period—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman mentioned the graph on page 4 only in passing—I had not concentrated on it previously—but has he noticed that its principal conclusion, which arises from the discrepancy between GDP per person employed and GDP per working hour, is that Europeans since about 1970 have decided to work significantly less?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I do not think that people decided to work significantly less; it is that jobs are not available for them. That productivity trend, which is illustrated in the diagram, suggests that a secular trend continues year on year, whatever the state of the economy. If one wants to secure faster economic growth and productivity, one has to have higher levels of investment. That happens only if one increases demand and induces shortages in the factors of production, especially labour, which in turn induces producers to invest more, therefore to produce more with the same amount of labour. That has not happened in Europe. We are going in the wrong direction, although I hope that we can turn this ship around and return to the highly sensible policies that we had during the immediate post-war era.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Gentleman is saying about the late 1990s, but the trend since around 1980 does not suggest that. Labour productivity and GDP per working hour worked has risen substantially from around 85 per cent. to 95 per cent. It is the GDP per person employed that has hardly risen during the same period and the only explanation of those two simultaneous phenomena is that people in Europe are working fewer hours. People are employed, but they are working less.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Gentleman says, but I shall have to discuss it with him later. GDP per working hour has risen at a faster rate than GDP per capita, which means that there has been unemployment. That is my simple point. I would have to consider the matter in more detail to respond fully to the hon. Gentleman. Only when output per person rises to the level of productivity per working hour will unemployment fall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that in the European Union working hours have fallen, holidays have increased and so on. Sweden's economy has been very successful recently and it is considering giving an extra week's holiday to make a statutory six weeks a year for everyone. Yet, living standards and growth are high and the economy is doing well. Two of the economies that are doing best within the European Union at the moment—notably that of Sweden and our own, which is doing better than in the past in terms of employment—are outside the euro zone. Countries in the euro zone are doing rather worse. The tensions of the euro arrangement in which one interest rate fits all are showing. The hon. Member for West Dorset referred to Ireland. If a country starts
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
by having to reduce interest rates substantially without changing anything else, that will be refiationary initially and inflationary eventually. Our Government are wise in their present stance to adapt policies to the needs of our economy, which is why we are doing relatively well, although there is much more to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sweden is a better example because its economy is doing extremely well. I am a member of the all-party Swedish group and recently met the Swedish ambassador. I asked him why, when the Swedish economy is doing so well, there is an establishment view to join the euro, which might reduce its growth rate and raise unemployment, and what the advantages would be, but he did not really have an answer. Britain's position is sensible. The five economic tests and a referendum will bring a sensible resolution to this long-running debate.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: So I shall not miss a nail-biting vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the opinion of the hon. Member for West Dorset on a dull report, but his concern had a slightly sinister element. The European Commission often runs ahead of its mandate and sets all sorts of hares running. This is a fairly innocent case. Much of the pressure for broader economic reporting issued from the British Government. At the Lisbon summit, it was the Prime Minister's anxiety about the European Union starting to consider the problems involved in labour markets and innovation that led to that broader analysis. The Commission has merely responded—not all that well—to a mandate that was set for it by heads of Government, of whom our own Prime Minister was very much in the lead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman about that. My point is that our Government is part of the plot—the Commission is merely responding heroically to their agenda. Using economic reporting as a way of achieving constitutional development is just like using single or open markets to achieve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I see the plot unfolding in quite the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests, partly because of his belief that a sinister element is involvedin the policy prescriptions for Ireland. It was understood from the outset that once countries became part of the monetary union, they would have to use policy instruments other than interest rates. That is why the original discussion of monetary union, to which the previous Government were very much party through the Maastricht treaty—although they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0802">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
secured an opt-out—incorporated both fiscal and monetary policy. That was what the stability pact was all about, and it is still very much present in the background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even in a common monetary area, alternative policy instruments must be available. That applies to the United Kingdom. For example, especially in respect of labour and property markets, the economy is overheated in south-west London and depressed in north-east London. The same is true of the United States. Any common monetary area has to have other policy prescriptions. The recommendations for Ireland are entirely proper, sensible and economically literate, and I find it hard to understand why they should be viewed as surprising or threatening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman. EMU indeed requires such medicine and I do not find it surprising that we are seeing the genesis of the Commission and ECOFIN telling countries how to run their fiscal affairs. That is exactly the consequence that we predicted. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the Liberal Democrats have always recognised that a consequence of economic and monetary union is the gradual transfer of power over the fiscal balance to the European authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making jumps in his argument when he refers to the Commission "telling" countries how to run their fiscal affairs. We have always argued, as have the Government, that there is no reason why it is not possible for countries to be part of a successful economic and monetary union while having fiscal autonomy. However, it is clearly necessary for Governments to use tax policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see nothing harmful whatever in international organisations offering considered advice. The Bank for International Settlements, the OECD and the IMF continually do so. With regard to the IMF, very few countries are in Jamaica's position, but we still have to take seriously what it says. That is peer group pressure. There is nothing wrong or sinister about that, and it does not represent a loss of sovereignty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's comments suggest that instead of taking a global, European or national approach to economic management, there is a case for going to the regional or local level and being specifically interventionist to overcome some of the problems that he has mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman. I interpreted the report rather in that spirit of suggesting the policies should operate at different levels in different ways—for example, a common monetary policy in the euro area, national fiscal policies, which act within a voluntary framework, and interventionist policies at a local level, stimulating regional developments to deal with problems of regional unemployment. That multi-level approach makes perfect economic sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The growth and stability pact, and some of the policies in the document, imply movement towards a universal policy on taxation and on fiscal
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
policy in general, including on spending and even pensions. There could be an attempt to bring down Italian, German and French pension levels and perhaps, even, to raise ours. Who knows? Some of those measures are an attempt to even up policies in every sphere across Europe and, I suppose, eventually, the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will simply repeat that I do not think that the framework of the European monetary union is incompatible with individual countries having their own independent taxing and spending policies. It is not incompatible with the stability pact either. That broadly sets the macro-economic objectives that countries are supposed to achieve in respect of their deficits and surpluses. It says nothing about how Governments are to raise taxes or how they are to spend their money. That leap that the Conservatives often make has little substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of merely responding to interventions, let me try to be positive about where this broader approach of Community reporting is helpful and positive. First, it recognises for the first time that growth is important. We are not just talking about macro-economic policy. It is now recognised that one of the main influences on the euro-dollar rate, which has been the dominant debating theme since the EMU started, is the market's appreciation of different rates of growth, and not simply different rates of inflation. It is important to focus on growth issues, if the EMU project is to succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the report is positive in recognising that the EMU process works. It is not only a matter of prudent macro-economic policies and fiscal policies. It is also necessary to have effective adjustment through the capital markets and through the labour markets. That is happening to a surprising degree. Much of the enormous boom that has taken place in the Eurobond market is financing the vast amount of corporate restructuring that has taken place in the wake of the single market and, latterly, the launch of euro-land. This is a positive trend and it seems entirely appropriate that there should be some mechanism within the European Commission for observing its progress—in other words, looking at the factors determining growth and effective adjustment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report is not especially interesting or well written, but between the lines it contains some useful material. It makes one quite courageous point, when it sets out in quite brutal language an acknowledgement of some past policy failures. That is always a good start. It recognises, in its tables and text, that European performance has been seriously defective compared with that of the United States, especially over the past 10 years. Even those of us who are broadly in favour of closer European integration accept that there have been failures in Europe. There is no point in glossing over that. It is very useful that the Commission sets out with brutal clarity a frank and open acknowledgment of past policy failures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other advance is that countries are being encouraged to sign up. It is voluntary; there is no hidden plot involved. Governments are being encouraged to sign up for policies that are difficult
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0803">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
domestically, but which are none the less important. The report uses some rather tortured Euro-speak in referring to labour markets, but everyone knows that it means greater flexibility in the sense that we understand it in this country. It is an important advance that all the countries in the zone are now committed to that in writing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman keep referring to this as a report, when it clearly states that it is a recommendation for guidelines which are going to be adopted by a qualified majority vote by ECOFIN? Is it not more than a report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is reading a little more into that than is perhaps merited. We are discussing policy guidelines which the spirit of the original Lisbon summit embraced. We have already batted this argument back and forth several times. There is a difference between a set of guidelines voluntarily adopted by Governments and mandatory instructions issued by a supranational body. There is an enormous gulf between those two and we are nowhere near to crossing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final comment relates to that. The extent to which we have crossed that big gulf depends not on what has been said in this paper, but on what is happening within the European committee which deals with the economic co-ordination mechanism of the European Union. We are, unfortunately, excluded from that body. The hon. Gentleman is validly concerned about the decisions that are taken in that group—the Finance Ministers' group. It is becoming an important policy-making forum, but we do not know what it is doing. One of the reasons for that is that we have chosen to opt out of the first wave of economic and monetary union, so the Chancellor is asked to leave the room when the committee deliberates. That is a serious matter. The committee's discussions may be rather anodyne at this stage of its development and it may not have the enormous implications that the Conservatives would have us believe. None the less, it has the potential to advance the economic agenda substantially, and we are concerned about the way in which the EMU entry process has been handled, because we have been sidelined from the one significant, economic policy-formulating group within the euro zone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was rather concerned when I read that, because the document takes a hard look at past policy failures in the various countries. The United Kingdom does not lack a coherent strategy for transport.

I was interested by what the hon. Member for West Dorset said. His sense of the profundity of the document is not shared by his party colleagues, who are absent—to a man, rather than to a person. The hon. Gentleman is on his own. He has misinterpreted the status of the document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason why my hon. Friends are absent is that the pressure of work in the House means that, unfortunately, European Standing Committee A sometimes sits at the same time as ESC B. The other Committee has something even more devastating to consider, which is why they are there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Government Members present have equal demands or attractions on their time. The hon. Gentleman is trying to cover up the fact that there are no Opposition Members here to support his fairly outrageous attempts to shroud-wave, by taking these non-binding guidelines and dressing them up as something that they are not. I am grateful to a number of Committee members, including the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), who acknowledged the actual status of the draft guidelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidelines were discussed by finance Ministers at two meetings of the ECOFIN council, one of which I attended. Detailed drafting changes have been made along the way and I draw the attention of the hon. Member for West Dorset to the explanatory memorandum, which points out that—to state the obvious—the Chancellor is responsible for economic policy,
	<br><blockquote><p>including the formulation of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines by the Council.</p></blockquote>
The guidelines, which have been discussed with member states, are non-binding and their general thrust is entirely consistent with the UK's stated policy objectives. The hon. Gentleman suggested that this is the first time that there have been country-specific guidelines. That was perhaps an oversight, because such guidelines were in fact drawn up for the first time last year.

I was fascinated by the hon. Gentleman's attack on virtually any codes and instruments emanating from extra-national borders. Perhaps he would like to renounce our membership of the IMF and G7 or any other forum in which we are a player, because he seemed to suggest that we should not participate in any such bodies beyond the boundaries of the UK. However, it is hard to accept that his party believes that, even allowing for its current stance on such matters.

The hon. Gentleman seems not to have read the broad economic policy guidelines carefully in respect of Ireland. They state not that the Irish Government must tighten their fiscal policy, but that they must be ready to use fiscal policy to ensure economic stability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still pursuing the previous point. If the Economic Secretary is right to say that it is not the first time that country-specific guidelines have been drawn up, I confess to a grave oversight. However, when she says that there is nothing to be concluded from the Commission's statement that Ireland should be ready to use fiscal policy to ensure economic stability, I wonder whether her biblical exegesis has reached its limits. Why would the Commission say that Ireland should be ready to do that if it did not want Ireland subsequently to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The guidelines state not that the Irish Government should use and tighten fiscal policy, but that they should be prepared to consider doing so. The hon. Gentleman referred to my explanation as biblical exegesis, but nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, it was he who nit-picked over words and tried to find something that was not there. He derided the idea that the public sector was preferable to the private sector, and the Conservative party has attacked the Government's efforts to put massive sums of extra money into the health service and our public services. I take that as a further indication that he believes that privatisation is the way forward for public services such as the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has also failed to take account of the fact that we have invested widely in public services, while cutting public sector net borrowing by £44 billion between 1996 and 1997, as a result of our prudent management of the economy. We have, therefore, been able to satisfy the Maastricht deficit and debt criteria. Indeed, the figures are well within the forecast presented in our last convergence programme. That is the result of our continuing commitment to stability and prudence. Budget 2000, the most recent Budget, locks in fiscal tightening over the next two years to a greater extent than was projected in Budget 1999 and ensures that the Government remain firmly on track to meet their tough fiscal rules over the economic cycle and, through our prudent management of the economy, to put much extra investment into public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public service and net investment will more than double to 1.8 per cent. of GDP by 2003-04. That will make a significant further contribution to tackling the legacy of underfunding of Britain's public
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
infrastructure, while enabling us to remain consistent with our sustainable investment rule. Therefore, there have been many achievements in those respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Twickenham, who said earlier that he had to leave and is no longer with us, asked about the Euro XI. Perhaps I may again remove a shroud that he was waving. We have always known that those who are part of the Euro XI will want to meet from time to time to discuss the issues relating to a common currency. Indeed, the Luxembourg European Council agreed to that. We have no problems with that. We are keen to see the Euro XI group operating smoothly and successfully, but we must be clear about the framework agreed by all member states in which it will do so. The Ministers of all member states will discuss matters of common interest and the ECOFIN Council, of which we are a member, in accordance with the procedures determined by the treaty, will in all cases, take decisions. The Luxembourg Council made it clear that the group would discuss only issues connected with shared specific responsibilities for the single currency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths) made some remarks on transport. As she rightly says, transport is mentioned in the "Broad Economic Policy Guidelines" and the Commission's view that the United Kingdom should
	<br><blockquote><p>develop a coherent transport strategy to tackle the problems of road congestion, inadequate investment in the railways and poor service quality in public transport.</p></blockquote>
That is the legacy of neglect and poor investment that we inherited from the previous Government. We have taken a number of steps towards such a strategy, which I am sure my hon. Friend is aware of, such as the integrated transport White Paper, which was published in 1998, the Transport Bill that is going through the House and the 10-year transport strategy, which will be published this summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The long-term and prudent management of the economy that will enable us to fulfil our commitment to sustained investment will focus on coherent and reliable improvements to the transport network. Some improvements have already been seen: there has been a 17 per cent. increase in rail journeys since May 1997, with 1,300 more trains daily to meet that demand; over 15,000 new buses have been put on the roads in the last two years; and nine new bypasses have been opened, with road maintenance up by 20 per cent. Those improvements show that the Government have begun to implement various key aspects of a coherent transport strategy and to make the necessary investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North has a wide interest in this subject. He will perhaps forgive me if I do not respond to all his remarks. I should tell him that the chart on the right-hand side of page 4 of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0805">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
the document does not show that EU GDP per capita is falling; it is relative to us. My hon. Friend may not have realised that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I said that it was relative to the American performance. I appreciate that it is a relative performance, but it illustrates the divergence between GDP per person employed and GDP per capita in relative terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The chart is indeed relative to the United States, so the slight decline in GDP per capita that it shows is relative to the United States, but I reassure my hon. Friend that in absolute terms GDP per capita is still increasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The action that the Government have taken to improve the macro-economic framework, which already delivers the greater stability to which I have referred, will allow sustained increases in output and output growth and in living standards. The introduction of the golden rule has created a clear distinction between current and capital expenditure to ensure that worthwhile capital investment is not squeezed out by short-term pressures, as it has been in the past. We inherited a severely underfunded public infrastructure. Our aim is to correct that serious deficit by more than doubling investment by 2003-04. That increased investment is a prerequisite of higher growth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Dorset tried to insist that monetary union means tax harmonisation. That is nonsense. Tax policy will remain the responsibility of member states. The United Kingdom has a veto and has every intention of maintaining it. We cannot compare ourselves with the United States, which has a single currency but has no harmonisation of sales, corporation or income tax rates, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman is aware. There is no question of the UK giving up its ability to make decisions on tax and spending, which will remain matters for the Budget and for UK spending reviews. I invite the hon. Gentleman to lay down that shroud, which I am sure he has waved at us before now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me put the Government's record to the Committee. Our finances are now on a sound footing; we have cut borrowing by £44 billion over our first three years; we have increased employment by some 920,000 since the general election and unemployment is at its lowest level for 20 years and continuing to fall; exports are up 13 per cent. on the year and by more than 10 per cent. to the EU. We have done much to help people to get into work: more than 750,000 people already participate in the new deal and associated programmes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Economic Secretary finishes her recitation, will she tell the Committee why they are called guidelines?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Guidelines are so called because their purpose is to guide people. I remind the hon. Gentleman that his party has failed to support the new deal and would end it, which would affect the 77 per cent. fall in youth unemployment in his constituency of West Dorset. All our constituents who have seen youth unemployment fall throughout the country would be affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting the Economic Secretary's splendid recitation, but does she believe that schools, for example, are generally disinclined to pay attention to the guidance provided by the Department for Education and Employment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are here to discuss not guidance to schools but the broad economic policy guidelines, and I am not an Education Minister, as the hon. Gentleman is well aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the other measures that we have put in place in accordance with broad economic policy guidelines includes help for working families with the working families tax credit, which has been increased by a further £4.35, and the children's tax credit, which will be topped up to £442 a year, which is more than double the value of the married couple's allowance that it replaced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise again for interrupting the Economic Secretary's marvellous party political broadcast. Will she tell us whether she pays attention to the guidance for Ministers on their conduct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this is an attempt to draw a parallel between the guidance to Ministers and the broad economic policy guidelines, it is a false attempt. The hon. Gentleman knows that all my ministerial colleagues and I pay serious attention to that guidance. There is no parallel whatever between the guidance and the guidelines that we are discussing. If the hon. Gentleman wants to split hairs, I can split them even better than he can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final text of the broad economic policy guidelines will be adopted by ECOFIN at the forthcoming European Council in Feira. If we approve the motion, the United Kingdom will be able to play a positive role in promoting the economic reform agenda throughout Europe to bring employment and growth to Britain and other member states. I urge the Committee to support the motion and to accept the draft guidelines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of the European Union Document No. 7828/00, the Commission's Recommendation for the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines for 2000; and supports the Government's welcome for this draft as giving operational content to the conclusions of the Lisbon summit, reflecting the importance of structural reform in tackling successfully the challenges of globalisation and competitiveness, and in promoting employment and social inclusion.</p></blockquote></p>
