	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>Draft Representation of the People (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2002</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>9.55 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Yvette Cooper)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Representation of the People (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2002.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Representation of the People (England and Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2002.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two sets of regulations are similar, save for some differences that reflect differing electoral provisions and institutions in Scotland. Their effect is the same, however. Similar regulations have been laid relating to Northern Ireland, but a separate Committee is considering them as they differ in some points of detail. I shall refer primarily to the England and Wales regulations, and then mention any important differences in the Scottish regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are necessary to implement section 9 of the Representation of the People Act 2000. Hon. Members will be aware that that provides for two versions of the electoral registers to be compiled. One is a full register that contains, as now, the names and addresses of every elector, and the other is an edited version to contain the details of only those electors who have not suggested via an opt-out box on the registration form that they object to their details appearing on the version of the register that is available for commercial purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I describe some of the provisions in detail, I want to set out the context and background. As hon. Members may know, we originally intended to introduce the regulations this time last year, but the general election left insufficient time in the parliamentary timetable. We have used the time since then to consult further with users of the registers, both commercial and in government, and with law enforcement interests and the public in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, however, a case heard in the High Court in November found that electoral registration officers, in selling the registers to commercial concerns, as they were required to do by the existing regulations, were acting in breach of the European data protection directive. As a result, all commercial sales of the electoral registers had to cease until such time as the wishes of individual electors could be ascertained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations reflect the result of wide consultation, and the need to comply with human rights and data protection legislation. They make it clear that there will be two registers, and that the complete register will not be available for marketing companies or all and sundry who want to use it for any commercial purpose. Such organisations will be able to purchase an edited register that people will give
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
their consent to be part of. The regulations permit access to the registers for specified purposes, including certain specific commercial purposes when we believe they are in a strong public interest. I shall talk about the detail of that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations 1 and 2 provide for the commencement, interpretation and extent of the regulations for England and Wales and for Scotland. Apart from the regulations that deal with access to the registers, they will take effect as from the annual canvass of electors for 15 October 2002. In England and Wales, the provisions that deal with access to the registers will come into force on 16 October 2002, or, if a register is not published on that day, on the day after the register has been published. In any event, the register has to be published by no later than 1 December 2002, and the regulations will be fully in force by then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland, as a result of consultation with registration officers about the annual canvass and publication of the revised register, the position is different. Instead of the provisions coming into force on 16 October 2002, they will come into force on 18 November. That is the earliest date by which the Scottish registration officers thought that the revised registers would be available for publication. In any event, all registers must be published—in Scotland also—by no later than 1 December, and the comparable Scottish regulations will also be fully in force by then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations 3 to 5 and 7, and regulation 11 in Scotland, make a number of minor amendments to the previous regulations. Regulation 8 provides that any applicant for registration other than at the annual canvass must be made aware of the right to have his name omitted from an edited register and of the effect of doing so and given 21 days in which to respond with his choice. It incorporates the forms set out in the schedule to the regulations. The form prescribed for the annual canvass of households is at part 1 of the Schedule. Part 2 provides the form of words that is included in the canvass form, which must be issued to a person who applies for registration other than on a form provided by the electoral registration officer. Similar provision for Scotland is made at regulation 7 and the schedule to the Scotland regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations 6 and 9 to 11 make provision for the public inspection and limited copying by hand-written notes of the full register. Regulation 15 introduces the main changes by inserting part 6, "Supply of Register Etc", into the principal regulations. New regulations 92 to 94 place general restrictions on the sale of and access to the full registers and on the use that recipients of the register may make of the data.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Juries Act 1974 already requires a copy of each of the English and Welsh registers to be sent to the Lord Chancellor for the summoning of juries in England and Wales and new regulation 95 prevents such copies from being used for any other purpose or for information to be disclosed. The provisions enabling the Scottish Courts Service to summon jurors in Scotland are contained in regulation 112 of the Scotland Regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
New regulations 96 to 101 require the registration officer to supply free of charge and on publication a copy of the full register to the British Library, as the national library of record, and the National Library of Scotland in the case of the Scotland Regulations; the Office for National Statistics for statistical purposes; and the Electoral and Boundary Commissions in connection with their statutory duties in checking the admissibility of donations to political parties and in reviewing electoral boundaries. They restrict the use of such copies to the purposes for which they were supplied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New regulation 102 sets out the general provisions on the supply of the full register under regulations 103 to 109. Persons or organisations falling within those regulations may request a copy of the full version of the register, any notices amending the register and the list of overseas electors, free of charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New regulation 103 provides for the supply of the full register to MPs, MEPs, Members of the National Assembly for Wales, local councillors, the Mayor of London and London Assembly members, and elected mayors, who may receive free of charge the parts of the register covering the areas that they represent and can use the information for all electoral purposes and for any purpose connected with their office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Parliamentary Secretary explain what the phrase "electoral purposes" means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try to set out some of the issues that the phrase will cover. It is relatively broad in order to include what most people understand to be electoral purposes in terms of the normal work of canvassing by political parties and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I should like to deal with what already-elected representatives can do in the course of their duties, which is a separate issue from electoral purposes, canvassing and so on. I shall come to those matters and will be happy to take a further intervention from the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) in a moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Field (Cities of London and Westminster)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary made reference to Greater London Authority members being able to have access to the register. As a result of the elections for the GLA—this applies also to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly—there are several top-up Members. Will top-up Members have greater rights than first-past-the-post elected Members? The logic is that a top-up Member in Greater London will be entitled to the entirety of the London register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is very warm, so any hon. Member who wishes to remove their jackets have the permission of the Chair to do so; although some have already done so without the Chair's permission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, hon. Members will have access to that section of the electoral role that is relevant to their duties. I shall clarify later exactly how that will affect top-up Members, but I believe that they would have access to anything relevant to those whom they represent. For example, if an hon. Member
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
wanted to contact a constituent or a group of constituents about a local or national matter, he would be able to refer to the register to ascertain someone's address. He may also pass the register to his research assistant to assist with constituency matters. The registers should continue to be used as a tool in the work that representatives are elected to carry out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Reid 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary listed the elected office holders who are entitled to copies of the register, but the Scottish regulations make no reference to Members of the Scottish Parliament. It seems that every councillor in Scotland can use the register, but not MSPs. Surely, that is a grave omission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. The appropriate legislative vehicle to apply the provisions to MSPs and to Scottish parliamentary elections is an order made under section 12 of the Scotland Act 1998. Scotland Office officials are drafting a new order that will include those provisions, which we expect to be presented early in the next parliamentary Session.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 12 of the Scotland Act simply gives the power to make provision about elections. Elected Members of this House and councillors are allowed to have copies of the registers by virtue of their office. The Minister referred to situations when Members would want to do that, but the power in the Scotland Act is a power only to make regulations about elections, and has nothing to do with what MSPs can do by virtue of their office between elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The advice that I have been given is that the measure to which I referred is the right vehicle for setting out access for MSPs in that area. There is no difference in principle. Everyone accepts that MSPs should have access to the electoral role, like other elected representatives, in order to be able to fulfil their duties. It is a point of legal drafting, given the legislative framework that we have to deal with, that it needs to be done with a separate order under section 12 of the Scotland Act. The principle is exactly the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New regulation 108 provides for the supply of the full register to candidates at parliamentary, European parliamentary or local government elections for electoral purposes, which answers the point raised by the hon. Member for Stone. That allows candidates to know precisely who the electors are so that they can carry out their canvassing in the traditional way. Provision for copies of the full register for electoral purposes or to holders of elected offices in terms of the Scottish Parliament are not made under these regulations. They will be provided for in a new order to be made under section 12 of the Scotland Act later in the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New regulation 104 similarly allows all MPs, MEPs, members of the devolved Parliament and Assemblies, local councillors and so on also to have free copies of all the full registers to enable them to comply with the statutory controls on political donations contained in schedule 7 to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
schedule 2A to the Representation of the People Act 1983.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether fundraising by political parties and elected representatives will be deemed to be included in the definition of "electoral purposes". One of our concerns is that the Electoral Commission or the courts might turn out to be somewhat legalistic about the question. The admitted vagueness in terms of the lack of definition is something on which we need some clear indicators, because it could be extremely important in relation to the activities not just of the Conservative party but of the Labour party and, indeed, of any other party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would expect "electoral purposes" to be interpreted broadly to cover everything connected with the electoral process. That would include allowing political parties and organisations to use the full registers for canvassing or any other activities connected with the electoral process. It would not be permitted, however, to pass on the register to charities for use in fundraising, as may have been done previously</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary defines the phrase "electoral purposes" by reference to canvassing and then says that there would be a restriction on charities using the register for fundraising. However, she has not told us the answer to my question, on which she might like to take advice because we must get it straight. I am concerned that the words "electoral purposes" should not be construed as preventing the register from being used for the purposes of fundraising by political parties for general elections and other elections, including a referendum or whatever else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that we might come to the subject of referendums sooner or later. I shall seek clarification on that matter before I wind up because I do not want to give an answer that would make difficult the important electoral work that should be done in a democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heath 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Somerton and Frome)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary would do well to try to define "electoral purposes", as well as the purposes of the democratic process, because it is a potential minefield in terms of interpretation. Use of the register to communicate with voters between election periods by those who are not yet elected is a case in point. Similarly, there may be a problem in the case of a hybrid publication, which has some electoral purpose but other purposes, too. How such cases are interpreted by the Electoral Commission could be of considerable importance to the day-to-day work of political parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why it would be unwise for us to pin down in the regulations what "electoral purposes" means. Given that the way in which we communicate with voters is changing over time, it would be a mistake to set out a restrictive list in statute, which might make the legitimate purpose of communicating with voters about electoral issues difficult. I shall take further interventions, although I
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
am aware that I have not entirely answered the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very nice to the Minister because she is going to save my Crown court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will she clarify whether the register will be available to all political parties? If so, it would be available to a minority party, such as the British National Party, who could discover from it who lives in Oldham, in spite of the fact that some people in Oldham may not want the BNP to have their names and addresses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honest truth is that the electoral roll will be available to anyone engaged in the electoral process who wants to use the register for electoral purposes. That is the nature of the democracy in which we live; we must win the arguments against the BNP, as I believe we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point on the BNP, it strikes me that those people who do not wish their names to appear on the register may be able to take advantage of regulation 8 to ensure that their details appear only on the edited version. Would there be an opportunity for people in especially sensitive areas to ensure that they were not on the register, so that they need not be subject to hate mail or exposed to the issues raised by the BNP? When I was canvassing before the last general election, I found that, even in my constituency, many people had chosen not to be on the electoral register. There is an ongoing concern about the issue of civil liberties. I do not suggest that we should follow the American model, but many people do not want to be on the register because they do not want to be inundated with all sorts of literature from political parties and commercial organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honest truth is that we are striking a balance between different rights and interests. On one hand, people want privacy and to be free from direct marketing. On the other hand, one of the rights under the human rights convention is the right to participate in free and fair elections, which means that candidates must have adequate opportunity to communicate their views to the electorate, and not only in the last few weeks in the run-up to an election. The possibility must exist for continuous communication for electoral purposes. It is a fundamental issue in support of democracy that candidates from political parties should be able to communicate with those who are registered to vote on issues around the election. That is what the electoral roll is for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to pursue the matter, but I still have not received the answer to my question whether "electoral purposes" specifically includes fundraising. One should bear in mind that under the legislation in question, a requirement exists to consult the Electoral Commission before making the regulations.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the hon. Gentleman's point. As I said to him, I would like to receive complete clarification on the matter before answering his question in my summing up. I have had advice on

the fundraising issue but, as it is so important, I do not want to say something on the record that might be misinterpreted or inaccurate. I shall respond in full when summing up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New regulation 106 provides for the supply of the full register to political parties. Uses are restricted to electoral purposes and comply with controls on donations under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. A permitted participant within the meaning of section 105(1) of the Act may also use it for purposes in connection with the campaign in respect of the referendum and the purposes of complying with controls on donations in schedule 15 to the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New regulation 107 provides for the supply of the full register to the council that appointed the registration officer. The council may use the information contained in the full register only for the discharge of a statutory function relating to security, law enforcement or crime prevention, or for statistical purposes, in which case no information shall be disclosed that includes the name and address of any elector. The related regulation 106 in Scotland differs slightly in respect of the purpose to which a community council may use the full register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New regulation 109 provides for the supply of the full register to police forces, crime squads and so on. The information on the register can be used only for the purpose of prevention and detection of crime and the enforcement of the criminal law in England and Wales, Scotland or elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New regulations 110 and 111 set out the fees for selling copies of the full or edited versions of the registers in data or printed format. The full register may be sold to persons only as authorised by the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New regulation 113 provides for the sale of the full register to Government Departments and restricts its use to the prevention and detection of crime and the enforcement of the criminal law; the vetting of employees and applicants for employment, where such vetting is required pursuant to any legislation; and the supply and disclosure of information to an authorised person who may not disclose information contained in it except to other authorised persons, and only for use for the purposes for which such a person could obtain the full register directly under the regulations. The related regulation 112 in Scotland extends the use of the register to include "the administration of justice". That will enable the Scottish Courts Service to continue to purchase the full register for the selection of jurors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next section of the regulations that I want to talk about specifies what limited commercial use is to be permitted of the full registers. Many commercial companies have used information from the electoral registers for many years and for a variety of purposes, including direct marketing and credit reference checks. The court case to which I referred made it clear that electoral registration officers had been wrong to sell the registers for those purposes, without first giving electors the right to opt out of having their personal details sold in that way. The Government have
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
carefully considered the situation and conducted lengthy discussions with bodies that represent commercial interests, including the British Bankers Association, the Finance and Leasing Association, the Direct Marketing Association and numerous others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Banks and financial institutions have a statutory obligation under the money laundering regulations to verify the identity of their clients. The regulations do not specify in detail how identity is to be verified. In complying with those regulations, banks and financial institutions make extensive use of the electoral register to verify information about the identity and address of their customers, as it is the most complete publicly available database. They usually carry out the checks using credit reference agencies as their agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If institutions were denied access to the full register to make those checks and had to rely on lower quality information, there would be less compliance with the money laundering regulations. Therefore, there are clear public benefits in the use of the electoral roll in relation to those regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Osborne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Finance and Leasing Association has pointed out to us that the regulations allow access to the full register for only quite limited matters, such as the application for credit and the enforcement of the money laundering regulations. However, it has said that not all financial crime prevention activity falls within the categories, unfortunately, so use of the electoral roll information for fraud protection and other financial crises will be curtailed. We clearly would not want to see that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honest truth is that a difficult balance has to be struck. We want to define matters on which there is clear public interest in the continuing use of the electoral register, and to recognise the legitimate desire for privacy on the part of people who have not consented to be included on the edited electoral register. We must consider the uses to which the full electoral register can legitimately be put. There are no simple answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Goodman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wycombe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Parliamentary Secretary received representations from the Consumer Credit Trade Association on the precise point of public interest that she raised? It argues that if a fraud or financial crime occurs, the initial investigations are most frequently made by the bank, building society or finance house involved because the police do not have the resources. By preventing access to the full electoral register, inquires by such bodies may be delayed, hampered or aborted. What is her response to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A series of representations has been made on both sides of the regulations. At the same time as some have argued for wider access to different financial organisations, others have argued for less access than the regulations set out on the basis of privacy and consent issues. The territory is difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Pete Wishart 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Parliamentary Secretary have any concerns about wider access to the electoral register being a major disincentive for people to register with it? We face great apathy about politics and politicians, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
increased use of the register by credit card companies may be a further disincentive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the other issues that must be weighed in the balance. We should be honest with ourselves that this is a balancing act. We must ensure that there is no disincentive for people to register and that their right to vote is not in any way conditional on other concerns. There will not always be a consensus on this issue among the organisations that have a stake in it. The matter was consulted on quite extensively and the question of where the balance should be struck was reflected upon considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is about recognising individuals' human rights. The right to a private life and the right to participate in free and fair elections are considerations. Those rights under the convention are qualified, and can be interfered with in the pursuit of a legitimate objective of the state, but the extent and nature of any such interference must be proportionate to the importance of and benefits to be obtained from the interference. In the end, that is what this debate is about; under what circumstances it is proportionate to allow the further use of the full and unedited electoral roll. It is right to consider money laundering and credit reference issues, which relate to points raised by hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In striking that balance, the Government have introduced regulations that permit the sale of the full register to credit reference agencies, first, to enable financial institutions to meet their statutory obligations to prevent money laundering, and secondly, to enable credit checks to be undertaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To tackle money laundering, the credit reference agencies will be permitted to provide information, from a full register that they have obtained, to banks and financial institutions so that those bodies can meet their statutory obligations. It is clear that the strong public interest in enforcing the laws against money laundering and the relatively limited purposes for which access is permitted, results in the balance favouring access for those purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second category of cases where the Government have concluded that there should be continued access to the full register is for credit reference agencies when vetting applications for credit. Without access to the full register it would be more difficult for lenders to verify an applicant's identity and hence assess their credit risk. They would have to rely upon less complete and accurate data sources, which would increase the cost and difficulty of making such assessments and reduce the quality of the decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would have a number of adverse consequences that would conflict with the public interest. There would be more fraud, as the inability to properly verify identity and address would mean that more fraudulent applications for credit were authorised. The overall cost of credit would increase both because of the increased fraud losses and because the alternative and less effective methods of assessing credit worthiness
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
are more expensive. Those extra losses and costs would be passed back to borrowers generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Less credit would be provided to people who lacked other documentary means of establishing their identity, increasing the problems of financial exclusion. The Government are keen to ensure that all sections of the community have access to financial services, including, where appropriate, credit facilities. Withholding the full register from credit reference agencies will reduce access to credit for people in those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Pete Wishart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that people with credit difficulties simply will not register?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not sure that that will be the outcome. If they are not registered, they will have even more difficulty in getting credit. Credit reference agencies use the electoral roll to verify identity and so on, so a person's absence from the electoral register creates a big difficulty for them in getting access to credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were no access to the full register, a lot more people might find it difficult to get access to credit, unless they had chosen to place themselves on the edited roll, in which case they would be exposing themselves to their personal information being made use of for all kinds of other commercial purposes, which they might not want. The provisions will enable people to have some further proof of their identity, which will be especially useful for those who do not have bank accounts of other forms or identity proof. The electoral register provides the additional source of crucial identity, which might make it easier for people to gain access to credit that they should not rightly be denied. People have different views on financial exclusion, but it is right to strike a balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Luke 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Contrary to what was said earlier, this might encourage more people to register than registered before, and that would make a fuller register. I am reminded of the period of the poll tax. When the Conservative Government introduced that tax in the 1990s, people were escaping in droves from the register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. One hopes that it will be to people's advantage to be on the full electoral roll for credit purposes. Because of the consequences—increased fraud, increased cost of credit and reduced availability, especially to those at risk of financial exclusion—of denying credit reference agencies access to the full register, there is a strong public interest case for continued full access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When an application for credit is the first transaction between any individual and a financial institution, a statutory obligation already exists to verify identity under the money laundering regulations. The credit reference agencies will already have access to the electoral register for money laundering checks, so it is a proportionate additional step to allow them access for credit reference purposes. Again it is in the public interest to have credit made available, efficiently and prudently, to all sectors of the economy with no one sector being particularly disadvantaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Given that strong public interest, the overlap between the use of the full register for money laundering and credit assessment checks, and the fact that people have to consent to those checks, the Government believe that the right balance between individual privacy and public benefit has been struck. We have concluded that it is appropriate for the full register to be available to credit provider organisations. However, the information must be used only for those purposes. The regulations will prevent information from being sold or handed on by recipients such as credit reference agencies for other purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This limited commercial access represents an important public service and a legitimate public aim. It is proportionate to the intrusion into individual privacy and therefore compliant with the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European convention on human rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been waiting patiently to hear what the Minister has to say about regulation 113—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sale of full register to government departments".</p></blockquote>
I confess to being puzzled, particularly as to how much Government Departments are expected to pay. No doubt the Minister will come on to fees in a moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought I had covered those points already. Regulations 110 and 111 set out the fees for selling copies of the full or edited versions of the register. I have already referred to regulation 113, which provides for the sale of the full register to Government Departments, but restricts its use to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the prevention and detection of crime and the enforcement of criminal law … the vetting of employees and applicants for employment, where such vetting is required pursuant to any enactment; and … supply and disclosure"</p></blockquote>
of information to "an authorised person" who may not disclose it except to other authorised persons and only
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purposes for which such a person could obtain a register under the regulation concerned."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that that is what it says, but I am mystified as to why a Government Department should be expected to pay anything for this information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Administrative costs are incurred in compiling the regulations. One could take a different decision, but on account of the administrative costs, I see nothing wrong with it. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but the decision is justifiable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Goodman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Stone asked how much it would cost Government Departments, and I think that the Minister replied that she had covered the point already. My memory may be at fault, but I do not remember her dealing directly with costs. Will she answer the point now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The costs are set out in new regulation 111 (5), including for notices in data form, for which
	<br><blockquote><p>"the fee shall be at the rate of £20 plus £1.50 for each 1,000 entries",</p></blockquote>
and so on. I am happy to read the other costs out for the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not want know the costs, we want to know how they have been arrived at.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are setting the charges because it is the local authority that has to compile the register, administer requests and send it out to organisations. The fees reflect the need to cover administration costs because otherwise local authorities would have to bear them. That is not a huge issue, and the fees are reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the limits imposed by the regulations on authorised recipients of the full register are breached, new regulation 115 will come into play. It creates a criminal offence of information in the full register being passed to an unauthorised person and of unauthorised persons using such data, however they come by them. The regulations affect the decision of Parliament to allow electors to decide, subject to some public interest exceptions, the limit to which their personal information may be used. They represent a legitimate balance between individual rights and the public interest, and I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is a convention in the House that Members joining or leaving a Committee once it is sitting acknowledge the Chair. That has been discussed at the recent meeting of the Speaker's Panel, and there is evidence that it is being comprehensively ignored. The Chairman of Ways and Means has asked me to point out that Members who ignore the convention may in future find it difficult to catch the eye of the Chairman or Speaker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.38 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Butterfill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have raised several points with the Minister as she has gone through her explanation of the regulations. When I first looked at the regulations, I saw that we were dealing with something that went far beyond a minor question that could be dealt with by a statutory instrument. This is effectively a Bill, which we are expected to consider in a relatively short space of time. That explains the intelligent interventions made by my hon. Friends and other hon. Members, which have been important. The Minister has referred continually to the public interest, but the regulations could be construed as a legislative sledgehammer used to crack a nut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real problem is the huge number of restrictions that are imposed on what we would see objectively as legitimate purposes and in democratic interest. Having heard the Minister's explanation on credit reference organisations, I reflected that Members of Parliament, councillors and others might feel that matters relating to electoral fraud or other questions directly germane to the electoral process are just as important—although not necessarily more important—as matters relating to money laundering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more that the Minister spoke about public interest, the more interested I became about from where that public interest stemmed. I hope not to trespass too much on your patience, Mr. Butterfill, but I have a suspicion that it might have been imposed by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
some alien jurisdictional requirement: perhaps European legislation or something along those lines. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I have absolutely no intention of going down that route. The important point is that the regulations are extremely weighty and, irrespective of the fact that they have already been passed in principle by virtue of section 9 of the Representation of the People Act 2000, I have some doubt whether they will work as far as the public is concerned. Even if they do work, it may only be erratically. They are predicated on the assumption that people will ask for their names to be taken off the register because they are concerned about junk mail. I am interested to see whether that happens in practice; I doubt whether it will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also mentioned the fact that the Electoral Commission had to be consulted. I am not criticising the Minister for this, but I asked her whether it was possible to know the outcomes of any written consultations and whether they could be placed in the Library of the House. I say that because the Electoral Commission has an enormously important role in this and other issues that will repeatedly come up in the context of our democratic processes and elections. As she will know, under section 7 of the relevant legislation, the word "consult" in law does not necessarily mean that one has to act on the replies that one receives, but one has to engage in a form of discourse. Did the Electoral Commission have any reservations about any of the provisions? No doubt the Minister will illuminate that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will probably have to come back to this, and I do not want to appear unduly critical, but I have asked four times for a clear statement on whether "electoral purposes" will include funding for political parties. I have not yet had an answer. I regard the point as an important principle, which could determine the ultimate reaction from the Conservatives to the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has explained that the regulations implement section 9 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, that we will now have not only a full register but an edited version, and that many of the issues are tied up with problems relating to data protection and privacy. In the absence of a national identity card scheme, the electoral register is probably the only accurate UK national database, a point that we should consider. Under the terms of the regulations, permitted uses of the full register will include access for the police for law enforcement and crime prevention—the Minister dealt with that in regulation 109—and Government Departments for law enforcement and similar purposes under regulation 113.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also dealt with credit reference agencies. Other uses of the full electoral register that were permitted until now, including for direct marketing, are to be prohibited. The Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001 are a fairly recent set of regulations that were brought into effect on 16 February 2001. All they say about copies of documents is:
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a document is made available for inspection under these Regulations, any person may make a copy (whether hand-written or by other means) of the whole or any part of it."</p></blockquote>
That just meant "open sesame". Many people may think that that was a healthy state of affairs and in the interests of democracy. None the less, the matter was debated, Parliament decided that the register should be divided into two parts, and the Act was passed. I will not engage in challenging that proposition in this Committee. Many people believe that that is a good idea, but I want to put on record that there are significant disadvantages to it. I do not like the sort of secrecy to which this could lead, or the rather draconian way in which the regulations are devised. Their restrictions include substantial fines of up to standard level 5. Again, that was conceded in the Act, but none the less, we are talking about fines of up to £5,000. The more I think about this, the more I would like to know what the Electoral Commission had to say about it. It may have thought that this was a wonderful idea, but I have my reservations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that a wide range of organisations, including Liberty, have supported the proposals. In an article in 
	<i>The Independent</i> on 7 May 2002, Roger Bingham was said to have stated that the Government's position strikes a good balance between protecting individual privacy and allowing bona fide organisations access to important information. That is something of an endorsement from Liberty. Other organisations, some of which have already been mentioned, include the Council of Mortgage Lenders, the British Bankers Association, and the National Consumer Council. I would prefer more openness and transparency but, despite my personal reservations, those organisations have made it clear that they are in favour of the regulations. We need an answer to my concern about the definition of "electoral purposes", and how the Electoral Commission or the courts will interpret it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The newly inserted regulations 104 and 106 give rise to another concern. Holders of elected office and registered political parties may use the electoral register for electoral purposes. They may also use it to comply with the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 when deciding whether to accept a donation. Under regulation 105, the use of the register by associations does not fit into the general framework. Associations do, of course, receive donations, and I would be grateful if she could also clarify that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have other concerns. The Direct Marketing Association, with the support of various charitable groups and the Consumers Association, believes that it should have been possible for the full register to be used indirectly for marketing purposes by allowing the addresses of people on existing mailing lists to be checked against the register. The Minister may have heard that before from other sources, but I should be grateful if she would comment on it during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other side of the equation, the Electoral Commission, so I am informed, has argued that there should be no access to the electoral register by anyone outside the Government for any purpose other than electoral purposes, and no edited register. That is an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
important point, which bears on what I said about electoral purposes, and a substantial issue on which I should be grateful for the Minister's comments. What is the Government's view about what the Electoral Commission is said to have argued in that context?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many commercial organisations support the thrust of the regulations but they believe that access to the electoral register by registered credit reference agencies and banks should be allowed for the prevention of fraud and financial crime, as was stated in the initial version of regulation 113. It is an ongoing process; I think the Minister will recognise that what I am saying applies not only to the money laundering regulations of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. I should be grateful if she would explain why there was a shift in the arrangements expressed in the initial version of the regulations—especially regulation 113—published by the Government in April 2001.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In about a year's time, the Government are due to review section 9 of the Representation of the People Act 2000. I did not participate in the parliamentary debates on that Act, at any rate from the Front Bench. I might have made one or two comments if I had had the opportunity to do so. Apparently, the review is primarily to consider the question of new provisions— [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I beg your pardon, Mr. Butterfill. It must have been my reference to electronic voting that triggered that unexpected interruption. Would that not be a good opportunity to review the manner in which the regulations operate, because there are continuing concerns about it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many organisations that have considered the regulations over an extended period are in wide agreement that there is merit in these arrangements. I have expressed my concern; time will tell whether it was justified. I want an answer to the question relating to electoral purposes and their relationship to political funding. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I point out that the Committee is time limited? Our deliberations are due to finish at 11.25 am.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heath</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important set of regulations and the time allotted to it hardly does justice to the complexities of the issues raised. Its genesis has been somewhat protracted; it has been through at least three Government Departments—the Home Department via the Department for Transport, Local Government, and the Regions and the Lord Chancellor's Department. It has been something of a hot potato, if a potato can remain hot over such a long period. It is a rather tepid tuber by now. Nevertheless, it is important that we get it right and, as the Minister said, the need to do so has been exacerbated by the Robertson v. City of Wakefield MDC and the Home Department case. We have made it clear that even if nothing had been brought forward in the previous
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
legislation a new interpretation of the regulations would have been needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In broad terms, I welcome the proposals. Although it is difficult, they manage to strike a balance. However, a number of important questions still need to be asked. Much will depend on interpretation. That is where I entirely concur with the hon. Member for Stone; we need some guidance from the Minister, in particular on the use of the registers by political parties, candidates and those in elected office. On a Pepper 
	<i>v.</i> Hart basis, such guidance could be of extreme value to the Electoral Commission in doing its job. It appears to come to the issue with a degree of preconception, which could make life difficult if those preconceptions are consolidated by what the Minister has to say. I would prefer a more liberal approach—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I hope that I can use the English language in a sensible way in this Committee. I would hope for a more liberal interpretation of what is proposed for political parties because otherwise there could be unforeseen and quite unnecessary difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Osborne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be a problem with independent candidates. My predecessor in Parliament was an independent. As such candidates only declare themselves close to the time of the election and would not have a local party, by definition, they will have access to the register only a matter of weeks before the election, whereas their opponents have access many months in advance; not that it helped the Conservatives much in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heath</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. That is the penalty that a candidate would pay for being independent of a political party. They could purchase an edited copy of the register so that they would have at least partial information. But until such time as they were a declared candidate, as I understand the regulation, they would not have access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also have some concerns about the duty that the regulations place on members of political parties in carrying out canvassing activities elsewhere. It is only too easy to envisage the canvass card that is dropped accidentally, creating a criminal offence if it disclosed part of the full register to a person who was not qualified to receive that information. We might have all sorts of difficulties in that respect. Will the provisions within these regulations become extinct as the register becomes extinct? In other words, when a new register is used, is the old register still protected in its entirety on the same basis, until the end of time, or does it then become public property?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) raised a serious issue about Scotland. I cannot for the life of me understand how, during the long gestation of these regulations, it has not been possible to draw up regulations that cover MSPs, or for the Scotland Office to produce parallel regulations to amend section 12 of the Scotland Act 1998 to make appropriate regulations. As the section deals exclusively with electoral arrangements and not with the use of the register in pursuit of the normal democratic processes that is allowed for Members of this House, Members of the European Parliament and councillors, it may be an unexpected and unfortunate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
restriction on the use by MSPs. Unless the Parliamentary Secretary can come up with a satisfactory response, I shall be less inclined to support the Scottish part of the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend's comments about access by MSPs. The other point is that lay people or amateurs have traditionally fought elections in Britain. We do not want elections to be fought purely by legal experts; we want electoral law to be simple. As my hon. Friend has said, it would make much more sense to list in one place all the officeholders who were allowed to receive copies of the full register, rather than having to go to the Scotland Act to find out in relation to MSPs. As far as elections are concerned, the Scotland Act should consist only of statutes where Scottish elections are different. Where things are common to all elections, they should be in one place; the Representation of the People Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heath</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a very valid point. Heaven forbid that all our elected representatives should be lawyers. The mood of the debate has generally been in favour of consolidating legislation, but now we are talking about an active pursuit of non-consolidation in putting different parts of the electoral law—the most basic part of our constitutional law—in different places and having to interrelate one to another. That seems rather foolish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the wording of the opt-out—the application to be removed from the edited list—which is set out in the schedule to the regulations. I have no difficulty with the two versions of the register section of the schedule and the form of words that is to be used, but are these the only words that may be used, or are electoral registration officers permitted to put a gloss on them? That would have a considerable effect on the likelihood or otherwise of people wishing to remove their names from the edited register. They may be advised not to have their name on the register, because they would be sent a lot of direct marketing mail. Alternatively, they may be told that it is to their advantage to be on the register, because it may help them in credit, leasing or hire purchase applications. That would make a great difference to the way in which people perceive the option, so I should be grateful for the Parliamentary Secretary's guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stone dealt to a degree with the basic question of whether the provision of the full register to financial organisations should be on the narrow basis of the provisions in the regulations or on a wider basis that would allow a rather fuller pursuit of those who may be engaged in fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary will know that that is of great concern because she will have had representations from the various organisations. She says that there is a balanced argument. Without wishing to intrude too much on the workings of her Department and others, I simply wonder whether the balance is between those outside, who want a slightly broader view to be taken, and civil servants and people at the Electoral Commission, who are arguing for a narrow interpretation. It would be unfortunate if that were so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
I can see merit in the points that have been made to me that certain areas fall outside the precise terms of the money laundering legislation, and that using the information could be of value in fighting fraud. The hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) made the point that finance and leasing associations are not included in the description about credit for these purposes. Another point, which I do not think has been raised, concerns the duty of credit agencies under data protection legislation to allow interested people to inspect their own files. That poses a real problem, because they cannot use the electoral register to assure themselves that the person asking to inspect the file is the person who claims to be such a person. Complying with data protection legislation might perpetrate a disclosure that could be used for fraudulent purposes. That is a serious difficulty, which the Parliamentary Secretary should examine. It may need a change of interpretation or of regulation in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious of time advancing and we want to ensure that the Parliamentary Secretary has ample opportunity to respond to the issues. My final comment returns us to the last point of the hon. Member for Stone. Section 9 of the Representation of the People Act 2000 provides scope for review of the regulations. Other matters will inevitably have to be covered as we continue to adapt and modernise electoral law in this country. We have an appropriate vehicle for reviewing the regulations and attempting to improve them in the light of experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Broadly, the Liberal Democrats welcome the changes. I hope that they will go some way to redressing the balance and avoiding the mischief of using the electoral register for commercial purposes against people's wishes; a practice that has continued without interruption since 1832. It is hardly a new problem, but modern IT processes have exacerbated it. Some of the questions raised in the debate require specific answers, which I look forward to hearing later this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.6 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to respond to the various issues raised in the debate. The hon. Member for Stone wondered about the definition of public interest and asked whether credit reference agencies provisions had been imposed on us. I can assure him that that is not the case. The proposals emerged from discussions with different organisations about the likely impact on financial exclusion, access to credit and so forth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stone also asked about the Electoral Commission's evidence. I understand that it is posted on its web site. The hon. Gentleman must have had sight of some aspects, because parts of his speech referred to them. The Electoral Commission argued that the register should not be made available for anything other than electoral purposes, but the Government disagreed on the public interest grounds that I have set out today. The hon. Gentleman said that he objected to the secrecy, but his viewpoint is different from the Electoral Commission's. However, it also suggested that the edited register should not be made available and asked the Government to reconsider. The register should be available if people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
have consented to their names appearing on it; that makes it a legitimate tool for commercial purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the balance between internal and external arguments. The views of external bodies varied widely. It was not the case that all the outside bodies urged one viewpoint and the Government took a different one; quite the reverse. The Electoral Commission took one view, credit reference organisations took another and financial organisations still another. We listened to all organisations and tried to strike the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about top-up Members. They will have access to all of the London registers. In terms of the change in comparison with last April's publication about money laundering legislation, that came in the light of the decision in the Robertson case, which led us to ensure that the provisions were fully compliant with the Human Rights Act 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Electoral registration officers have discretion on the wording of the register as long as they provide words to the same effect. A strong recommendation to voters to act one way or another would not have the same effect as the wording in the schedule. Does it apply when the register is out of date? Yes, it does. I shall reflect further on the interesting points made about the Data Protection Act 1998, which the regulations do not cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fundamental questions were asked about the nature of "electoral purposes". It is a broad concept and it is right to adopt a liberal interpretation of what it means. It should be defined as anything to do with the process of campaigning and getting elected. Fundraising for the purposes of winning elections is part of "electoral purposes" and the regulations cover the circumstances when political parties seek to raise funds. It would be different if money were being raised to buy equipment for a local hospital or other purpose, but fundraising for the core purpose of communicating with voters and campaigning to get elected clearly counts as "electoral purposes".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations apply to the period between elections—we are not talking only about when the gun has been fired and the election campaign is under way—and equally to people who are not members of political parties. If they are standing for election, they should have access to the electoral register for electoral purposes. It would be inappropriate to disadvantage people on the basis of political background or the issues on which they wanted to campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right not to pin down "electoral purposes" too narrowly. We do not want to omit anything that counts as an important part of what political parties and those seeking to represent the people in a democracy should be able to do to communicate with voters. Voters themselves should have their human right to participate in free and fair elections recognised. In a democracy, it is crucial to sustain those principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stone asked about regulations 104 and 105. Regulation 105 deals with local parties for electoral purposes, which is why it does not refer to donations. Regulation 106 deals with political parties' role in donations and covers using the
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
electoral register to check political donations. Regulation 104 deals with the role of individuals in donations. He raised an important issue, but the regulations cover it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Pete Wishart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard nothing about enforcement. If credit companies or political parties use the list inappropriately, how will the regulations be policed and enforced?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Enforcement provisions are set out under the regulations. I am rapidly trying to flick through to find them. The hon. Gentleman is right that there is no point in setting out regulations if they are not to be enforced. Reference is made to enforcement in regulation 115. Obviously the Government take that very seriously. The Information Commissioner and the Electoral Commissioner would also take it seriously if these regulations were not complied with. Hon. Members also asked about reviewing these regulations. Certainly the enforcement and operation of these regulations could be considered over time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might also be convenient to include the question of funding as part of the definition of electoral purposes. Perhaps on reflection the definition of "electoral purposes" could be refined, as it is vague. There are problems and the Parliamentary Secretary has acknowledged that in her statements, for which we are grateful. The matter could be narrowed by some delicate drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree. If we try to pin it down too much, we may create the contrary effect and restrict various things that we might all agree should legitimately be part of electoral purposes. I hope that I have made my view clear that fundraising is part of the electoral purposes. Clearly if there were problems with the interpretation of the regulations we would have to look at it again. Our view for the time being is that the phrase "electoral purposes" is deliberately broad and should include anything that is for the purpose of seeking election and representing the public in a democracy. It is right to include fundraising. Clearly, if that becomes a problem we will have to look at it again. I hope that it will not prevent any legitimate fundraising by political parties need to do in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heath</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary. There is a great deal of merit in leaving a slightly fuzzy definition provided—it is a big proviso—that the Electoral Commission interprets it in line with what she has said. Her comments have been extremely useful. I hope that it will be drawn to the attention of the Electoral Commission, and that it will take careful note of what she has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly 
	<i>Hansard</i> reports can be used by the courts and across the board to interpret the legislation. That is why I was so keen not to respond too quickly and inappropriately to some of the points that were made earlier and to ensure that we do not inadvertently narrow the scope of the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has not answered the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) and I made about section 12 of the Scotland Act being a power
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
only to make provisions about elections whereas regulation 102 gives all other elected office holders the power to access the register by virtue of their office. Even if powers under section 12 were used, MSPs would not be given the register by virtue of their office, but only for election purposes. There is also no good reason why MSPs are not listed under these regulations. Why do we have to repeat them elsewhere?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clear advice is that section 12 of the Scotland Act is the right place to have the appropriate powers to make those provisions for MSPs. It will also ensure that MSPs are entitled to use the electoral register on exactly the same basis and from the same time scale. I am assured that it is clearly not intended that MSPs be treated any differently but that the nature of the Scotland Act requires that the arrangements be made under that section rather than
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
alongside the provisions that we are discussing today. I hope that I have covered all the points raised in the debate. These are important regulations and I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
