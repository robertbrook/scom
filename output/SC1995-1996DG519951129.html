	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Water Undertakings (Rateable Values) (Scotland) (No. 2) Order I 995.—[

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Docks and Harbours (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Amendment (No. 2) Order 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should explain that, as soon as the first order is put, I shall ask the Minister to move the second motion formally and the Question will then be put without further debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.31 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I wish to register my appreciation of the interest shown by Conservative Members in these two important Scottish orders. It is refreshing to see the Minister outnumbered not only by ex-Ministers, but even by ex-Cabinet Ministers. It shows the seriousness with which the Government currently take Scottish issues—no doubt, because they realise that the election will soon be upon them when they are likely to be wiped out in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that this is the last occasion on which such an order will be considered by a Committee of the House. Later this afternoon, we expect to hear an announcement by the Secretary of State for Scotland about Scotland and the Union. We expect him to announce changes to the way in which business is conducted by Parliament, with the result that more Committees will take place in Scotland and be attended by more Scottish Members of Parliament. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I am pleased to see that the Government think that that is a good idea, as do people in Scotland. Certainly, the lack of Opposition Members present in Committee in no way indicates a lack of interest. My hon. Friends the Members for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey) and for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) are far away on Scottish business with the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs and cannot be present this afternoon. I hope that their apologies will be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall say a few words about each order in turn and deal first with the order relating to docks and harbours. I understand that the order will amend another order of 1990, which deals with the basis on which docks and harbours pay rates to local authorities in Scotland. As I understand it, the order will change the calculation that forms the basis on which docks and harbours pay rates. Their income will be assessed over a 12-month period immediately prior to 31 December 1992 to 31 March 1993. I assume that all docks and harbours have different financial years and that that is why different dates are included in the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
To deal with the Dundee port authority in my constituency, with which I am familiar, its financial year runs from December to December. Therefore, I assume that its rateable value will be based on its income during the 12 months from 31 December 1991 to 31 December 1992, but I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm that. I do not have the figures for the port authority's income in that year, and the Library does not have any reports and accounts for the Dundee port authority because they are held somewhere else. However, I know that, between 1993 and 1994, a year in which the port authority invested almost £2 million in building two new warehouses and a new mobile crane at the harbour, revenue increased by some £323,000. It went up from a little more than £5 million to £5,365,000. Indeed, profits in that year went up from £89,000 or 10.7 per cent. That indicates that the year 1993–94 was a far better year for the port than 1992–93, but I assume that both years were far better than the year 1991–92.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us why we are dealing with amendments at the end of 1995 when the rateable value is based on the income of those ports and authorities many years ago? Is that being done to ensure that ports and harbours will pay less in rates than they would if the amendment had taken the 1993–94 income into account rather than that from 1991–92? I am sure that the Minister will give me a reasonable explanation, but my suspicion is that he is interested in ensuring that businesses such as port authorities pay less rates than they would otherwise have to, and therefore increase their income and make higher profits. That is particularly interesting because the Dundee port authority was privatised this year following a decision taken by the port authority board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) growling in appreciation of that decision. Perhaps he will not be doing so when he sees the consequences of the privatisation for the people of Dundee and the business which goes through the harbour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Initially, the privatisation was sought in the form of a management-employee buy-out under the name of Caledonian Ports Ltd. We were assured that as a result of the privatisation the port would enjoy fuller commercial opportunities and greater freedoms than it would while it remained as a trust port. Coincidentally, in the year in which it applied for privatisation, there was a downturn in the business going through the port and therefore its income such that, for the first time in many years, the port authority had to bring out a mini financial statement in the middle of its application for privatisation. I am not a suspicious man, but even I started to suspect something. The chairman told me that in his 21 years' experience as chairman of the port he had never known that to happen. No doubt the Minister believes that it is just coincidence that there had to be a mini statement on the downturn—which could affect the price for which the port was eventually sold to the private sector—in the very year in which it applied for privatisation. I am certainly suspicious of those circumstances; perhaps Conservative Members have no such suspicions, because they would support a much lower price being paid for a valuable port such as Dundee by the private sector as long as it meant privatisation. They believe in privatisation at any cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
In the event, the management-employee buy-out failed and the port was sold instead to one of the major competitors of the Dundee port authority—Forth Ports Ltd., which has taken over and controls the Dundee port authority. That gives rise to a number of questions in relation to the order. Forth Ports will be paying rates to Edinburgh unitary council or one of the other Lothian unitary councils on the basis of its income at Forth ports. It will also now be paying rates to Dundee unitary authority based on its income at Dundee ports. What steps will the Minister be taking to ensure that a private sector company such as Forth Ports Ltd. cannot so arrange business between two ports that it owns as to minimise its contribution to local authorities and escape the higher liability that it would face if the ports were held in separate ownership? I should be grateful if the Minister could give me an assurance that the Government will keep a close eye on the way in which those two ports pay rates to their local authorities, because that is an important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Water Undertakings (Rateable Values) (Scotland) (No. 2) order 1995 sets out the basis on which the new quangos will pay rates to local authorities in return for the services which they receive from them. Previously, local authorities paid rates to themselves, because they were the water and sewerage authorities until the Government changed that position. The basis on which local authorities paid themselves rates was established by agreement between the assessors and local authorities at a time described to me by an official of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities as the dim and distant past. The contribution basis agreed then has simply been rolled on every year since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When that was all controlled by the local authorities, the basis on which they paid rates did not matter much because they were paying rates to themselves and were unlikely to try to cheat themselves of the rates for which they were liable. Of course, the position is very different now. Responsibility for water has been undemocratically snatched away from local authorities in Scotland and vested in unelected quangos. That gives rise to a different series of questions. Quangos have no loyalty whatever to democratically elected local government. If they can pay the minimum amount in return for exacting the maximum amount of services from the local authorities, they will do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows that the new water charges will be collected by the local authorities in Scotland because he has introduced regulations enforcing local authorities to collect such charges on behalf of the new quangos. He may say that that service will be paid for by the water quangos but it is how the money will be collected that is offensive. Local authorities have to pay all the moneys due up front to the quangos and if there is a shortfall because of non-payment by campaigners such as Tommy Sheridan, the local authorities—not the quangos—must suffer the shortfall. They will receive the full amount due to them. The local authorities will lose out considerably because of the inability of some people and the unwillingness of others to pay the new water charges. Local council tax payers could end up subsidising those unelected water quangos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must make absolutely sure that quangos pay their fair share of the rates. That will not happen under the proposed regulations. The way in which
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
quangos will pay the rates is not based on a proper evaluation of their business. I understand that it is based on exactly the same arrangements that have been in place for many years when local authorities had responsibility for water and sewerage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain why he has not based the contribution of quangos on exactly the same basis that applies to ports and harbours in Scotland? Why is the contribution not based on the year's income and turnover of quangos, instead of continuing the old system of assessing rateable values that have been inherited from local authorities? I understand that it is not possible to do that for the first year, 1996-97, because quangos do not yet know what their incomes will be, but after the first year it would be possible to base their contribution on the turnover that they achieve in year one. I do not understand why that has not been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4 sets out rateable values for 1996–97 and 1999–2000. That is in accordance with the formula set out in paragraph 5 and I do not think that many members of the Committee fully understand that formula. I suspect that it is not based on any proper evaluation of the business or assets of the quangos. I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify that and explain why not? Costs that must be met by quangos will be passed on to the poor consumers of water and sewerage facilities in Scotland. Only last week, on 24 November, 
	<i>The Herald</i> pointed out
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the East of Scotland Authority, based in Edinburgh, has calculated that it needs an increase of around 25 per cent. in charges compared to this year to meet its spending requirements."</p></blockquote>
An increase of 25 per cent. on water consumers in Scotland is enormous. The article continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Ministers are understood to have told the three new public authorities that they will not sanction increases of more than 15 per cent. next year."</p></blockquote>
On 28 November, a further article in 
	<i>The Herald</i> stated that the Secretary of State for Scotland
	<br><blockquote><p>"is ready to step in and cap the rises at an average of just 6 per cent."</p></blockquote>
I should like the Minister to confirm whether that is so as it would have consequences for water quangos. The article also stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such a tight charging limit, however, will present the new water and sewerage authorities with enormous problems. The chairman of the West of Scotland Water Authority, Mr. John Jameson, said it would be 'very difficult' to make savings … He said spending would have to rise by around 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. and it was hard to see where cutbacks could come. The largest part of the increase was taken up by paying interest on the capital debt and in paying rates to councils for the installations inherited by the authority."</p></blockquote>
Given the remarks made by the chairman of the West of Scotland Water Authority, who was appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland, do the Government intend to write off the capital debt that the new quangos will inherit from the local authorities next year? If so, taxpayers will subsidise the new quangos. Do the Government intend to featherbed the amount of rates paid by the new water quangos to local authorities under the formula within the order? If so, council tax payers will also subsidise the quangos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 28 November, an editorial in 
	<i>The Herald</i> stated that, if Ministers succeed in capping the increase in water charges at 6 per cent.,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Consumers will not be up in arms at double-digit increases on their water bills and so an area of political awareness which is totally unfavourable to the Government will steadily lose its salience."</p></blockquote>
It would be fine for the Government to get away with a 6 per cent. cap on increases in water charges if that 6 per cent. cap were not subsidised by both taxpayers, because the Government write off the water quangos' capital debt, and council tax payers, because the Government featherbed the rates water quangos pay to local authorities. Before the orders come into force, the Minister must clarify the Government's policy on such matters. I look forward to his response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.47 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond. The orders are not especially controversial; they are entirely technical. I assure the Committee that they are straightforward and innocuous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In February, the House approved a water undertakings order which prescribed the 1995-96 rateable values for existing water companies, regional and island councils and the Central Scotland Water Development Board. At the same time, the House approved similar orders which prescribed rateable values for the current year and arrangements for them to be updated each year until the next revaluation in 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only reason that similar orders could not deal with the water undertakings was that, with effect from 1 April 1996, they would be restructured under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order simply updates the rateable values for water undertakings in accordance with the formula approved by the House on several previous occasions. It attributes the aggregate rateable values to the new water undertakings on the basis of the allocation of relevant lands and heritages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that, compared to the rateable values approved by the House for existing water undertakings, the draft order neither increases nor decreases the rateable values attributed to the new water authorities. The draft order provides the annual updating for the remainder of the current rating quinquennium as is done under similar orders, which were approved by the House, for the other utilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal briefly with the hon. Gentleman's questions. On write-offs, the Scottish Office is discussing with COSLA the transfer of the debt. On prices, the detail of charges is a matter for each water authority and the Customers Council to resolve. The financial arrangements that have been announced are consistent with the average increase of no more than 6 per cent. in case terms. There
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
might be variations about the average; that is for the water authorities and the Customers Council to discuss. The water authorities face a heavy investment programme, which must be paid for. Six per cent. is very much lower than the figures of 15 per cent. and even 25 per cent., which the hon. Member for Dundee, East mentioned a moment ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the basis of assessment. The radical changes to the method of assessment have in the past been phased in. Revaluation has taken place every five years. The changes envisaged by the mid-quinquennium have been avoided for the sake of stability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second order relates to docks and harbours. I can tell the hon. Gentleman emphatically that the purpose is not to introduce lower rates. It simply ensures that all docks and harbours are assessed in relaton to 1995-96. The unamended order contained a loophole for some cases and it was necessary to achieve consistency. The only effect of the order is to change the relevant year for comparison from 1990–91 to 1995–96. That was the intention of the original order, which unfortunately contained one or two technical omissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the Dundee port authority, the ratepayers affected by the docks and harbours orders were all consulted and had no substantive comments on the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order rectifies earlier technical omissions which would have meant that some docks and harbours were covered by the 1995 revaluation, but others were not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the order was linked with privatisation. I can tell him that it arises from advice to Ministers from the independent assessors, following their scrutiny of the detail. The rates are pooled for Scottish local government as a whole. The Scottish Office then apportions the total on a population basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
