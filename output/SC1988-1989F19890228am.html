	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 172, in page 9, line 45, at beginning insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"()Insection63(2)ofthel986Act,afterparagraph(c)there shall be inserted the following paragraph:—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'(d) where any sum mentioned in subsection (1) is not increased by the order or is increased by less than the percentage by which the general level of prices is greater at the end of the period than it was at the beginning, stating his reasons for, and the estimated annual saving in expenditure resulting from, not increasing it by that percentage.'.".</p></blockquote>
It is a shame that we are not meeting tomorrow which will be even brighter. We are meeting on the eve of St. David's day and we look forward to intertwining our daffodils with our roses and we welcome the victor from Pontypridd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with uprating. At present benefits fall into three groups: those which by law have to be uprated, at least in line with prices, those which in practice are uprated more or less in line with prices and those which lose value from year to year because they are not uprated in line with prices. The latter category concerns us here. Even when benefits go up in line with prices as earnings and other incomes tend to rise in real terms, benefit rates fall steadily begind other incomes. Those on benefit fail to gain from the relative increase in prosperity that the rest of the nation is enjoying. If benefits cannot be increased in real terms it is better to have them increased in line with prices but the worst problem is that their real value is eroded by inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is already required to list in his annual uprating order all the benefits listed in section 63(1) of the Social Security Act 1986. But he does not have to specify which are not being increased or are rising by less than the inflation rate. The amendment requires him to do that and to explain his reasons for not increasing those benefits in line with prices and the consequences of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Benefits which are not rising with prices this April include the £1,000 widow's payment. That was discussed at some length in the debate on uprating on 20 December. My hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) referred to the Government's illusionist's trick—first we see the benefits, then we do not. The proposal to substitute the lump sum payment for weekly widow's allowance was first announced in
	<span class='label label-info column'>792</span>
June 1985 under the misnomer of a social security reform. Since then, including this autumn's uprating, other benefits have risen by about 22 per cent which means that widows should now receive £1,220 instead of £1,000. Women who were foolish enough to imagine that they stood to gain from this "reform" will now have been disillusioned. The widow's payment is worth almost £600 less than the uprated benefit it replaced—widow's allowance paid weekly for the first six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Child benefit will doubtless be covered at great length elsewhere. It has already been debated on the Floor of the House and I do not want to spend too much time on it now. However, it is worth noting the effect that freezing child benefit has on the value of other benefits. Widows are among those who have been short changed. This year a widowed mother receives £15.65 for each of her children, consisting of an £8.40 dependency increase to a widow's benefit, and the £7.25 child benefit. From this April she will receive £16.20—the £8.95 dependency increase and the £7.25 child benefit. That represents an actual increase of a mere 3.5 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government claim that long-term benefits, including widow's benefits, are going up by 5.9 per cent. The same is true of invalidity benefit. The long-term sick with children are getting a smaller increase than those without children. Like widowed mothers, they are not even being compensated for price increases over the past year. The earnings limit is a matter that continues, justifiably, to receive a great deal of attention. The amount that a pensioner can earn without loss of pension has been frozen at £75 for the fourth year running.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an interesting history to the Government's earnings limit. The 1979 Conservative manifesto stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is wrong to discourage people who wish to work after retirement age, and we will phase out the 'earnings rule' during the next Parliament."</p></blockquote>
However, instead of phasing it out, in 1980 the Government abolished the statutory obligation to uprate it, which was not what they promised. The Government spokesman in the House of Lords, Lord Cullen, had the grace to be apologetic when he said on 16 June:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we consider that the present economic situation in the country is very bad",—
	<i>[Official Report, House of Lords;</i> Vol. 410, c.928.]</p></blockquote>
Inflation was running at 22 per cent, so perhaps it was the shape of things to come. We sympathise with him, which is why we are having to eat our words in our manifesto commitment. That was probably a reasonable standpoint in 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Secretary of State said on 7 May 1980:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I give to the Committee … this categorical pledge that the Government remain committed to abolishing the rule because it acts as a disincentive to those aged between 60 and 65 for women and 65 to 70 for men who want to continue working. It is socially undesirable that people who want to continue contributing should have a disincentive to do so. These reasons still remain as valid as ever they were."—
	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 7 May 1980; c.758.]</p></blockquote>
Briefings from Age Concern and other bodies show how much they are concerned in 1989 about the same
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>793</span>
matter. The 1983 Conservative manifesto confirmed
	<br><blockquote><p>"our intention to continue raising the limit and to abolish this earnings rule as soon as we can".</p></blockquote>
In the 1987 manifesto the Government were having to eat their words. It did not mention the earnings rules at all. It had gone through the processes of being eaten and digested and was then evacuated. Since we have been liberated from our language taboos by Mr. Speaker, I am tempted to describe it in more graphic terms, but I shall resist doing so. To restore the earnings limit to the same value as it had in 1979 would mean raising it from £75 to about £100. To match the increase in average earnings, however, it would have to be raised to £125. That would be the fair thing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is not only the pensioners' earnings limit that has been frozen. The amount that a carer can earn and still receive invalid care allowance has been forzen at £12 a week since 1982. It would be interesting to know what reason the Secretary of State would give for that in the annual uprating order, if amendment No. 172 were accepted. We should like to know his reason for freezing such a valuable allowance as the invalid care allowance which has brought so much real help to many families who have major difficulties in living a reasonable life. It gives them only £12, which acts as a crucial lubricant and allows them to live a reasonable life, without too much of the drudgery of invalidity care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why has the £85 maternity payment, which is now means tested, been frozen again this year? I presume that it is simply to save money. The maternity benefit from the social fund is targeted specifically on the poorest mothers and was first halved—as compared with what the poorest mothers used to get—and then frozen at £85, but it must meet the same expenses as the £180 that the mother received two years ago. A book entitled "Maternity Benefits" published in 1985 by Brown and Small estimated that the cost for the first child was £250.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The occupational pension limit, above which unemployment benefit is reduced, is to be frozen yet again at £35. In none of those cases is there an obvious justification of why the Government have decided that the benefits should be placed in permafrost. Will the Minister explain his reasons?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Minister for Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott):</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> The hon. Gentleman has run through a catalogue of instances in which the Government, for good reasons, have decided—where they have been free to do so—not to uprate benefits in line with price rises. Many benefits have to be uprated in line with prices, but others do not. The Government should be able to decide their public expenditure priorities. For example, it would cost £250 million to abolish the earnings rule for pensions. That is a significant sum and the priority to be accorded to such a move must be weighed against other demands on the public purse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although child benefit has not been uprated for two years, substantial extra resources have been put in to help low-paid families—those who are on income support or family credit. Instead of spreading the available money thinly across all families, we thought it better to
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
concentrate on the poorest families, as research shows that they have real needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Government have made substantial improvements to invalid care allowance. We extended it to people caring for non-relatives in December 1984 and to married women in June 1986, and we doubled the earnings limit to £12 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are examples of the way in which the Government should be able to judge relative priorities. However, the amendment asks the Government to publish in a statutory instrument the reasons why they are not uprating a particular benefit. It would be a remarkable use of secondary legislation not to give effect to Government policy, but to set out reasons to justify it. I can think of no other circumstance in which secondary legislation has been used for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary, because my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has a statutory duty, each year, to lay an uprating order before the House. He makes a statement explaining what he proposes to do and why, and he is closely questioned. On the last occasion that he made such a statement, he explained clearly why he had decided not to increase child benefit from April. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer makes an Autumn Statement following the outcome of the public expenditure round each year. He, too, is closely questioned about his judgments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have an annual benefits uprating order, subject to the affirmative procedure, which allows ample opportunity for discussion. The Opposition need no reminder from me about their opportunities to raise questions with Ministers if they believe that anything is going wrong or being concealed. The White Paper on public expenditure gives a vast amount of information about those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would not give hon. Members access to any more information than that available to them through other, more accessible and appropriate, means. Legislation is not the place to include such information. I urge the hon. Gentleman not to press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a depressing reply, because clearly we have not got our serious point across to the Minister. There are two, or possibly three classes of benefit, and they are of equal importance. Large amounts of money are involved. If we had to put them in a hierarchy—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Would the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) please dress himself appropriately for Committee and unhat himself?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that I am facing in this direction—I do not know what happens behind me. Permissiveness is clearly running riot in this place. This will be remembered as the month of debauchery. I wonder where it will end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All benefits are of importance and value and should increase by at least the level of inflation. There is no justification for benefits not doing so. Will the Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>795</span>
explain why there are exceptions? Why have maternity payments been frozen? Maternity benefit from the social fund is specifically targeted on the poorest mothers. The Minister referred to the abolition of the earnings limit for pensioners and the amount of money involved. The Minister is not strapped for money. We are asbout to throw away permanently much of the £2.6 billion in the national insurance fund to reverse a policy that we have followed since 1911. There is no question of there being a shortage of money. The money would be forthcoming if the Secretary of State put up a fight for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have argued about child benefit before and shall do so again. We look forward to rebellious Conservative Members moving to include child benefit in the upratings that must be brought about. A benefits system has been created. It is illogical and indefensible for selective benefits for the worst off in society to be allowed to wither on the vine by being excluded from the annual uprating on the whim of the Minister and with no explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may wish to remind the Committee that we are particularly anxious about that because, not so long ago, the Chancellor of the Exchequer took great pains to draw the attention of a group of journalists the distinction between benefits that have to be uprated and those that did not. He did that in a manner and tone—and that part, at least, is not In dispute—which implied that those benefits may wither away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We remember the famous occasion that gave rise to the Lawson embarrassment bonus, or LEB money. That is not quite hush money; it might be described as blush money. The extraordinary episode in which the money suddenly became available revealed that the Government were keen to cover up a guilty secret. We fear that that may be behind their thinking on this issue; it may be the reason for not wishing to publish details of why they are maintaining the illogical and indefensible uprating of some benefits while leaving others to fade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall raise the matter later but I beg now to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 173, in page 10, line 13, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) If the Secretary of State is satisfied that the value of any amount presecribed for the purposes of section 22(1) above is less than the value of the corresponding amount in paragraph 2.4 of the Technical Annex to the White Paper "Reform of Social Security" (Cmnd. 9691), taking into account the increases in the general level of prices taken into account in upratings of benefits in 1986 and subsequent years and any adjustment made in those upratings to compensate for the liability to pay rates or community charge, he shall by order increase the amount so presecribed by the amount necessary to restore its value."</p></blockquote>
The amendment has a different purpose to the amendment so ably moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), who is clearly on excellent form this morning; perhaps it is the weather. It draws attention to some of the other problems that arise from the way in which the Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>796</span>
have chosen to uprate benefits. The amendment refers to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Technical Annex to the White Paper"</p></blockquote>
which I am sure is impressed on your memory, Mr. Winterton, because I remember the Select Committee taking a substantial amount of evidence on the proposals. The Government have always insisted that the figures were illustrative and were intended to give an idea of the framework and structure of the proposed new system of income support, family credit and housing benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government published the White Paper in December 1985. They referred continually to the figures in the Technical Annex as illustrative figures, but it would be fair to say that they created the impression that this was to maintain a line of defence against the clear implications of some of the figures. For example the most severely hit individual losers are likely to be the most severely disabled people. Most of us think that that chimes in rather ill with the Government's claim that their wish in devising the new system is to target benefits on those in greatest need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government directed their remarks about the figures being illustrative towards those parts of the new structure where the new rates were seen to have potentially damaging effects. In general, those rates are intended to be comparable with the rates of benefit being paid in 1985. Taking account of subsequent upratings, they will form the bedrock and floor of the new system. If that is not the intention, the numbers of gainers and losers calculated in the figures in the Technical Annex are even more misleading than they appear to be. I think we can take it that the rates are broadly intended to be the rates for the new system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most notable points about the framework is that despite the new system of a basic rate of income support and the various premia for various circumstances, which mean that some people will receive an improved income under the new system, one group of people fails to obtain any real improvement. Speaking from memory, they will get 5p more according to illustrative rates, than they were receiving at the time. That group is the unemployed, in particular the long-term unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no premium for unemployed people. We are afraid that that implies the basic level of income support will continue to be paid even to the long-term unemployed, despite the pressure that had been exerted on the Government to make them eligible for the long-term rate of supplementary benefit under the old scheme. An unemployed couple would receive another £12 or so a week and an unemployed single person would receive another £8 a week. That existed as a long-term rate only because of the recognition by Governments of all political colours that after a year it is not possible to survive on the levels of income offered by the old short-term rate. The Government argued that they could not afford to give such an increase to the long-term unemployed, despite evidence in every year's uprating and Budget that they could find that money. They diverted it elsewhere in the tax and benefits system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unemployed will clearly get at best only an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>797</span>
income of the same order of magnitude as they previously received as a basic income. In October 1987 when the actual rates of income support came to be paid, they looked quite different from the illustrative rates; to the untrained eye they looked rather more generous. There was a simple reason for that which Ministers have never explicitly admitted. Reference was made earlier to the Government's tacit admission that our argument was correct. My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) challenged the Secretary of State to say which of two explanations were correct and, extremely reluctantly and grudgingly, he nodded his assent to one of the proposals which I propose to set out this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between presenting their illustrative figures in 1985 and October 1987 when the actual figures were announced, the Government were forced to concede the principle that people on income support should get some compensation for having to pay 20 per cent of their rates. The Social Security
Advisory Committee, and probably the Seclect Committee too, had been extremely critical of the fact that those who received full compensation for their housing costs because they were on the minimum level of benefit income would no longer receive full compensation under the new system. They would receive 100 per cent of their rent but only 80 per cent compensation for their rates because the Prime Minister had taken it into her head that that would in some way make them more responsive to local democratic procedures, or at least serve them right for being so uncuccessful as to be dependent on benefit. That is no quite how the Prime Minister put, but the message was fairly clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When uprating statement was made in October 1987 the amount of compensation that was included in the income support rate for 20 per cent of rates was £1.30 per week. That was for couples, lone parents and single people aged 25 and over, and £1 was included for those aged under 25. Obviously there was an argument at the time about whether £1.30 was adequate compensation for average ratepayers. As the figure is now about £1.80 or £1.90, that sum was clearly inadequate. What made it even more inadequate was that because the Government had not originally intended to pay that amount, it had not been allowed for in the costing of the income support scheme. Equivalent cuts had to be made to claw back at least half the costs. That cost some £300 million, of which the Government clawed back £150 million directly from the rates of income support. The housing benefit figures show where the other half came from. The Government paid the extra compensation, which they had been forced to concede, and then increased the rent rebate taper from the 60 per cent proposed in the technical annex to 65 per cent. They also cut the adult rate of income support by 50p per head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government initially proposed a 60 per cent rent taper—the amount of money withdrawn per pound as one's income increases above the threshold for housing benefit—it was widely argued that a withdrawal of income of 80p in the pound when taking account of the rent and rates taper would be extremely
	<span class='label label-info column'>798</span>
harsh. The Government then increased the rent taper from 60 per cent to 65 per cent, thereby making an income withdrawal under the housing benefit scheme of 85p in the pound. That is how the Government clawed back half of the increase that they had been forced to concede for people paying 20 per cent of their rates. The other half—£150 million—came from the 50p per head cut in the adult rates of income support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have never explicitly admitted—
	<i>Hansard</i> can record only our description of the Secretary of State's nod of the head—that such a cut has been made, but the figures are undeniable. The technical annex shows the rate for a single person over the age of 25 as being £30.60. The index used in the 1986–88 upratings, which is known as the Rossi index and excludes housing costs, gives a figures of £32.60. When we add the £1.30 compensation for the 20 per cent rates contribution, which the Government said they had added, the rate should have been £33.90 but was only £33.40.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar calculation for the 18–24 age-group shows that the income support rate should have been £26.55 but was £26.05—again, 50p less. The rate for couples was £51.45 instead of the £52.45—£1 a week or 50p a head less. Although those under the age of 18 were entitled to benefit at that stage, they got no compensation for rates contribution. That shows that the income support rates in 1988 were precisely as they should have been on the basis of the 1985 illustrative figures, uprated in line with the Rossi index. Therefore, to pay for the compensation that they had been forced to concede to income support claimants to meet 20 per cent of their rates, the Government took 50p per head away from them. They did not rob Peter to pay Paul, but robbed Peter to pay Peter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of November last year, I asked the Government what would be the additional cost of increasing the income support personal allowances to the illustrative rates in the technical annex, uprated to take account of changes in the Rossi price index for the relevant periods and increased in respect of the 20 per cent community charge contribution. I also asked what the personal allowance would then be. I received one of those helpful answers that one occasionally gets from the Department. The Under-Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The personal allowances are set in the context of the overall rates of income support, including the rates of children's allowances and the various premiums. It would therefore not be meaningful to recalculate one element of the illustrative figures in the technical annex."—
	<i>[Official Report,</i> 28 November 1988; Vol. 142, c.940.]</p></blockquote>
We argue that it would be meaningful to make that calculation. That is undoubtedly why the Government did not give it at that stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From this April, the £1 and £1.30 compensation for the rates contribution will be replaced by compensation at £1.15 a head for the 20 per cent of poll tax that claimants will have to pay. That is also a fiction, because 50p of that was inevitably clawed back on the same basis in April 1988. Again, the amount that people on income support will get as compensation for the community charge is not £1.15, but 65p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 173 would ensure—more transparency—a word that the Government sometimes like—in future about the way that calculations are

made. His comments last week show that the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce) clearly believes the myths propagated by the Government that all people on benefit will be better off. It will be easier to convince the hon. Gentleman that that is not so if I produce figures about the level of income paid that are dearer than those behind which the Government shelter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason why Governments should not come clean about what they do—I took that view in Government and I take it in Opposition. Presumably, Governments think that their actions are right, or they would behave differently. Therefore, Governments should state their position clearly and be prepared to defend what they are doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is backward looking. It would mean going back to figures published in 1985, which were based on data collected in 1983. The amendment would force us to suspend the political and social judgments that Governments must make about the level of benefits year by year, and would bind us to out-of-date concepts and figures. That would be extraordinary. I cannot recommend that the Committee accepts this reactionary amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) said, the figures set out in the technical annex were illustrative, and were designed to show the framework and structure of the new system that eventually came into operation in April 1988, rather than to give specific figures on which calculations about level of benefit would be made. The hon. Lady may be right to say that various impressions were created at that time. My mind was on other things then, and I cannot vouch for any impression that she may have gained from what predecessors may have said. I reiterate that this was intended simply to illustrate the framework and structure that would eventually be introduced. It would not benefit the Committee to follow the line suggested by the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we introduced the new benefit system, we made judgments about concentrating more help on those facing the greatest pressure in society, such as families on low incomes or income support, and disabled people. Governments must always balance, and make judgments between, the interests of taxpayers, who provide money for benefits, and of claimants. When we decided on appropriate levels of benefit in April 1988, we made just such a judgment. The hon. Lady has done her mathematics and she may feel that the figures speak for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since April 1988, we have already provided an extra £70 million through increases in the children's allowances, over and above the increase due to normal uprating. From October, there will be an extra £200 million to help elderly and disabled pensioners on income support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are determined to ensure that our benefit system protects the most vulnerable members of society, in 1988,1989, 1990 and beyond. We do not want to look back to data collected in 1983 and bind ourselves to that. We regret the Labour party's obsession with the past, but we understand that the future looks even more unattractive to it, so I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a very good line; most ingenious and inventive. I am a little surprised that the Minister is quite so scathing. Since I returned to the House in 1983, I have been waiting to hear Ministers who are asked about a problem defend the record of their Government instead of talking about what happened under the previous Labour Government. Is the Minister now telling us that referring to 1985 is backward looking and out of date? If so, that is a welcome step. I distinctly recall the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Greenway) a year or so ago referring to the crimes of the Labour Government of 1947.1 thought that that was going too far, but he was very excited about it and obviously his memory goes back a little further than mine. If the Government are at last going to talk about their own record over the past 10 years, it was worth moving the amendment on those grounds alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke of being forced to suspend political and social judgments. We are not calling for that in the amendment, even though we would question much of what the Minister said about those judgments focussing help. I presume that he was referring to family credit and so on. We need the amendment because we have another example of Government double-speak—or Department-speak as my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West would say. The Minister referred to the extra £70 million that was provided for child allowances. That £70 million was provided out of the £180 million or more that was saved by not increasing child benefit. It was not an extra £70 million at all; it was a small part of the money that was saved that the Department managed to claw back from the greedy hands of the Treasury. So there was not extra but less money for all families with children. However, at least the Department of Social Security managed to win a little for its rates of child allowance—no doubt only because it provided an excuse for the original saving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also referred to the extra £200 million for the elderly and disabled pensioners—which they will finally get this autumn, some year or 18 months after the Government made the earth-shattering discovery of their existence. That is the payment to which my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West has alreasy referred—the Lawson embarrassment bonus, which the Government were forced hurriedly to concoct not because they were suddenly struck all of a heap by the plight of elderly and disabled pensioners but because the Chancellor was so tactless as to suggest means testing the Christmas bonus or some of the benefits that the Government were not forced by law to uprate in such clear terms that even the lobby understood them. That was the Chancellor's basic mistake. If he had wrapped up the suggestion in the Government's normal way, the lobby probably would not have understood what he meant. However, even the lobby understands the Christmas bonus, whatever else it fails to understand. Consequently, it realised all too clearly what the Chancellor was saying and the Government had hastily to invent the scheme which, of course, we welcomed. We continue to welcome it, but it is a pity
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>801</span>
that the money goes to only half the pensioners over 70 who receive income support. It could be rather better targeted, but small mercies should be welcomed even while one recognises their size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concentrated on the basic level of income support because that is where the cuts most clearly fell, as the arithmetic shows. Nevertheless, there is the minor matter of the abolition of single payments for the unemployed and their replacement by the social fund, of which the grant element was about 25 per cent of what it had been previously. That is 25 per cent of the reduced level of single payments still being paid after the Government's major cuts announced on the Royal wedding day in 1986, with the timing with which they are so skilled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from that, it would be wrong for us to leave the amendment without another attempt at getting the Minister to acknowledge that—although he may consider it to be backward looking to look back as long ago as two or three years—he has no quarrel with the arithmetic that I set out this morning. Surely he is not suggesting that that was an inaccurate portrayal of the matter. The illustrative figures compared with the actual figures in payment show that the Government did not fully uprate the illustrative figures in line with inflation. To use the Minister's words, that is the Government's political and social judgment. They had every right to make it—that is what Governments are paid for—but it would be nice if they had the guts to stand up and say so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady reads the words that I used in my earlier remarks, she will have a clear explanation of my view on the matter. She has done her sums. These are not new sums, but sums that became clear as a result of some parliamentary questions that were answered last year, and the Government have not sought to conceal them. We decided that the right balance between the interest of the taxpayers, and claimants in April 1988 justified the level of benefits that we then introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the decision to place extra emphasis on those on low pay, in particular those with families with children, was a correct social judgment to make at that time, and we stand by it. However, we have allocated extra resources since then to help both the elderly and disabled and children in families with income support. That shows our concern for the most vulnerable in our society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the fact that, in this clause the Government are correcting a mistake in the award of reduced earnings allowance. However, for
	<span class='label label-info column'>802</span>
the sake of those who have lost out over recent years through the Government's activities, it should go on record that once again, the Government are saving money at the expense of the disabled. First, they froze reduced earnings allowance for those who reach retirement age. Then, last year, they decided to remove reduced earnings allowance and replace it by retirement allowance, which, rather than being merely a rose by any other name, was 25 per cent of a rose under a new name, or 25 per cent of what had previously been paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From memory, the large majority—more than 50 per cent—of those who were at the time receiving reduced earnings allowance, were receiving it at the maximum rate. The effect of the Government's changes last year was that most of those who reached retirement would lose about £19 in income per week. The Government feel strongly about such sums when taken from people in tax, but clearly feel people on benefits can lose without it being a matter of much concern. Such is the level of interest in such matters in our news media that they never notice what is happening until an individual who suffers a loss jumps up and down asking why it happened to him. We are glad that any mistakes will be corrected, but we regret that it will in no way make up for the savings that the Government have already made at the expense of this vulnerable group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendments are concerned with the administration of local DSS offices and the appeal system. Although it could be suggested that I am arguing for a London position, that is not the case. There is a need to maintain an efficient local DSS office in every part of the country. At present the Government have proposed the closure of a large number of local offices in London and the transfer of much of their work to other parts of the country. I do not want it to be thought that this is merely London pleading for some special consideration. The hon. Member for Greenwich (Mrs. Barnes) and I are the only London Opposition Mem-bersf of Parliament on the Committee. I do not know what has happened to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood): perhaps he has fallen foul of some dispute between the SLD and the SDP. Opposition Members well understand that if the Department gets away with this major reorganisation of social security in London by removing local offices and back-up facilities and replacing them with shop-front facilities, the same could happen in other parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent Islington, North which is an inner-city constituency. We deal with three DSS offices: Areola Street in Hackney and the Highgate and Finsbury offices which are both in Archway tower. I see that building looming down upon me every morning when I go out into my back garden to feed my chickens; my rural idyll is overshadowed by Archway tower.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The environmental health office is very happy with my salmonella-free chickens. They are the healthiest chickens around. I had two eggs from them this morning and I am obviously in splendid health as a result. If I keel over during my speech, my last request is that the wretch who sold me the feed for the chickens is investigated, not the chickens themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 16 January I received a charming letter from the Under-Secretary. Although it begins "Dear Jeremy" and ends "Yours, Peter", I object to the parts in between. I am sure that the Under-Secretary did not mean to distress me and hope that he remembers sending the letter. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On 23rd June, we published the report "The Business of Service' about how we should run our network of local Social Security offices so as to provide a better service to the public."</p></blockquote>
I was delighted to read that first sentence. I thought that at last the Minister had accepted that the service to the public had to be improved. As I went out to feed my chickens that morning I looked up at the Archway tower and thought how awful the service to the public is there. I am not being discourteous to the staff of there, as I know many of them, and they are dedicated, hard-working people. The problem is that the building is inappropriate as a social security office. It is a tower block in which the lower floors contain one local office while the upper floors contain another. It is not owned by the Department but is on a long-term lease from somebody else. A dispute about who should clean the windows, which has lasted 15 years, has finally been resolved and the windows have been cleaned. The staff can now see daylight and the Department can save money by turning off the lights during the day. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>804</span>
building also suffers from asbestos on every floor, in every pore and every door. Yellow stickers all over the place warn people not to pick holes as there is asbestos underneath. Asbestos has been removed from the public areas because the vandalism problem meant that asbestos could have escaped into it. No one would say that the Archway tower is an ideal local office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not pleading for the Archway tower but for a quality of service and backup. On that subject, the Minister's letter was disappointing. It says that the Government
	<br><blockquote><p>"commissioned the report because inproving the service we give the public is one of our key objectives. Two important initiatives are, in fact, already in place which will bring big improvements. We have successfully introduced the new Benefit system"—</p></blockquote>
we would question that, having sat through the previous Social Security Committee—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and we are embarked on the Operational Strategy, an ambitious programme of computerisation which will provide rebust and efficient systems."</p></blockquote>
The letter goes on to say that the Government were considering
	<br><blockquote><p>"relocating some work from some of our London officers, in at least one of which you have a constituency interest."</p></blockquote>
It then goes through those plans and says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a detailed timetable is attached. Over that period, the work which does not need face-to-face contract with the public will be moved from London to three Social Security Centres located in Glasgow, Belfast and Wigan. This means that we shall be taking work to parts of the United Kingdom where it will make a major contribution to our stated policy of regional development."</p></blockquote>
As far as I am aware, no Labour Member with a London constituency and no one in the Labour movement in London is opposed to the removal of some Civil Service jobs from London. We are not opposed to decentralisation of central Government facilities, such as the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre's move to Swansea and the Royal Mint's move to Llantrisant. However, we are opposed to damaging local services and local facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that, while these offices will be relocated to Belfast, Glasgow or Wigan, face-to-face contact with the public will be maintained by means of the equivalent of local shop-front offices with several staff to deal with callers. However, that is unlikely to happen as the Minister envisages because most of the work will be done elsewhere and that will create many problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, if something goes wrong with someone's claim, the majority of the work is handled within the departmental office. I am talking not just about my local office but about offices in Lewisham, Brixton, Neasden, Chelsea, Camberwell, Crystal Palace and all the other London offices that are due for closure. Much of the preparation for pension books and other back-up work is done within the local offices and if something goes wrong, the counter staff can chase it up within that office. Problems can sometimes be resolved the same day and the staff can satisfy the claimant and pass on the information or new book. That will not be so simple if they have to telephone or fax Belfast, Glasgow or Wigan—or wherever the work has to be done—and the information must then be transmitted back. We are concerned about a reliance on high technology which could break down or malfunction.

	<span class='label label-info column'>805</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a question of the number of jobs involved and the local contact which goes with that. The Central London Social Security Advisors Forum has produced an excellent user guide to all London DSS offices. It is useful because it describes where the offices are, explains much of the language that is used and contains information about extensions, names of managers and telephone numbers. There is also an interesting section on the page facing the description of each office on the number of languages spoken by staff willing and able to interpret. That is an important feature in London offices. I regret that the Department does not provide more and better translation facilities. I have raised that matter before with the Minister and I know that he is sympathetic and understands my point and that there are proposals for some translation machines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guide states that staff from the Highgate office will translate a number of languages when a claimant has a difficulty. They are not paid for it; it is a voluntary activity. In the Highgate office there are facilities for Arabic, Armenian, Bengali, French, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Italian, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Tamil, Urdu and various Indian and Nigerian dialects. In the Finsbury Park office—which is in the same building—the languages are Bengali, Cantonese, German, Greek, Gujurati, Hindi, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, Tamil and Urdu. That covers most of the languages that are spoken within the local community, although sadly there is no one able to translate Turkish in the office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a major problem if the Department adopts the shop front solution to its problems rather than dealing with the serious problem of staff turnover and morale in inner city offices. If the Minister visited the offices, he would see the long queues of people, the lack of changing facilities for people bringing in small children, the basically poor standard of waiting room accommodation, the inadequate toilet facilities and so on. Those features are not exclusive to the office that I have been talking about; they are common to other offices. We want decent offices that are local and able to provide a service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From 1982 onwards my local authority, the borough of Islington, was worried about the centralisation of its services and the feeling of distance between the people and the local authority providing services. So at some cost and with some difficulty, much patience and hard negotiation with staff, the council diversified its services into 24 local offices. A full range of council services is offered in every one of those offices. They are very successful. The offices are well used, they are part of the community and the problems are well understood. Likewise, the council is better able to understand what is going on in those communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the DSS moves to a remote decentralisation, it will be the very opposite of the decentralisation that I understand of bringing services closer to the community; it will take them further away and make them extremely remote. At present, if someone who speaks only Gujarati goes to the local office at Finsbury Park, a member of staff can be found from elsewhere in the building to undertake a translation. It is unlikely that it
	<span class='label label-info column'>806</span>
would be possible to telephone the Glasgow office and have someone translate over the telephone into Gujarati. It is even more unlikely in the case of Belfast. So the whole system would become even more user unfriendly than it is now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Additionally, I understand that the Department proposes to install public telephones. Staff will tell the claimants that there is a public telephone and they would then be able to telephone Glasgow for the price of a local call through the miracle of British Telecom or Mercury. There will be one public telephone in each office. That is a ludicrously inadequate provision and considerable frustration will build up. I hope that the Minister will recognise the force of our argument about the provision of local offices and local services and understand why we have tabled the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall mention only a few further points, because we are anxious to make progress. The report was primarily aimed at cutting costs by the closure of the offices. Although it is true that it is difficult to recruit and retain staff in the London offices, there is not just a problem of pay. A substantial improvement in accommodation, improved training and better staff levels would help to make life more tolerable for people who work in the Department of Social Security. They are easy people to knock, but they have difficult job. The people who come to the offices are often desperate and the staff have to explain how they can resolve their various benefit problems and tell them what they are and are not entitled to. If the offices are short of staff, with the telephone ringing all the time, constant pressure and long queues, the job becomes more and more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of Parliament have a slight inkling of that sometimes when we hold our surgeries and we have seen about 10 people and are already feeling fairly tired but realise that there are 30 or 40 more still to see. We begin to think, "God, how long is this going to go on? Are we going to be here all night?" I sometimes feel that when I am still seeing people in my surgery at about 11 o'clock on a Friday night. That happens to us just one evening a week; it is the lot of someone working behind a social security counter every day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, staffing levels are crucial and if they are not improved, what happens is that with the best will in the world there is a brutalisation among staff. If they are constantly under pressure and sense that people feel aggrieved and aggravated towards them, their attitudes become entrenched and poor relationships develop as a result. So the unions are correct in saying that the proposed staffing level of 15 to 20 staff per local office is far too low to cope with the caller traffic, including social fund matters, and that the new system will prove frustrating and unsatisfactory for staff and claimants alike. Staff morale is likely to be lower as a result of the proposals, not higher, and we shall have a far worse service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost savings are interesting. When the Moodie report was published, the Department claimed that it wanted to improve the quality of—
	<i>[Interuption].</i> I am glad that I am having such an impact on the Civil Service; I have never felt so powerful in my life. The Moodie report claimed that it wanted to improve the quality of service to all users of Department of Social Security offices. That is fine. The Department's res-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>807</span>
ponse is the opposite: it is to save a great deal of money. By moving offices out of London the Department is saving on the cost of London weighting, high rents and expensive buildings. It is also breaking up the unity of each office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Face-to-face contact will be lost and the first and only point of contact will be the shop front. We are concerned about the loss of translation facilities, the impracticality of sophisticated telephone and telex services working properly the whole time and the appalling way in which the public will be treated. I foresee a bunker mentality developing in the Department. There will be a local office with 15 or 20 staff. That is not a big local office; it will be a bit like a bank but without the staff. There will be large glass screens between the public and the benefit staff and there will be one telephone in a booth in the corner where people will queue up to telephone Wigan, Belfast or Glasgow. That is an inefficient and incompetent way of running a local office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is proposed for London, partly because of office costs and the need to pay London weighting. Understaffing causes problems in retaining staff. There is now virtually a ban on recruiting in all those offices scheduled for closure. Therefore, there is even greater loss of staff morale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in London realise that one way to get their benefit problems sorted out is to go to their Member of Parliament. The Member of Parliament writes to the manager, who gives high priority to replying to queries from hon. Members, so claimants get a reply because they have spoken to a Member of Parliament. That is not a satisfactory or efficient way to run a service.

It is not only Opposition Members who are affected by office closures. I am but it also affects the hon. Members for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman), for Brox-bourne (Mrs. Roe), for Chelmsford (Mr. Burns), for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall), for Norfolk, Southwest (Mrs. Shephard) and for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson). Those hon. Members are all members of the Committee. They are not all here, but they are all affected. I hope that they will think about that when deciding what will happen to the amendments. The area covered by the London south office includes the constituencies of the hon. Members for Chelsea (Mr. Scott), for Fareham (Mr. Lloyd) and for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire). The Minister has a direct interest. Few Opposition Members, but many Conservative Members, are affected. I am sure that they will agree about the importance of accepting the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Amendment No. 174 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In deciding for the purposes of subsection (1) above whether it is practicable to dispose of a claim within 14 days, no account shall be taken of any matters which are not directly relevant to the determination of the claim'".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 175 deals with appeals and says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if his appeal is received at an office of the Department of Social Security it shall be sent to the clerk of the tribunal with the submissions of an adjudication officer on the appeal within fifteen working days".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 176 would require notification of social security appeal tribunals to be given within seven days. The Department must not be allowed to claim administrative difficulties, understaffing or communication problems as reason for lack of response to claims or appeals. The amendments deal with administration and local offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Social Security Act 1975, claims for family credit and income support are referred to an adjudication officer for a decision. Once referred, those should be dealt with in 14 days "so far as practicable". The meaning of that phrase has been subject to legal scrutiny. The Child Poverty Action Group and others have argued that adjudication officers must take a claim into consideration, and, in the absence of anything emerging from the claim that requiries further investigation, it must be disposed of within 14 days. However, the DSS argued that extrinsic factors were relevant to the determination of what is reasonably practicable. The judgment of Regina v. Secretary of State for Social Services ex parte CPAG and others, said
	<br><blockquote><p>"The language of section 98(i) and section 99(i) of the 1975 Act make it clear that it was intended by Parliament that claims for benefit should be dealt with expeditiously".</p></blockquote>
Moreover, the court considered that the requirement for speedy disposal of claims was a factor that the Secretary of State had to take into account when considering the number of adjudication officers to appoint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was judged to be an insufficient number of staff to deal with benefit claims was one of the key issues that led to the case being brought. Lord Justice Woolf, who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, stated that the Secretary of State:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0469">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>809</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"has a discretion as to the number of adjudication officers who he should appoint and this is a discretion to be exercised reasonably, taking into account the legislative scheme requiring the expeditious disposal of claims within 14 days where this is practicable."</p></blockquote>
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report by the National Audit Office on the quality of service to the public at local DSS offices contained a detailed passage about delays in the determination of claims, and I shall give some examples shortly. Perhaps partly as a result of that report, and the subsequent report by the Select Committee on Public Accounts, more attention appears to have been paid recently to the quality of service, including delays in payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the Secretary of State, in his speech to the Conservative party conference on 12 October 1988, and the Minister for Social Security in a DSS press release, in August 1988, emphasised the importance that they attach to improvements in the service provided to the public. The DSS national performance targets, including clearance times for claims, were set out in chapter 15 of the Government's expenditure plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The performance targets for income support—the clearance time in working days—averaged 5 days from 1 July with an error rate of 10 per cent. Family credit averaged 18 days. Retirement pensions, regional organisation, took 26 days, and 90 per cent of claims reserved to the central pensions branch were dealt with in 30 days. Invalidity benefit was dealt with in 10 days and invalid care allowance averaged 60 days. War pensions were dealt with, on average, in 25 weeks. Those are pretty far away from the suggested 14 days. Only maternity benefit is dealt with in an average of 14 days. Appeals are on average dealt with in 22 days. The North Fylde central office dealt with attendance and mobility allowances in 40 days on average.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must deal with those serious problems, and I am not convinced that the closure of back-up facilities of local offices and the centralisation of administration does that. Delays are likely to get worse rather than better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The North Flyde office deals with pensions and is a national facility. Only some pension book printing and determination of pensions is done locally. Most is handled nationally. There are long delays. Will the performance of the national pensions office be repeated in every other social security sector when local offices are closed and administration transferred? That is a serious question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want local offices, staff and back up. Local staff have an understanding of the area. They aim to do the translation work when that is needed. They are likely to understand the environment in which they live and work. They are far better equipped to do the work than someone who, with the best will in the world, is merely passing paper across his or her desk in Glasgow, Wigan or Belfast, for someone else, somewhere in London. That is not a sensible way to run a local service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Audit Office commissioned a Gallup survey on staff attributes which found that 57 per cent thought that the staff were helpful and 31 per cent
	<span class='label label-info column'>810</span>
thought not. Only 48 per cent thought that staff seemed very knowledgeable. Only 45 per cent thought that staff appeared to have time for them, and 45 per cent disagreed; 64 per cent thought that staff were polite and 22 per cent disagreed. Fifty six per cent agreed that staff were friendly, but 27 per cent disagreed. I do not intend to criticise the staff, but I am pointing out the difficulties under which they are forced to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Individual office average clearance times during the year 1987–88 were as follows. For retirement pensions the best was 14 days and the worst was 57 days. For sickness and maternity benefit the best was six days and the worst was 23 days. For supplementary benefit the best was two and a half days and worst was 15 days. In many parts, the service is not of the required standard. That will not be improved by closing local offices and back-up facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Appeals tribunals to which amendments Nos. 175 and 176 relate, were referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) when he moved amendment No. 53 to clause 7. He mentioned the general rule laid down by the president of the tribunal, Judge Byrt, that appeals received at local offices should be forwarded by the tribunal clerk within 15 working days and that failure to meet the target should be recorded in the chief adjudication officer's annual report. That report stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I regret…that delays in sending submissions to SSATs have got worse. The average clearance times of submissions to SSATs were 22 working days for supplementary benefit appeals (compared with 18 last year) 26 days for other benefit appeals (compared with 20 last year). The proportions cleared to tribunals within the requisite 15 days were just over and just under half respectively."</p></blockquote>
As days means working days, the 22 days average for delay in supplementary benefit appeals means four and half weeks in reality, including weekends and 26 day delays for other appeals meant over five weeks. That is not the total delay between the lodging of an appeal and tribunal hearing which runs into several months, despite the reduction in the number of appeals in recent months, it is simply the delay that occurs at the first stage of the appeal, even before it is pased on by the local office to the tribunal office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about a number of aspects of the administration of the social security system. It is appropriate that it should be a subject for debate here. Some of the problems of administration of local offices are a result of the last two or three Social Security Acts. I ask the Minister to think seriously about this. The strategy that his Department adopted towards the report that showed enormous dissatisfaction with the administration of the social security system will not provide a solution. It is likely to make matters worse. It is likely to decrease staff morale. It is likely to decrease the number of staff available to deal directly with the public and increase the alienation between the public and the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will recognise that the solution lies in developing genuinely local, fully staffed offices, within communities and with decent facilities. If the Department adopts a more friendly attitude towards claimants it will improve the efficiency of those offices. I feel strongly about this. I deal with many social security matters as a constituency Member

	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the member for Islington, North. My constituency has probably benefitted at least as much as any other by the relocation of jobs. It contains the passport office, the patent office and the business statistics office. We also have the Trustee Savings bank. It is not a Government Department but it relocated many jobs. Many thousands of jobs have been relocated from overheated, overcrowded parts of London and the south east to Newport, West in glorious Gwent to the great joy of the staff who have been transferred and the people there. It is an extremely successful programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The patent office was the subject of an Adjournment debate. A Compromise was made. An appeal was made by the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) who said that not all the jobs should go down there and that a section of the patent office should remain in London. He gave some powerful and persuasive reasons and the case was successful. We are saying much the same here with an even greater intensity of argument. The DSS has such a crucial job to explain the new and vast complexities that the Government have introduced into the system, including, for example, clearing up the present confusion about transitional payments that face-to-face contact with the public is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we are beneficiaries of the system, we are often victims of it too. Like thousands of my constituents, my income tax is being decided in East Kilbride. There are certain language difficulties there. The scope for confusion if someone speaks Gujurati with a Glaswegian accent does not bear thinking about. Although we have these splendid data highways, where communications can come down by computer links, fax links and television links and information can be transferred in a millisecond, certain operations can only be carried out face to face.

My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North—mentioned another firm that was transferred to Llantrissant—the Royal Mint, which happens to be in the constituency of Pontypridd. One of the candidates in the recent by-election was unwise enough to allow his tongue to run away with him and he described the Pontypridd constituency as the hole with the mint in it. The electorate awarded him a lost deposit for that remark. I was intrigued by my hon. Friend's revelation that he is an embryonic chicken farmer. My hon. Friends the Members for Preston (Mrs. Wise) and for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) both rear chickens. They have one special characteristic in the way that they treat their chickens—neither of them ever slaughters a hen. If one visits them one sees that unique sight in

In the last two amendments in the group, we wish to re-emphasise what has been said. We are dealing not with the intentions of the Government and the malevolence that is at the heart of many of their proposals but with the delays in the notification of tribunals and the creaking system. It must be put right. We are not asking for a great deal. Judge Byrt has clearly laid down targets that are not ambitious at all. The system does not work efficiently. There are huge delays before the claimants hear the results of tribunals and delays in almost every part of the system. Claimants want the money now, not in three or four months' time. There is a disincentive to anyone to make a claim if every stage of the process is clogged up with unexplained delays and inefficients. If the Minister does not accept the amendment, can he at least tell us what the Government are doing to ensure that they reach the target laid down by the Judge?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to reply to the debate started by the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn), who dealt with some important points.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: They looked clean this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to undertake to remedy that defect, even though I cannot accept the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nub of the hon. Gentleman's argument was not out of order but illustrated what he thought was wrong. He was worried that our solution would make a reality of the worry that lies behind the amendment. Before I deal with that, I shall take each of the amendments in turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, a claim for benefit must be determined by an adjudication officer within 14 days of its submission to him by the Secretary of State, so far as is practicable. In deciding what is practicable, regard must be had to matters independent of the claim itself,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>813</span>
such as the volume of claims awaiting determination and the numbers of officers available to deal with those claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 174 would be to require an adjudication officer to determine a claim for benefit within 14 days of its being submitted to him by the Secretary of State, unless matters directly relevant to the claim made it impracticable. The Secretary of State would consequently need to employ sufficient adjudication officers to cope with any emergency or unforeseen situation that might arise, in order to comply with this provision. The amendment therefore breaches an important principle, namely that legislation must not impose a duty where, by its very nature, it is impossible to comply with that duty in circumstances that are out of the Secretary of State's control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a misuse of public funds if the number of adjudication officers to be appointed by the Secretary of State was dictated by the largest conceivable number of claims which could arise for consideration at any one time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's point, but is he aware that in many other areas of legislation, such as employment law and industrial tribunals, there are specific time limits of three months or less, by which time an application must be made by either party to have the matter dealt with by a tribunal. If, for good reason, either party is unable to meet the deadline, he must apply to the tribunal for deferment of the hearing or application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to impose a legal requirement on the Department to deal with a claim within that time. If it cannot do so, it must explain why and apply to a due process to have that explanation accepted. By not having such a requirement, the Department can get away with neglecting claims for a long time, unless individuals or Member of Parliament object. A time limit would become a discipline on the running of the Department, which I am sure the Minister would welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a discipline for the Department because it is already an objective. The objective is met much more frequently than the hon. Members for Islington, North and for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) will admit. The adjudication officer deals with the majority of claims for income support within 14 days and the average time taken is four or five days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During his speech, the hon. Member for Islington, North blamed recent legislation for increasing difficulties, but by introducing a system that replaces supplementary benefit, the Social Security Act 1986 has speeded up the adjudication process. In most offices, claims for an important benefit such as income support can be settled quickly, as they imply that the individual has insufficient money to live on. Settlement is well within the target and has been speeded up in the past year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister say that the average time taken for a claim to be settled is now four or five days? If that is so, it is a substantial improvement.
	<span class='label label-info column'>814</span>
Under the old system in 1986–87, the average time taken was 21 days, although we recognise that that included a range of between five and 62 days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The period to which the hon. Lady refers is before my time. In most offices the process now works quickly and takes, on average, four or five days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendments were written into the Bill without the qualification "as far as is practicable", thousands of extra staff would have to be recruited and trained to cope with peaks in demand. That would not be a good use of public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are committed to matching staff complements to workloads. The complementing system, which the Department now uses, can deal with seasonal fluctuations and also unforeseen work such as may be caused by a large-scale industrial dispute, emergency or disaster. In addition, where there are sudden and unexpected increases in claims, extra teams of staff are brought in from outside the office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, North referred to the plans for London. My letter to him explained that we are making those changes because London is an area in which claims are not processed as quickly and accurately as we should like. The change is designed to provide a better service to claimants. We aim to move out of London the work that can be and is done in the back room, so that those directly serving the customer have more up-to-date information than at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is sceptical about whether that can work. Although the hon. Member for Newport, West conceded that there have been some advances in information technology, he, too, does not believe that our plan will work. Information technology makes it possible to communicate information to the member of staff dealing with the claimant that has been processed in Wigan, Belfast or Glasgow as rapidly as if it had been processed in the room upstairs. We intend to move not jobs but job vacancies out of London—jobs that are difficult to fill or jobs in which it is difficult to retain staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Islington, North and for Newport, West found it difficult to approve the principle of moving Civil Service jobs from London to areas where people need employment. I understand why the hon. Member for Islington, North cannot accept the removal even of potential jobs from within his constituency. We are moving them from his constituency to areas where they can and will be filled and where the work will be done well. For a variety of reasons, it is difficult to recruit staff of sufficient quality in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. He will realise that the objective is to improve the service to his constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was in order for the hon. Gentleman to spend a long time talking about the particular London office because he was worried that his claimants were not getting a proper serive, which is the subject of the amendment. I am glad that he concentrated on London. It enables me to state that we are investing heavily to enable the 14-day deadlines to be met and improved upon in areas where at present that is least likely to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>815</span>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned translation facilities. As he said, we have corresponded on that matter before. It is much in our minds. The reduced pressure on staff who have face-to-face contact with the public will make it possible for them to deal with the problems more energetically and with greater concentration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is also worried about telephones. I do not know where he gets the idea that there will be only one telephone. The member of staff who is dealing with the claim will have the information on a VDU screen which the claimant will be able to see, so almost all matters should be settled immediately. If the claimant wishes or needs to talk to the officer who is processing the information there will be a telephone link, but the telephone will not be in a single booth somewhere in the office, with a queue outside it. When the query cannot be answered directly—I hope and expect that such occasions will be rare—we want to make it possible for direct contact to be established between the claimant and the member of staff who is processing the claim and doing the background work. The member of staff who is dealing with the claim in the office will direct the individual to a booth. The claimant will not have to pay for the call at the local rate; he will be able to speak freely and without charge. It will also be possible for that individual to ring the centre in Glasgow, Wigan or Belfast from home for the cost of a local call.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the layout of the office and how the various elements within it will be grouped, it is too early to be precise, but the object of the exercise is to make it much easier for claimants to obtain and provide information and to have their claims settled much more quickly and accurately than at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening to the Minister with great attention. Will he clarify some points? First, he said that claimants will be able to see the information about their claims on a VDU. Does that mean that there will be an open office and that claimants will go to a particular desk? If so, the approach will be different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister said that it will be possible for someone to make a local-cost call from, say, home if he or she has a telephone—of course, all social security claimants have telephones, but I shall not go into that now—and be connected to the relevant centre. Does that technology exist now, or is it hoped that it will exist in the near future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am assured that the technology exists. Like the hon. Lady, I was interested to know whether it was something that was being developed or whether the link was possible with existing technology. I hope that she receives that news with as much pleasure and satisfaction as I did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the access to the screen, I cannot give the hon. Lady an exact picture of the layout of the office. I envisage the screen being there for the member of staff who deals with the applicant's claim. It will simply be a matter of the claimant leaning round, or of the VDU being swivelled round for the claimant to see. There will be no secret about what is on the screen; it will hold the information that the claimant had provided. That will be a great improvement on what is now available in
	<span class='label label-info column'>816</span>
terms of easy and ready access to information in most offices, let alone the offices in London about which we were talking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) mentioned the length of time that it takes to process retirement pensions at Newcastle. They are dealt with on average within 22 days and the claims are normally made well in advance so they are well and truly settled by the time that the individual becomes eligible for a retirement pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although there has been a great improvement in the time scale within which income support is processed, we are not happy with the length of time that it takes to process a number of other benefits. It is not practical to make a hard and fast rule as suggested by the amendment. In rejecting it, I would not like the Committee to think that we are either satisfied with the time scale for a number of benefits or that the Department is not using its energies to bring about an improvement. It is in that spirit that I say no to amendment No. 174. It imposes a duty on the Secretary of State with which it is almost impossible to comply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 175 has a similar effect. It would require adjudication officers to prepare and send their written submissions on appeals to tribunal clerks within 15 working days of the appeal being lodged. The Secretary of State would consequently need to employ sufficient adjudication officers to cope with any emergency or unforeseen situation which might arise, in order to comply with that provision. There is currently no statutory time limit within which adjudication officers have to make their written submissions on appeals. In practice, the time taken often depends on how long it takes for further investigations to be made on matters raised by the appeal, as well as the complexity of the case and the number of adjudication officers available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a yardstick, the president of social security appeals tribunals has instructed his tribunal clerks to check with adjudication officers if submissions have not been received within 15 working days of the appeal being lodged, and the Department does its best to comply with that time limit. For example, our figures show that the national average clearance times for income support appeals from local offices to tribunals are running at about 18 working days. Our objective is to move towards clearing appeals within 15 working days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another amendment that would impose an absolute duty on the Secretary of State he would find it virtually impossible to comply with, since he would need to ensure that there were sufficient adjudication officers to deal with any unforeseen situations. In many cases, even if he had all the officers to meet any type of emergency, there would remain problems in collecting the information that is needed for some of the more complex appeals. The Government will ask the Committee to reject the amendment if it is pressed, but our objective is to improve on the 18 days that is the average now, and our current target is 15 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 176 imposes an absolute target—a seven calendar day limit—within which social security
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

appeals tribunal clerks would be required to notify claimants of the decision on their appeal reached by the tribunal. In effect, to comply with the provisions in the amendment, the president of the social security appeal tribunals would need to ensure that there were sufficient tribunal clerks to cope with any emergency or unforeseen situation that might arise. At present, regulations require that a copy of the record of the tribunal's decision be sent to the claimant as soon as practicable after a case has been decided by an appeal tribunal. As the issuing of decision notices is an administrative matter for the president, we sought his views on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that social security appeal tribunals continue to suffer from the clearing of arrears in the aftermath of the supplementary benefit single payment cases, and that will continue until about the end of March this year. Currently, the position is as follows: 29 per cent. decisions are issued within five working days; 66 per cent of available decisions are issued within 10 working days, 91 per cent within 15 working days and 99 per cent within 20 working days. The president describes the current position as totally unacceptable. His target is that 95 per cent of all decisions should be issued within 10 working days to be achieved by the end of May 1989. However, he considers it impracticable to set a target of 100 per cent of cases within five working days, which is the aim of the amendment. He says that not all tribunals are held in administrative centres and clerks have to post decisions at the close of business. Those then have to be typed and issued by the centres. A turnaround of five days would rely on a 24 hour turnaround on typing or the abandonment of typing completely, but the president feels that it is right to maintain the standard of service in this respect by always issuing typed decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 176 also imposes an absolute duty on the president that he would find it virtually impossible to comply with, as he would need to ensure that there were sufficient tribunal clerks to deal with unforeseen situations. Moreover in some centres where tribunals meet there are no typing or clerical facilities for them to use. For that reason, the Government cannot accept the amendment as it stands, because it is in an absolute form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent comparison between the demands made on hon. Members by the Home Office and the attitude that DSS Ministers take towards claimants. Is she aware that for one awful period of several months those of us dealing with cases from Sri Lanka had to make representations of a detailed legal nature within 24 hours of putting the first stop on the removal of that person? It caused havoc in my office, and I had to have six volunteers to help me deal with the caseload.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am aware of that problem. I should perhaps emphasise that the Home Office does not meet these deadlines itself when it replies to hon. Members. That is a little by the by, but with luck it will be extremely useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth considering for a moment longer the observations made by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) about how speedily the DSS handles queries and how speedily it may be able to deal with them in future, in particular on a pilot basis. I understand that if the scheme proposed for the London offices is successful, the Government intend to extend it but we do not quite know how the Department will measure success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us that the goal is to improve the service to customers. We all want to see that. That is why, as my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North, was at pains to make clear, we are not opposed to the setting up of centres or the more efficient handling of business. We are worried because while the Department says that it wants to use new technology to improve the service to customers, running throughout the implementation of its policy has been a wish to recoup the costs of introducing that new technology. We fear that the net effect will be not to improve but to reduce the service to claimants. A strong thread seems to be the wish to save money on administration, which is understandable but not desirable if it reduces what the Minister himself has conceded is already too low a standard of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one exception to the rule that the Department is always seeking to improve efficiency and reduce costs. For reasons of dogma, the Department prefers to use private companies to install the microcomputers in local offices and has thus spent substantially more that it would have done had it been prepared to do that in-house. The Government argue that that using private companies is more efficient and cost effective, even when it is shown to have cost substantially more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he believes that the telephone links that will reliably enable someone to make a local call and to be put through to the centre handling their claim have been developed and are in use. That brings me to one of my main concerns. I understand that the Government intend that claims will be dealt with at the centre and that claims wil be dealt with either by post or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>819</span>
on the telephone. It is intended to move away from the idea that people who have problems with claims should go to the local office. The Government are intent on moving people on to a reliance on postal and telephone claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a cause for some alarm, particulary when we are talking about the payment of people's basic income. Many people are not as literate as the Department assumes. Even more of them who are living on social security benefits do not have telephone in their homes and fewer will have one if the Department continues not to increase benefits. We are greatly concerned that the thrust of the Department's policy is towards making the handling of claims will be remote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that using computer technology will make no difference. The information on the claimant will be just as accessible down the phone line from the computer as it is now when the records are perhaps stored in the next room. Obviously we all hope that is so and doubtless it will be so in many cases. We all hope that that is, and will be so in may cases, but that leaves no room for error. The remoteness of centres will cause serious difficulties if a claim is mislaid, misfiled or misrecorded. That is apart from linguistic difficulties, about which my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North spoke so well, which will increase if offices are moved from the London area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I saw with horror this morning that the new, up-to-date, all-singing, all-dancing DSS under the glamorous Secretary of State will consider smart cards for the payment of benefit. I do not wish the DSS to be behind the times, and not consider the uses for new technology, but the cards should be widely tested before they are used for basic benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also implications for civil liberties if people are required to carry such cards, because of the information that they will carry, voice printing and so on. The Opposition, like the Government, are interested in the delivery of a better service to the DSS customer. It is shocking that, although our amendments suggest that claims be dealt with within 14 days, that matters should be communicated to tribunals within 15 working days, and that the result of the tribunal appeal should be communicated within seven days, the Minister can tell us only that the Department cannot meet those deadlines. Those deadlines should be the Department's priorities. If existing offices, new centres and new local offices were adequately staffed, we could have a customer-friendly DSS. No one can be friendly to customers when he or she is underpaid, grossly overworked, trying to administer an unjust system and having to explain away failures that he or she cannot remedy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave an awful reply to our reasonable amendments. There should be a decent, efficient service with administrate delays cut to a minimum. The Secretary of State should be required to reply within 14 days. There is nothing unreasonable about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has given me a lot of ideas. In future, I shall not bother to pay my telephone bill within the
	<span class='label label-info column'>820</span>
required time. I shall just say, "Administrative factors prevented me from paying it." I shall do the same with rates and taxes. Of course, the retribution that those bodies could wreak on me would be wonderful. They could cut the phone off and I could get a bit of peace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enought that people who are desperate to get their benefits sorted out, and their claims resolved, have been told by the Minister, "We cannot accept the imposition of such deadlines on claims." On an intervention, I pointed out that the 14-day rule would discipline his Department. If the Department cannot meet that deadline it is its duty to explain why to someone else through a due process. Everyone else has disciplines imposed on them, and claimants must claim within a specific period, so why should not those disciplines be imposed on the Minister and the Department? It is wholly wrong and unjust that they are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Highly sophisticated technology will be used in the new system proposed by the Minister. The Finsbury Park and Highgate offices in the Archway tower deal with the pensions and benefits of 38,000 people in north London. In future, a maximum of 40 staff on counter duty in those offices will deal with all those claims. A sophisticated system of communication will be required so that offices in Glasgow can deal with queries in north London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 37, paragraph 79, of "The Business of Service" report on regional organisation scrutiny—the famous Moodie report—says:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"we commissioned Logica Consultancy Ltd. to carry out a short communications strategy study of the communications requirements of a new network based on our models D, E and F. The study concluded that all the above requirements are possible. However, full integration is dependent on communications networks which use modern digital signalling equipment, and on current projections digital networks are not going to be available on a large enougn scale until 1995. So, for Phase I of the new network, an interim solution, which captures the functionality of integrated digital networking is required. Having explored the (often complex) issues as thoroughly as it was possible in the time scale, the Logica consultants advise us there are a number of options available which are all feasible and deliverable".</p></blockquote>
There is that important caveat at the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will claimants be dealt with in the offices? The Minister said that there will be a nice, user-friendly office to which everyone can come to look at the screen, along with the officer of the Department. Translation is important in my area. According to the previous census, 41 different languages are spoken in my borough. Of the two social security offices that cover the borough, Highgate office can provide translations into only 16 languages, and Finsbury Park into 11. It would be a remarkable luck in recruitment if the 15 to 20 people employed in each office could even offer those 42 languages. Turkish is available in neither office, despite being widely spoken in the community. What will happen if someone who does not speak English comes in with a query? Who will translate if officers cannot speak any language other than English? I suspect that the translation and the claim will not happen, the money will not be paid and a family will suffer. Perhaps the local authority can provide translation facilities to help people out, but it is the Department's responsibility to ensure that people can communicate reasonably with Government facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, we discussed the phone link and people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>821</span>
ringing in. If I missed the Committee, I apologise. I was discussing the idea of the local cost call which could be transferred to Glasgow, Belfast or Wigan. I hope that someone in the office could phone those distant places because many people do not have telephones. That may seem unusual to the Committee, but it is true. As a rule of thumb I always ask people coming to my surgeries if they have a telephone number. It is interesting that roughly a quarter of them do not. They tend to be the poorest people who are having problems with the DSS. The phone link is no help to them if they have to phone Glasgow to resolve their social security problem but they do not have a phone and the public phone has been vandalised. We require local offices to provide local services and to solve the problems of people who come along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that we are being Luddite in preventing the export of jobs or vacancies to the north is wrong. We want to see a decent local service. There are vacancies in local offices because there has been a ban on recruitment, because staff morale is low as a result of under-staffing, threats about privatisation and the awful working conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Ladywood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this not just another reflection of our distorted, divided economy? House prices in London are now so high that people on average or low incomes cannot afford to live here. The services that are normally provided by people on those levels of income must be done far away. Is that not part of the break down of our society and the division between north and south?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms. Short) is absolutely right. My constituency is a classic example: house and flat prices are now way beyond the reach of anyone on an average income. Unless people can live in council or socially-owned property, they have no chance of finding anywhere to live in the borough. I often visit the Archway tower and talk to the staff there. Many new, young members of staff commute enormous distances. They do not want to, as they often have family living in the area. Having left school and obtained a job with the Department of Social Security, they wished to leave home but simply could not afford to live locally, and now have to live a long way away and commute vast distances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recruitment problem is caused partly by housing and house prices and partly by levels of morale in the offices. It is not a solution for the Government to run away from those problems by shifting the resources elsewhere. The solution is to pay people properly, treat them properly, give them decent working conditions and provide a full range of local facilities in those offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is incredible and appalling that the Minister puts on record that the Government are not prepared to accept the requirement of a 14-day ruling. It is offensive to people who are desperate for some benefit. Benefit is not a charity or a gift; it is theirs by right. The Government must get away from the idea that the Department is doing everyone a favour. People who claim have a right to do so. Therefore, it is the Govern-
	<span class='label label-info column'>822</span>
ment's responsibility to ensure that claims are dealt with expeditiously, efficiently and, above all, locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Conservative Members, whose constituents will suffer as a result of these moves, will think again and support our amendments, which will at least require the Secretary of State to provide a decent service locally for all those who are desperate to get help from the Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must challenge the Minister's view of the well-oiled DSS machine moving majestically along. Has the Minister ever tried to phone a DSS office on a public telephone line? If so, he will have been lucky to have got through. In my area, the phone is not answered for long periods during the mornings, almost as a routine. The experience of a computerised Department as detailed by the National Audit Office is a sad story. It is not a miracle of new technology but a system resulting from anticipated savings. Every time a report is issued the expected savings decrease and the cost goes up. It is another catastrophe in the making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's answer revealed a disgraceful situation. Amendment No. 176 simply asks that the claimant be notified of the decision of a tribunal. That is a simple matter requiring a yes or no answer. In the days of Dickens, when the clerks would move great files around, an answer could be given within seven days. Even allowing for postal delays and so on, that could be done now. In the days of new technology, the information could be stored in some computer—we have heard about the messages that will flash between offices in microseconds. Yet it is beyond the wit of most offices to give a simple yes or no decision to people who have already taken their appeal through this constipated system and who are desperate for their money, which has been stopped and may not be paid again. Some may be on a hardship allowance, but many will receive nothing until they have received that final word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the lucky 29 per cent hear within five working days, but for 37 per cent it takes two weeks to get that simple message through the post. A further 25 per cent do not receive an answer for three weeks, and 8 per cent do not receive one for nearly a month. For the unfortunate 1 per cent it takes even longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a disgrace. There is no excuse; it is sheer, grotesque inefficiency. The Government cannot duck out of that. The best way to understand the Government's awful record is to consider the Minister's reply to amendment No. 176.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An answer within seven days is not asking for much. A claimant who has made an appeal may fall into debt—there is no compensation for that—and the arrears may be enormous if the appeal is successful. The Minister cannot defend such a position. It needs urgent action. If he feels that legislation is the inappropriate way to end this continuing disgrace, he must offer an alternative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

use more information technology is not brought about by a desire to save money. On the contrary; the only way in which the Department can improve services to the desired level is to use modern information technology. I am sorry that Opposition Members are either too sceptical about embarking on it or are so wedded to the old way of doing things that they find it difficult to bend their minds towards something new. The suggestion of my hon. Friend the Minister of State that they should look forward a little more is good advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have warned the Minister before that he should try not to be quite so patronising—obviously without success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not feel that it is wrong to use new technology. We object because the Department is criminally wasting an opportunity to improve substantially the service that it could give to customers. It is doing so because, at the same time as introducing new technology, which may offer the basis of an improved service, it is recuperating some of the cost by cutting staff. It is a matter not of looking backwards or forwards but of what will improve the service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The introduction of new technology will mean fewer staff, but the reduction in the number of staff will follow rather than coincide with the introduction of technology and the testing of the system.

How will the introduction of new technology change that? Can the Minister give some assurance about how long people must wait in offices, once the new technology is introduced?

It is already in pilot offices and is working very well because it has benefited from a long period of investment and development. A partnership with outside firms and consultants has enabled us to get the best of what can be supplied from within the Department and also the best of that which can be supplied from outside. The hon. Lady also mentioned smart cards. There is no proposal to introduce them, although I was interested to hear the suggestion on the radio this morning.

The subject of the amendments was not merely service but the speed with which it is supplied. I have accepted that standards are not as they should be in all areas. Some are bad. However, I will not accept the general condemnation by the Opposition that all is quite hopeless and a million light years in every respect from what it should be. The objective for the preparation of appeals to social security appeals tribunals is to get the period down to 15 days. That was the figure in the amendment. The reality is that the average is 18 days. That is not good enough, but it is not the disaster that the Opposition try to pretend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important benefit for those in real need is income support. The time for processing that is well within 14 days, the average being four or five days. Opposition Members seemed rather surprised at that, looked at, stepped by and decided to concentrate on other benefits. That benefit was introduced in its present form—to follow supplementary benefit—as a result of the 1986 Act. It was introduced in April last year. It is one of the areas where the Government have tried to obtain increased efficiency, speed and accuracy. It is clear from the figures that it has worked well. Our objective is to ensure that the same kind of improvements are achieved for the processing of other benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>825</span>
Under current social security legislation, adjudication officers may either decide claims for social security benefits themselves or refer them to social security appeal tribunals for determination. In practice, such references are rare; only a tiny proportion of all claims that are made are referred to social security appeal tribunals for decision. References are usually made where a claimant has appealed to a social security appeal tribunal against an adjudication officer's decision on an initial claim, and subsequent claims for benefit are made which raise the same issues that led to the appeal. The adjudication officer will often not determine those subsequent claims himself but will refer them to the tribunal, so that it can decide all the claims simultaneously. The claimant must, however, be given written notice of the adjudication officer's reference, and the social security commissioners have said that that notice must be given in good time for the claimant to prepare for the tribunal hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only problem is that in the days before the tribunal hearing, there may be insufficient time for written notice to be issued to the claimant, and the claim or claims have to be held back pending the decision of the social security appeal tribunal. Paragraph 2 of the schedule, and the clarifying amendment, seek to introduce a new provision so that social security appeal tribunals will be able to determine second and subsequent references by the adjudication officer, whether or not notice in writing of them has been given to the claimant. Written notice of the first reference must always be given so that the claimant is aware that his claim will be determined not by the adjudication officer but by a social security appeal tribunal and that there will be an oral hearing. In practice, where time allows, the second and subsequent references will also be notified to the claimant. The amendment puts it beyond doubt that, as before, only the adjudication
	<span class='label label-info column'>826</span>
officer may make references to the tribunal, as one independent adjudicating authority to another.
