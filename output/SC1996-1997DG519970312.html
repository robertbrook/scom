	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Transport (Mr. John Bowis)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Special Grant Report (No. 25) (Metropolitan Railway Passenger Services Grant for 1997-98) (House of Commons Paper No. 316).</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Special Grant Report (Scotland) on Grant in Aid of Expenditure on Rail Services in the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Area (House of Commons Paper No. 297).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The report sets out the measures that we are taking to ensure that passenger transport executives in England obtain financial support in 1997-98 for the cost of the local rail services that they secured under the terms of their franchise agreements with the franchising director and franchisees. My right hon. and learned Friend the Minister of State at the Scottish Office will respond separately on the Scottish special grant report for Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intended originally to continue providing support to the passenger transport executives for their rail services through the specific element of the other services block calculation for revenue support grant, as was the case for 1996-97. However, the speed and success of the franchising programme last spring compelled up to think again about the matter. We did so, because we would not have known in the autumn of 1996—when RSG settlements for the next financial year would have been provisionally set—the dates when the PTE-related franchises would come on stream and when, how or if the cost profiles of those franchises would differ from the existing costs of PTE-secured services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We decided, therefore, to switch to special grant, which enabled us to settle a formula that will track the payments due from PTEs to franchise operators under the terms of the PTE-related franchise agreements. In June last year, we proposed the special grant approach to the English passenger transport authorities, subject to their PTEs making progress on franchising in their areas. Progress was made and we confirmed the special grant approach last September. Since then, the report has been drafted. We have consulted on it with the PTEs and other parties, and it was tabled last month.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Payments under the report will be made through passenger transport authorities to the PTEs. The special grant has three purposes; it will be known as the Metropolitan railway passenger services grant—a
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
snappy little title if there ever was one. First, it will pay for the services secured by PTEs under franchise agreements. Those agreements will secure local rail services in PTE areas, which broadly reflect levels prior to franchising. Secondly, some £5 million for PTEs' direct costs will be incurred in securing those services, including the advertising of rail services in PTE areas. The final purpose behind the grant is to provide support to Tyne and Wear PTA, mainly to pay for the operating deficit of the Tyne and Wear metro. That support will total some £8 million. We estimate that the special grant in England will total about £248 million in the next financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the calculation of the grant, the franchise agreement sum payable by a PTE to a franchisee will be known as a PTE's relevant expenditure. Subject to the calculations, that will be met by a special grant. Added to that sum will be another figure that represents, in general, a PTE's direct costs. We then deduct from that total a PTE's deeds of assumption payments and, in the case of a PTE retaining revenue risk, the estimated revenue from rail services that we have calculated that a PTE will obtain in the next financial year. As for those PTEs transferring revenue risk to the franchisee, the calculation will simply be the relevant expenditure, plus direct costs, minus deeds of assumption payments. The PTEs that are transferring revenue risk to the franchisee are Greater Manchester PTE and West Yorkshire PTE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report sets out its purposes. The first annex sets out the calculations that the Department will make to ensure that PTEs receive the correct sums of money to pay for the costs arising under their franchise agreements. Final PTE bills will be subject to audit. The second annex details the conditions, such as the provision of relevant information to the Department and to auditors, surrounding the payments. It also includes provisions whereby the Secretary of State may withhold grant if a PTE has not used the grant to give the intended support for services to the service operator. The final annex describes the background to PTEs, support for rail services in PTE areas and how grant will be calculated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report covers the financial year 1997-98. It ensures that English PTEs will receive support for the rail services they have secured under franchise agreements in that year. I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.36 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the Opposition's intention to delay the Committee. We shall not oppose the reports before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for giving an explanation of the calculation, on which I shall not elaborate. He said that the franchising process had taken place at great speed, and I accept that entirely. However, the jury is out on whether the process has been as successful as he claimed. We shall have to wait to see what happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise a couple of points. PTEs have expressed concern that the amount of grant is very much based on the current levels of service provided in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
an area. Obviously, the interrelationship between services and the franchisees will develop over time, but concern has been expressed that the money allocated depends on the level of service provided in previous years. Will the grant be increased in future if services develop alongside those of the franchisees? Will more money be made available if that takes place?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the rate-capping regime in local government, it is not possible for local authorities to raise resources themselves to enhance the funds available for passenger transport. Is there an intention to examine that relationship?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that there have been discussions within the Department of Transport on whether to introduce a wider legislative framework for grant allocation rather than moving on a year-by-year basis. A wider legislative framework would make an element of planning for future services available to passenger transport authorities and executives. Are such proposals likely to be introduced—I hesitate to say it—this side of the election? The Government may not have time to introduce them otherwise. Have there been internal discussions on the future funding of local services and their relationship to the existing franchising arrangements?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the Minister's response. We welcome the fact that money will be made available to passenger transport authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.38 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his support of the reports. They were agreed with the PTEs, so there is no reason not to support them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a mildly provocative reference to the success of franchising, but I shall resist the temptation to list the enormous range of benefits that have already flowed from it or to point out that the new franchises coming on stream include a commitment to improving services. I shall content myself by saying that the success of the operation was due to the mechanics of the franchising process. It was done expeditiously and we have now completed the franchising of all the train operating companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about grants in relation to the current levels of service. We are talking about agreements made for the lifetime of the franchises, and all the PTEs played their part in discussions with the train operating companies and the franchising director. Grants are based on current levels, but we are looking ahead at the whole period of the franchise. Local authorities can, of course, add to that funding. That is perfectly permissible. But they cannot go beyond the formula in terms of funding. I accept the hon. Gentleman's comment that capping may restrict that operation, but it is up to local authorities to manage their overall budgets within that range. If they do not risk capping, they can add to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have anything to say about future formulae. Discussions that are taking place will have to continue and we shall come back after the election with further proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>

	<p>4.41 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Liddell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a specific question about the Strathclyde grant and would welcome some elucidation. My question arises largely from the fact that the arrangements for Strathclyde are more recent than for other passenger transport authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the three years of negotiations between the Strathclyde passenger transport authority and the Strathclyde PTE, Ministers gave assurances that the costs of franchising and of restructuring the railways would not affect the financial support required from council tax payers. As the SPTA is now moving to a 100 per cent. special grant fund, the £33 million from council tax payers for the support of rail services is no longer required. As 87 per cent. of that £33 million was revenue support grant, there is a saving of about 13 per cent., which the authorities should share between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, Scottish Office local government finance group circular No. 31/1996 poses the question of the SPTA being funded by a special grant, and states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Aggregate External Finance (AEF) and GAE figures and, where appropriate, capping limits of the 12 SPTA constituent councils will be adjusted accordingly."</p></blockquote>
That is the main area of concern in relation to the special grant report. Why cannot the councils not keep the 13 per cent?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that they are getting it back as part of the special grant, but given that the special grant paid through the Scottish Office originates from the Department of Transport, why is the Scottish Office keeping the 13 per cent? If, as the SPTA claims, the special grant comes from the Department of Transport, what is the Scottish Office doing with the money? That question is particularly relevant now, as Scottish local authorities are experiencing considerable difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful for some elucidation. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley), I shall not oppose the report, but in view of the proximity of the negotiations, it would be useful to have on record the Scottish Office's reasoning for keeping the 13 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.43 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Transport. The Scottish special grant will allow Strathclyde PTE to obtain financial support for the cost of the rail services under the ScotRail franchise agreement with the franchising director and National Express Group. The Scottish report is much the same as the English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) said, one minor technical difference is that the necessary funds are paid to each of the 12 councils in the SPTE area, based on population. That is necessary as the SPTA is not a local authority under the Local Government Finance Act 1992. The report obliges those councils to pay the moneys to the Strathclyde PTA for transmission to the SPTE for rail services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
To answer the hon. Lady's question, the revenue support grant control total for rail support would have been provisionally settled in the autumn of 1996. We did not then know the dates from which franchises would begin, or any cost changes involved, so the RSG control total and the distribution formula for rail services could not have accommodated the anticipated changes. Special grant provides certainty of funding for the SPTE for its franchise payment cost. That was of major benefit in facilitating the commitment to a seven-year contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Lady's questions were directed to the formula, perhaps I should explain how it is worked out. The formula is set out in paragraph 7 of annex A; it concerns funds received by the SPTE under its deeds of assumption. In broad terms, the formula ensures that the deeds of assumption receipts, after tax, are treated as a source of funding for the rail services. Various items—A, C and D—are deducted from special grant, and items D and E are added to special grant. I can explain that in detail, but the key principle is that the net sum of the amounts are deducted from special grant. That is done to ensure that the SPTE is no worse and no better off as a result of the effect of tax on the deeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked why the council cannot keep the 13 per cent. The key point is that rail services will be fully supported by special grant, so costs will not fall on local council tax payers. They will be no worse off; that is important. Decisions on any savings in 1997-98 and subsequent years will be for the Government in relation to their overall expenditure decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also briefly mention that many benefits will come from the ScotRail franchise. This year, the franchise operator, National Express Group plc, has
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
committed itself to introduce 38 new three-car electric multiple units for the SPTE network by March 2000. On the Edinburgh-Glasgow express route via Falkirk, National Express Group plc will introduce nine new three-car diesel multiple units, which will provide services of 15-minute frequency on Monday to Saturday from May 2000. Given our efforts through Forth transport infrastructure partnership to improve travel between Edinburgh and Fife, we are pleased with the doubling of the frequency of off-peak services on the Fife circle route for at least two years from 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, an additional 80,000 train miles per year will be provided during off-peak periods on the SPTE services. Importantly, National Express Group has said that ScotRail's headquarters will remain in Glasgow—something that I am sure that the hon. Lady will welcome. I commend the report to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
