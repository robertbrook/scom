	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT EDUCATION SUPPORT
<br><br><!-- lb --> GRANTS REGULATIONS 1992</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Education Support Grants Regulations 1992.</p></blockquote>
Grants for education support and training in 1993–94 will support about £320 million of local education authority expenditure, which is less than 2 per cent, of total education standard spending. The regulations cover about £225 million of that expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule to the regulations details the purposes for which grants will be payable and reflects changes in educational provision and priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the regulations to the Commitee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.31 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a commendably brief but, for my purposes, uninformative introduction by the Minister. I have several questions relating to the information provided in the schedule and the letter which the Minister kindly sent us so that we could check the facts, so to speak. Having done that, there are gaps in my understanding of what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grants for education support and training, based on national priorities identified by the Government, have changed over the years. There is a change most years; some changes are justified, others are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first issue that I wish to raise is that of health education. The Government expressed an intention to remove that issue from special support this year. That seems inappropriate at a time when the Government have chosen to highlight the problems relating to drug abuse. We recently had a drug awareness week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5 of the schedule states that the health education programme will be continued in Wales. I do not know whether the Department for Education and the Welsh Office consulted on how to approach the special grants for next year, but I commend the Welsh Office on continuing its health education programme when the Department for Education has cut its programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department claims that the programme was always intended as a pump-priming exercise and that local authorities should now assume responsibility, but the Minister must be aware of the tremendous spending pressures on local authorities. Given that drug abuse and the AIDS problem are not dirninishing, the Government should have, and could have, continued their support for health education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A couple of weeks ago in the House, I reminded the Minister that he had agreed to talk to the Secretary of States for Health and for Social
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Security, to find out whether some other form of funding might be available to enable the valuable work of the health education co-ordinators to continue. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it would be helpful to know how those consultations are progressing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not only do I agree with the hon. Gentleman but I look forward to such a response. Some means must be found for that work to continue to be supported by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department for Education invokes the principle of subsidiarity to ensure that much of the money for in-service training is devolved down to schools. I think that the Government intend to devolve about £114 million down to schools. The local authorities are being directed to make that money available to individual schools in their areas so that schools can select the kind of in-service training that they want. Several local authorities make considerable efforts to devolve more money downwards for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be interested to know how many local authorities do that, as I have not seen any figures. However, when so much money is devolved down, it can be difficult to keep together centrally provided inset training, as that is not always an easy provision for an individual school to buy in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities fear that the coherent provision of in-service training and the professional development of teachers could be lost by an obligation to devolve so much money down to individual schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister confirm that £37 million has been earmarked for special-purpose grants for grant-maintained schools so that they can be involved in the programme for LEAs and their schools? That amount is far in excess of the comparable expenditure made available to LEA schools generally. What assessment was made of the grant-maintained schools eligible for that money when it was decided how much they would receive? An excessive amount seems to have been allocated. If the Minister confirms that figure, is there provision for transferring any of that money into general expenditure under the GEST programme for LEA schools?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Special education provision has been changed significantly this year. The money available has been increased, but the Minister must be aware than many organisations involved in the provision of special education are particularly concerned about the loss of the specific grant for the training of teachers for children with hearing and visual impairments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a mandatory provision that a teacher who has taught in those sectors for three years must have the relevant qualification. There is a danger that, without a specific grant, local authorities could be tempted to employ teachers for only a few years because they cannot afford to send them on the relevant mandatory training course. The money allocated to special needs has to stretch further as the needs increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger that children with visual and hearing impairments could be taught by someone who does not have those mandatory qualifications. When the grant was specific, local authorities knew how much money they had and sent their teachers on courses to obtain the proper training. Similarly, college departments ran such courses in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0816">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
the certain knowledge that a specific grant was available. There is an excellent course at University College, Swansea in south Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is real concern about the lack of ring fencing of the money available to train teachers of children with hearing and visual impairments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the regulations for special educational needs, there is a lack of flexibility or, possibly, a lack of certainty, about how money can be made available to promote the integration of pupils with special needs into ordinary classrooms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be money to train teachers in special schools and in special classes. The regulations do not refer specifically to the provision of money to promote integration except for one small section which mentions training teachers to advise other teachers in the school on the teaching of children with special educational needs. That is a small part of the overall budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also be interested to know whether all local authorities take up the money equally, or whether there are significant differences. Those differences could result from historic patterns in the provision of special needs education or from the last reorganisation of local government when some authorities found themselves providing for a wider area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue relates to the collaboration between local education authorities and the funding agencies in respect of training teachers for children with special educational needs. If budgets are to be decreased, how does the Minister envisage that grant-maintained schools, or even LEA schools, will be able to afford the necessary training to ensure that special needs are catered for in all schools, that integration, which the Government plainly want, takes place and that parents whose children have special needs have a real choice of schools in their area?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, what are the Government doing to ensure that quality training and provision, not only for special needs but across the board, are delivered from the support grants?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding seems to have been further reduced in real terms. The overall support of £320 million that the Minister referred to is, I think, supported by a direct grant of £195 million. Last year that figure was almost £228 million. Part of the shortfall can be explained by the removal of the further education provision from that sector, but there has been a reduction in support and I want the Minister to comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few years ago, the Prime Minister's efficiency unit carried out a survey of the provisions of the two kinds of grant. It recommended that both grants be combined. That recommendation was debated in the other place on 29th November 1990. Baroness Blatch, for the Government, said that, in principle, the Government agreed with the recommendations but, because of legislative difficulties, the recommendations could not be carried out immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Baroness Blackstone, for the Opposition, responded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The benefits of a complete merger of the programme, as recommended by the scrutiny study, will not materialise."</p></blockquote>
Baroness Blatch, at the end of the debate, replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The scrutiny report recommendation for new legislation is the preferred option".—[
	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 29th November 1990; Vol. 523,1102–1108.</p></blockquote>
She went on to say that the situation would be kept under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Do the Government intend to bring forward a relatively minor Bill to amend the Education (Grants and Awards) Act 1984, which established the system? That certainly seemed to be the Government's intention in 1990. Some factors must make the grants more expensive to run separately than if they were brought together by amending the 1984 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How well is the devolvement of inset training to schools working? How confident is the Minister that devolvement is the right choice? What progress is being made in regional and sub-regional provision for blind and deaf students now that funding is provided in such a way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circular relating to the specific provision states that the provision is the only one that seems to have a ceiling of expenditure. A typical entry under the heading "Number of LEAs to be supported" in other such circulars would be, "All, subject to satisfactory proposals." In the case of the truancy circular, for example, there were 50 or 60 LEAs to be supported, about half of the authorities which were considered to have serious enough problems to warrant special support from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the training of educational psychologists, all local education authorities will be supported, subject to satisfactory bids and the ceiling of expenditure. If other programmes are free of the additional criterion—the ceiling of expenditure—the training programme for educational psychologists should not be limited or capped. The Government intend to speed up statementing, giving parents additional rights and so on, and they should be doing more to promote the training of educational psychologists so that the work of statementing and general help for children with special needs is improved. I hope that the Minister will comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year's grant provision includes new schemes for the support of 13- to 17-year-olds who might turn to a life of crime if they were not given extra help. That programme has much to commend it, as has the truancy prevention programme. We are not discussing Wales, but some new initiatives there should also be commended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will comment on my specific observations on those important matters, although less than 2 per cent, of education spending is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the original intentions of the 1984 Act was that the Government should support local authorities with specific projects on specific aspects of education which were deemed to be pioneering and worthy of Government support. The whole structure has been turned on its head and has become Government-directed in terms of the money that the Government are prepared to provide to local authorities to carry out those programmes of national importance. Hence, there is little scope for local authority initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1984 Act, there is specific provision for consultation with local authorities every year. What changes are to made to the original proposals or their administration as a result of that consultation with local authorities? All I could find in this year's consultation was an agreement by the Government to provide local authorities with the required information on a floppy disk to enable them to make their application more effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.54 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) was correct when he said that the circumstances and priorities of the programme will inevitably change. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0817">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
would be unreasonable for the programme to be the same now as it was some years ago or even last year. I hope that the Committee would expect the programme to be flexible and to reflect changing priorities. Obviously, the emergence of the grant-maintained school sector requires a shift in priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman will know from his experience of serving on another Committee—on which I and the hon. Members for Bath (Mr. Foster) and for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) also had the honour and pleasure of serving—the Government are keen to encourage the grant-maintained sector and that is reflected in the level of the special purpose grant. The grant was based on the Government's estimate of the number of grant-maintained schools that will be operating in the year ahead and the figure was exhaustively and exhaustively discussed in that Committee. I would hope that, if the level of grant turned out to be inappropriate for the number of schools, my Department's budget would be sufficiently flexible to reflect that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I anticipated, the hon. Gentleman asked about the health education element of the budget. That subject has attracted considerable attention. The grant was introduced approximately seven years ago as a pump-priming exercise. However, not only have its designation and intentions changed—it has been extended at least once—but circumstances have changed radically, not least in that health education has been included in the national curriculum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in two minds about pump-priming exercises. Often, I think that there is no point in them. They offer no political gain, precious little thanks is given for starting them and, when they end, the Government get a lot of stick. In the circumstances, one is tempted to ask whether they are worthwhile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to help local education authorities to pursue their aims. We wanted to give them more help and extended the programme but, when we decided that we had other priorities for our scarce resources, everyone was up in arms saying that it was outrageous for the Government to end that support to local education authorities. It was a difficult decision, but, having extended the grant at least once, and circumstances having changed, we decided to end the grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the AIDS problem. I suggest that the scale of the AIDS problem has not increased to the extent that was expected three, five or seven years ago when the grant was introduced. In that sort of area, one must take account of revised projections and changes in circumstances in determining resource allocation and priorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall that I referred to the fact that the health education programme is continuing in Wales. Paragraph 5 of the schedule specifically includes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"risks associated with alcohol, smoking, drug and solvent misuse, human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome."</p></blockquote>
I would like to know what the different attitudes of the two Departments are because, if anything, the problem in Wales is not as serious as it is in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Forth.</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may just reflect the extent to which the Departments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are flush with money compared with those in England. Certain
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
parts of England benefit—rightly, some would say—from much support and help from the Exchequer and they are free to spend that money however they think fit. The hon. Gentleman was simply saying that my colleagues in the Welsh Office can take a different view of priorities and use their generous funding accordingly. I applaud that and I suspect that the hon. Gentleman, in his quieter moments, would applaud that too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important to be consistent on other matters. As a general principle, we have tried, to move further towards the devolution of decision making to local education authorities, to individual schools through local management of schools and, where appropriate, to grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman cannot have it all ways. He said that it was important to keep decision making at LEA level instead of developing it to schools through LMS. It is not impossible for schools to establish different and—dare I suggest it—better priorities from those of LEAS, and they can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a different context, the hon. Gentleman seemed to be arguing that to devolve decision making and to allow a certain amount of discretion to LEAs was not necessarily a good idea. I think that he mentioned that in the context of special education grants, suggesting that, rather than having spending ring fenced by my Department, which would determine what LEAs did, he was, nervous of the thought that local education authorities might exercise a little discretion from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative members of the Committee are in the discretion business. The hon. Gentleman should come clean with us on whether he believes that schools or LEAs are capable of making their own decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the first issue of devolvement of funds to LEAs and schools for items such as in-service training, the speed at which the Minister was asking that that be done was too quick. The Minister should be considering what an LEA needs to provide a core service for in-service training which could not easily be provided by each school picking and choosing. Is there, as I would argue, an essential element that needs to be kept at LEA level to provide training across the board?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the ring fencing of money for teachers of children with visual and hearing impairments. I will give the Minister one statistic to demonstrate why I believe that the money would be better ring fenced. The British Association of Teachers of the Deaf carried out a survey in 1991 of the provision of teachers and support services for deaf children in LEAs in England and Wales. Whereas in many areas the teacher-pupil ratio was 1:9, one local authority—of which I have the number but not the name—had a teacher pupil ratio of 1:85.5. Such variations provide the case for a mandatory training award to be ring fenced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Forth.</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be a case for that but there is also a case for a body such as that to go to the authority and to exert whatever pressure it can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has lectured me frequently on local accountability and democracy in another Committee on which we are serving. He cannot have it both ways. I believe in local accountability and democracy but people must not come running to me and my Department saying, "We don't like what is going on locally through the democratic process. Will you please mandate something different?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0818">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

The system cannot work that way. The hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members should take up the case with the local education authority concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 236 of the Education Bill on which the hon. Gentleman and I are serving will simplify the arrangements for specific grants. Its effect will be to unify the two previously separate grant schemes so that, in future, grants for teacher-training for other purposes will be paid under a single statute. That is, in part, the Department's response to the hon. Gentleman's comments about the debates in the other place during 1990. That response may not cover everything but we felt that it was the right way to proceed on that Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked important questions about special educational needs training. Again, this relates to my earlier comments. We have recently completed a thorough review of special educational needs training and one of the main conclusions was to combine previously separate grants to make one grant and to increase the cover for all special educational needs categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
LEAs will be in a position to determine exactly what special educational needs training is required in their areas and to obtain grant support to facilitate such training. That reflects our increasing willingness in cases such as this to allow a modest increase in provision when appropriate and to allow education authorities to determine their own provison and priority. The risk is that if an LEA does not then allocate to priorities with which the Government would agree, we are stuck with that and the local democratic process through electors, parents, people involved in special educational needs training, pressure groups and others must try to correct that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government said clearly that no teacher who is involved with hearing or sight-impaired children should teach such children for more than three years without obtaining the relevant special qualification. If there was evidence of a local authority laying off teachers of hearing or sight-impaired children in a revolving process before three years had expired and then taking on other untrained teachers, would the Minister have the power to act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give a specific answer, but if the hon. Gentleman will write to me, I will give him a proper answer. More importantly, if he will give me examples, I shall follow them up to see what we should be doing about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
I accept the hon. Gentleman's argument that if an authority or school is failing in its statutory duty, acting outside the guidelines issued by my Department or failing properly to provide for pupils, and so on, we want to know about that, if it has not been picked up through any of the existing checks. We would then take the appropriate action. Schools and authorities do not have total licence to do as they wish with the money or to misuse it, abuse it, or fail to deploy it properly. I invite the hon. Gentleman to provide examples, which I shall then investigate in my Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a general point about the overall size of the programme. This year's GEST programme is not comparable with those of previous years for several reasons—the removal or further education, the increasing size of the grant-maintained sector and others. The programme is broadly on a par with previous years, but there have been changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the new truancy prevention programme, for which the Secretary of State found £10 million. I hope that that programme will be imaginative and will rely largely on responses from local education authorities, whose response has been encouraging; 60 or 70 of the 100 or so local education authorities have responded with schemes from which we hope to develop some imaginative responses to truancy. Those responses came not only from authorities with a higher incidence of truancy, but from some which believe that they have answers to the problems. We shall share that information in a best practice way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been able to sustain the programme in these difficult times. We have debated the different prioritites, to reflect changing circumstances and we have discussed devolution of decision-making to authorities and schools where appropriate. I hope that the Committee will support the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
