	<div class='title'>AUTHORITIES SUBJECT TO DESIGNATION</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 302, in page 36, line 42, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"() In this Chapter any powers given to the Secretary of State to designate an authority shall not apply if that authority has complied with section 32 above or in the case of a major precepting authority section 43 above.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would allow a Secretary of State to designate or cap an authority only when it had failed to comply with the statutory provisions for determining its budget or precept. It would leave the capping procedure in place but prevent the Secretary of State from using it except when an authority had failed to act lawfully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not conceal the fact that the amendment is designed to wreck capping. That will be no surprise to Ministers, as we are opposed to capping in principle. The amendment would, in most cases, end capping powers. We believe that the case against capping is overwhelming, and our arguments, which we have employed on many occasions, will by now be familiar. However, it is not only the Labour party which has expressed root-and-branch opposition to capping; several remarkable people have, from time to time, said that they could not tolerate capping. One of the earliest such opinions was expressed in 1984 when the capping power was first proposed. In a letter to the Conservative party newsletter, "Newsline", Rosalie Mondiot, who was then leader of South Oxfordshire district council, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What we are concerned about is that this ill thought out bill will… constitutionally damage the recognised right of local authorities to levy their own rates and to be accountable in a local democratically elected manner."</p></blockquote>
That is the authentic voice of someone who understands and is dedicated to local government and the principle of local democracy. I believe that South Oxfordshire district council sat in Henley—at that time I was living fairly nearby. The fact that the letter came from a Conservative leader of a Conservative local authority adds weight to her spirited defence of local government democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mrs Mondiot was not alone in her opposition. The Association of District Councils provided a briefing for the Second Reading debate on the Rates Bill
	<span class='label label-info column'>784</span>
in 1984. That association is Tory controlled, yet it stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Association is deeply convinced that a vigorous democratic and independent local government is an indispensible part of our national system of government. The previous Conservative government recognised this… It declared that 'local government was an essential part of the whole democratic framework of government' and that, above all else, a genuine local democracy implies that decisions should be taken—and seen to be taken—as locally as possible."</p></blockquote>
That view was echoed by John Lovill who was then chairman of the Association of County Councils, again a local authority association dominated by the Conservatives. He is reported as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill would give (the Secretary of State)… powers well beyond those which he has now and which will impinge on the autonomy of local authorities to take decisions about the level and quality of services delivered locally to their community."</p></blockquote>
That was powerful testimony from Tory figures in local government when the capping power was introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can bring that picture up to date. Mr. Roy Thomason was until recently the Tory leader of the Association of District Councils. That association is still, by the skin of its teeth, Conservative dominated. In 1991, he said of the Local Government Finance and Valuation Act 1991, which extended capping to every council in the land:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am shocked that the Government should so attack many of its own supporters in local government, particularly district councils which have raided their balances to keep charge levels down this year and maintained services. It is also shocking that the Environment Secretary should completely ignore all the assurances previous ministers gave when the capping provisions were introduced that low spending authorities would be excluded from the controls."</p></blockquote>
The announcement of the provisionsal 1992 capping criteria a week or two ago prompted a joint press release from the five national local authority associations condemning universal capping. The position of local government is therefore very clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaves the theory of capping, will he say whether he accepts that the position of local authorities in the democratic system leaves control ultimately with central Government? What does he perceive as the difference between a formalised capping procedure and the way in which the Labour Government of the late 1970s sought to control local authority expenditure by way of circular? If that process had gone on for a period of time and expenditure had not fallen in accordance with the Government's wishes, would that not have led to firmer measures along lines very similar to capping?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Central Government will always attempt to influence the direction of local government. That is right and proper and local government understands that. However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree—it was implicit in his question—that there is a world of difference between that attempt to exercise influence and the taking of statutory powers to regulate every budget, cut and bill. The hon. Gentleman's question made it clear that however seriously he regarded the former Labour Government's actions, he realised that those actions were a long way from the formal assumption of capping powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>785</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do, but my point is that if central Government consider containment of expenditure to be an important principle, they will resort to capping if exhortation fails and if such containment cannot be achieved in any other way. However, if the plans are clear, local authorities can understand what they must do and set about curtailing their expenditure. The pressure is the same as that exerted by means of circular. Either central Government require local authorities to do something about expenditure, or they do not. If they do, the question is merely one of degree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Questions of degree count enormously. There is a huge difference of degree between taking statutory powers and issuing advice. In any case, if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I shall return later in my speech to the reasons that the Government have advanced for taking universal capping powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, all I was seeking to do before that intervention was to establish that many senior figures in local government, including most leading Conservative figures representing the local authority associations, had expressed hostility to the concept. I shall now move on to present some other opinions. In July this year, when the Government announced the extension of capping to every council in the country, a leader in 
	<i>The Times</i> described it as
	<br><blockquote><p>"an offence against local democracy far more outrageous than anything M Delors is proposing for monetary and political union."</p></blockquote>
There is room for judgment on some of those questions: nevertheless, that is the view of 
	<i>The Times.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the hon. Gentleman's view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a close-run thing. It was interesting to note that the right hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) excoriated economic and monetary union on the ground that he could think of nothing worse to say about a British Government and Parliament being under the heel of European commissars than to describe them as being like a rate-capped local authority. That showed clearly what that leading member of the Conservative party thought of rate capping and its impact on local government democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only newspapers, however weighty, that have taken such a view. I see a weary smile passing over the Minister's features because he knows what is coming. On this occasion, it involves not him but the Secretary of State, who has a long record in that regard. Certainly, that record is long because it extends from 1979 to 1990, as I shall shortly demonstrate, but I am afraid that I cannot say that it is honourable because the right hon. Gentleman abandoned that position, apparently, for no good reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1979, when the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) was Secretary of State for the first time, he told local authorities:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We will sweep away tiresome and excessive control over local government. Local councils are directly elected. They are answerable to their electorate. They do not need, they do not want, the fussy supervision of detail that now exists."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>786</span>
That has a surprising ring in the light of what the right hon. Gentleman is now doing. He was not to be dissuaded from that position by his first experience as Secretary of State when he contemplated, as no doubt he was doing in May last year, the prospect of returning to office. Perhaps he was contemplating a somewhat different office, but as he must have recognised the possibility of returning in some shape or form to responsibilities for local government, he was still at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 
	<i>The Times</i> of 10 May 1990, he wrote that universal capping would be
	<br><blockquote><p>"an act of centralised power outside our experience. On those grounds alone it should be resisted."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents…</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That interesting comment throws light on the relationship between the Minister and the Secretary of State. Clearly, the Minister sees himself as a pillar of virtue, a man of unmovable rectitude and a man who has always set his face against local government democracy and believed in the imposition of central control. How he must have chafed as the present Secretary of State, in his various capacities in the past decade or so, proclaimed the great virtues of local government democracy. Now, triumph is with the Minister because he has said that the Secretary of State has been forced to repent and to step into line. The Minister now determines those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the Secretary of State is not present as an observer, but no doubt he will read the record in 
	<i>Hansard</i> when some of his more assiduous supporters draw it to his attention. I believe that the right hon. Gentleman has been compelled to do the bidding of his junior in the Department and that is very sad. The Secretary of State stuck to his principles on that issue for a long time and was a champion of local government. It is a pity that he should have been persuaded or compelled to abandon those principles at such a late date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The record is replete with statements from all sorts of people, including the Secretary of State, to the effect that the principle of capping is anathema to the concept of true local government democracy. I do not intend to deploy the whole argument against capping, but I shall refer to another set of objections to the basis on which the criteria for capping are selected. They are, to some degree, selected on the basis of standard spending assessments. There is a wide range of evidence that SSAs are deeply flawed. If the basis is flawed, so is the capping that is based upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government consultation paper stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The SSA system is based on extensive research and provides about as fair a way of measuring needs as can be devised."</p></blockquote>
That was immediately contradicted by Mr. Ken Morris, the county treasurer of Northumberland county council, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This bland statement is as crass as it is indefensible."</p></blockquote>
That is pretty harsh language; Mr. Morris clearly felt very strongly about the issue. Later, I may give an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>787</span>
example of one factor that might have led him to that strong expression of opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's immediate predecessor, the right hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Patten), who is now chairman of the Tory party, agreed in early 1990, I think, that SSAs were flawed and needed revision. He promised that he would do something about it, but nothing has been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider some respects in which SSAs have proved to be an uncertain basis on which to measure anything, let alone capping power. In 1989, the AMA criticised the way that the highway maintenance SSA was calculated. In relation to road lengths, it said that the data on relative maintenance costs had been built up on the basis of a 1980 survey by the Association of County Councils of a handful of sparsely populated counties. The AMA said that the data were out of date and completely unrepresentative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The AMA said that the data on traffic flows were unreliable and that the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment kept producing different and incompatible sets of figures and were unable to explain the discrepancies. AMA representatives were unable to recreate or reconcile figures given to them for their own authorities. The AMA said that the data were unstable. The Department of Transport produced evidence of changes of up to 6 per cent per annum for authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1990–91, according to the SSAs for highway maintenance produced by the Department of the Environment, outer London was spending £15 million, or 13 per cent more than its SSAs, and inner London was spending £36 million, or 60 per cent more than its SSAs. Despite all the evidence of deteriorating roads in the capital, the Government believed that there should be a substantial cut in road maintenance in London. In 1992–93, SSAs for highway maintenance have been increased by only 1.1 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the category "Other Services", it is striking that the SSA for flood defence was distributed mistakenly in 1990–91. Past expenditure was dominated by Thames Water precepts on boroughs which were proportional to rateable value. In 1990–91, however, the precepts were proportional to adults, but the SSA was still allocated on the basis of rateable value. The result was a substantial gain—surprise, surprise—for Westminster and to a lesser extent Camden, while other authorities ended up with inadequate SSAs and higher poll tax bills in their areas as a consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the vexed aspect of capital spending, the main element of SSA is calculated by adding together debt repayment and interest charges for the debt outstanding, including debt that is likely to arise during the financial year. A figure is taken subtracted to reflect the interest that is earned on capital receipts. That sounds reasonably logical. However, as Rita Hale, an expert on these matters, explained during her time at CIPFA:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The main weakness in the SSA calculation is the starting point—the figure for the assumed debt outstanding at 31 March 1990. That figure is derived from adjusted GRE figures for 1989/90, but those GREs did not cover the debt charges for all local authority services and only covered the cost of financing
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
capital expenditure incurred after 1 April 1981 for that limited range of services. So the notional debt figure is merely a construct; it bears no consistent relationship to the actual figures for individual authorities."</p></blockquote>
As a consequence, the debt repayment figures used in the calculation of SSAs are often substantially different from the actual debt repayments that an authority must make. Matters get worse, however. The Association of London Authorities pointed out:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The assumptions that are built into the SSA calculation about the interest authorities will earn on capital receipts lead to the DoE assuming authorities will receive income they have no hope of raising, because they do not have the implicit capital balances in hand."</p></blockquote>
That may explain the harsh language of Mr. Ken Morris, the county treasurer of Northumberland county council. As a consequence of those factors, the SSA for Northumberland for 1990–91 assessed the county's interest receipts on balances at £4 million. In reality, however, interest receipts were only £2 million, so Northumberland poll tax payers lost £2 million in lost grant because of the formula.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to follow from what the hon. Gentleman says that he believes that the grant should be given on the basis of the actual interest receipts of authorities, rather than on their notional receipts. It would follow from that that we would give more grant to authorities that had smaller balances of smaller interest receipts, and we would give less grant to those that had greater interest receipts. The result would be that authorities that ran down their balances to an imprudent level would get more money and authorities that were particularly prudent and built up large balances to defend themselves against eventualities of which they knew not would get less grant. Would the hon. Gentleman propose such a system if he became a member of a Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not my business to propose systems. My argument is that there is no point in having an SSA for that purpose if it bears no relationship to reality. I am about to demonstrate that Northumberland county council and many other local authorities find themselves penalised because an assumption which is not borne out by the facts is made about their interest receipts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that there is no point in an element based on notional interest receipts that bears no relationship to reality. There is a point, however, because what the Government give in grant can have a normative effect. It can tend to suggest to local authorities that a particular level of balances and interest receipts is desirable because authorities will be compensated on that level. In other words, it can point out to local authorities that there will be no benefit—as there would be under the system that the hon. Gentleman proposes—in running down their balances in order to obtain a larger sum in grant. I am concerned that there should not be perverse incentives in the system to encourage local authorities to do what would not be prudent. Notional elements tend to encourage behaviour that is not imprudent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's comments are interesting and give us an insight into the opaque
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>789</span>
considerations and calculations that motivated Ministers to reach their mysterious conclusions. No wonder local authorities feel bemused and puzzled by what central Government are doing, if the Minister says that he is using this factor in the SSAs not because it bears any relation to reality but for normative purposes. Local government will find that extremely interesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that local authorities are likely to be bemused by what the Government are doing, and I am sure that the Minister knows that that is the case. Over the years, district auditors have often chastised local councils because they have built their balances up too high. It is a question of judgment as to how councils can keep their balances. It is not easy for them to work such things out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Local authority treasurers are worried that their capital position is judged for the purposes of SSAs, not in the ordinary way but according to those normative standards mentioned by the Minister. They want to know what those standards are, how they will apply, what relationship they will bear to the SSA and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a few examples of how justly irate local authorities are likely to be when their SSAs do not seem to bear any relationship to their actual receipts or debts. Welwyn and Hatfield has budgeted for debt charges this year of £3,169,000; yet the SSA for debt charges was £901,000. That shortfall of £2,295,000 is a substantial proportion—32.9 per cent—of the 1991–92 SSA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impact seems to have been particularly dramatic in new towns. Basildon has budgeted for debt charges of £7,855,000, yet the SSA was only £1,446,000—a difference of £6,409,000, or 53 per cent of the 1991–92 SSA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes my point splendidly. Does he mean that whatever level of indebtedness a local authority gets itself into, and whatever level of debt charges is paid, the Government should compensate it for the actual amount? That is an extraordinary proposition. SSAs should not encourage profligate or imprudent behaviour, and should not be driven by the behaviour of a local authority. The system would quickly unravel if local authorities were able to contrive matters so that if they spent more they would receive more in grant. The good thing about the system is that it is based upon an assessment of needs, not driven by what local authorities spend. A system that is driven by spending means, of course, that local authorities will spend more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a long list, but I shall not weary the Committee with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Go on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If The Under-Secretary of State is foolish enough to challenge me, I may take up the
	<span class='label label-info column'>790</span>
challenge, but the Committee would regret his intemperate intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we hear from the Minister is remarkable. What is the point of SSAs if they are to be used arbitrarily and bear no relationship to actuality?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made a fair point. The Minister constantly changes the rules of the game to cast local authorities in that mythical role trotted out by Conservative Members. I shall give an example. Bristol city council had a municipal dock which carried various debt charges. The city council negotiated with the Department of the Environment for a restructured loan—it was a good deal—and the Department assured the council that it would not be included for debt purposes in the SSA. The next year, the Department included the debt in the SSA, which gave Bristol enormous financial problems. The Department of the Environment changed its mind from one year to the next in order to attack the hard-working councillors, officers and representatives of that city, casting them in a ridiculous light.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham referred to the impact of SSAs on new towns. The Minister said in reply that those local authorities "got themselves into debt". In most cases, that capital debt was not of their making, because they had to take over the housing assets of the development corporations of the new towns. I was a member of the new towns committee of the ADC for many years. We were always battling with the Government to make them realise that capital projects in new towns have to be built and financed by local authorities to service the development corporations that built the new towns in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are indebted to my hon. Friend for his expertise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A few minutes ago the hon. Gentleman skipped neatly over the point about whether he had any proposals of his own by saying that he did not feel that it was his job to do so. As the Labour party has changed its mind on local government finance so often in the past few years, we are asking the hon. Gentleman to clarify the proposals that he already has and to tell the Committee what he would do in the situation that my hon. Friend the Minister posed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not correct to say that we have changed our minds many times. We published our proposals on local government taxation well before the Government got around to doing so. Those who have bothered to read "Fair Rates" will know that it has stood up remarkably well in the 16 months since it was published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we do not propose to use SSAs in the same way as the Government, I see no need to go into the detail of individual SSAs, except to criticise the way that the Government apply them. Let us consider some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>791</span>
services that are not covered by SSAs. For example, some district councils provide services such as helping the frail elderly and providing community alarm services. I have often visited such useful and valuable places and I know that they are much appreciated by elderly people. Some local authorities run day-care centres, workplace nurseries, meals on wheels and a range of schemes that enable people to stay in their homes. Such services are not accounted for: local authorities get no allowance in the SSA for providing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is estimated that providing such services costs Harlow £35 per adult, Basildon £18 and Elmbridge— not a Labour-controlled authority—£11. We can conclude that the SSA system, which is the basis of grant and of capping—which is where insult is added to injury—is widely acknowledged to be in need of reform and to be unreliable in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has cited good examples. SSAs are used as a basis for capping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend twice quoted the example of Basildon: first, in relation to debt charges, which are 53 per cent of its SSA, and again in regard to the vital social services that it provides, such as workplace nurseries and meals on wheels at a cost of £18 per adult, which is not covered by its SSA. The hon. Member for Basildon (Mr. Amess), who is not a Labour Member, has talked up the capping of that local authority, despite the examples that my hon. Friend has cited. Surely the hon. Member for Basildon is irresponsible in doing that because he is talking against the interests of his constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is right. It is a matter on which the electorate in Basildon will make their judgment, which may not be favourable to the hon. Member for Basildon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have used a range of arguments to justify capping. Their first argument was that, without capping, councils would take advantage of the change in local government finance. That argument has been revived in the wake of the community charge reduction scheme—the alleged £140 reduction in the headline poll tax bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That argument was first deployed when it was proposed to have a confusing duality of rates and poll tax. It was feared that some authorities would take advantage of the difficulties that that would cause to increase expenditure. The then Minister of State, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), referred to a selective capping power—no doubt, to deal with those few authorities wicked enough to exploit poll tax payers under cover of the confusion created by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the time the poll tax had become law, it was decided that it was such a wonderful system—some people thought that it would be a vote winner—that it should be introduced with no run-in or transitional period, so that argument fell away. There was no confusion, or so it was thought, and everything was for the best in the best of all possible worlds. Nevertheless, after a short time, the right hon. and learned Gentleman argued that capping would be
	<span class='label label-info column'>792</span>
needed to protect the poll tax payer against "outbreaks of irrational behaviour".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman knows all about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. In October 1987, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Let me make it clear that we are only taking such powers because of the appalling record of a dozen or so authorities in managing their affairs under the present system."</p></blockquote>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman was clear and specific about the irrational behaviour of a small number of authorities. However unpleasant and unattractive the principle of capping was, it was accepted and acted upon because of those authorities. That is very far removed from the current proposals to threaten with capping every local authority in the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
the right hon. and learned Gentleman made it clear a few months later in April 1988 that he was referring to "a reserve measure" or "a reserve power" that would deal with the "extravagant and irresponsible". The extravagance and irresponsibility turned out to be not that of a handful of local authorities but that of the Government, because they forced up poll tax bills by a range of miscalculations, deliberate or otherwise, by over-optimistic assumptions about collection levels and by short-changing local government through central Government grant. That caused the problems of high poll tax bills. The argument about the dozen or so irresponsible authorities tended to fade away in the light of the tremendous upsurge of anger about the general level of the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Gentleman then said that, even with the introduction of capping, he wanted to defend local choice and local democracy. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The people in an area certainly will be able to vote for a relatively high-spending authority if they so choose."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 25 April 1988; Vol. 132, c.51.]</p></blockquote>
That right has now been taken away from them by the triumph of the Minister of State over all those backsliders and people whose commitment to central Government control is less than pure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have listened for almost an hour to the hon. Gentleman agonising over this part of the clause. He said fairly and clearly that the Labour party would not introduce capping. He said that our proposals for capping are a reserve power of which he does not approve. He said that the Labour party would not have no controls, to use his double negative. He said also that he wanted a reserve power to stop excessive spending. What is the difference between Labour's reserve power and the Government's reserve power, which is called capping?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One problem with this debate is that Conservative Members whom one assumes might be students of local authority matters seem unwilling to understand or remember statements by Labour Members. Let me make it perfectly clear yet again
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>793</span>
that we oppose the principle of capping and do not propose in any circumstances to cap local authorities. The hon. Gentleman assumed that I described the Government's current powers as reserve powers, but those were not my words. If he had been following the debate more closely, he would have realised that I was quoting the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe, who told the House that they were merely reserve powers to be exercised only in relation to a handful of overspending and irresponsible authorities. It is not my argument that the current powers are reserve powers. Far from it; they are the most draconian, universal and comprehensive of powers. If the hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the hon. Gentleman may have heard it. The point was put to me that a local authority is beyond legal control, that it can do and spend whatever it likes and the law is impotent—it cannot touch it. As I elaborated later, I used the term "in extremis" to make the point that in cases of fraud or ultra vires actions the law would apply, but I have never said that we wanted to apply a capping power. I have always been clear about that. I hope that that explanation will put this issue to bed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being more than usually obtuse. The only reason that I mentioned reserve power is that I am quoting the use of that phrase by the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe who referred to a reserve power in 1988 to reduce opposition to his proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quoting the hon. Member for Dagenham when, as reported in the "Today" newspaper of 27 March 1990, he said:

In response to further questioning, he defined it further:
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"What I am saying to you—I am not ducking the question—I am saying in extremis that reserve power would have to be reserved, but it's impossible to say in advance what those circumstances would be."</p></blockquote>
In the intervening year and a half, has the hon. Gentleman worked out what those circumstances might be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me go over it again. The hon. Gentleman seems unaware that he has quoted from the radio interview to which I was referring and in which I explained clearly that I was talking about reserve power in extremis which the Government must always claim to restrain illegality, fraud and ultra vires actions. If the hon. Gentleman wants me to repeat that, I shall do so gladly, but if he is satisfied, I hope that we can move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a local authority acts ultra vires or fraudulently, the law will come into operation. Therefore, it was pointless of the hon. Gentleman to mention the radio interview. He said that, under a Labour Government, as long as a local authority keeps within the law and does not act fraudulently or ultra vires, it may spend whatever it wants and that there would be no comeback from a Labour Chancellor or a Labour Secretary of State for the Environment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to emphasise that we do not support the principle of capping. We would not cap local authorities just because our view of their legitimate levels of spending differed from theirs. That is what local democracy is about, which is why we believe in it. For centuries, local government functioned well on the basis of that principle. Only the present Government have felt it necessary to cap local authorities. It was not the rates but the poll tax that increased bills to the great discomfort and anger of millions of local government tax payers. The Government's ill-considered and disastrous innovations under the poll tax legislation have put pressure on local authorities to keep the bills down. That is why they are trying to frighten people about further increases in their bills. As long as we have the poll tax and the prospect of the council tax, those fears will be all too well founded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely it is time that we dealt with the implications of the Bill.

Why are the Government trying to divert us from that assertion? Are they trying to cover it up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's speculation is not too wide of the mark. We have the most centralising Government in modern times. The Secretary of State has found a soul mate in his Minister of State. They are both centralisers. That is why the Secretary of State's hitherto well-established principle has been abandoned, and why he is now embracing the concept of universal capping.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not make such an accusation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the hon. Gentleman's argument about the influence of central Government on local government, he admits much by blaming such pressure on the poll tax. The pressure first arose from the considerable increase in local authority spending in the 1970s. That, coupled with the impact of inflation, led the then Labour Government heavily to influence the expenditure of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has said that he does want the power of capping. Is he saying that he would not restrict the expenditure of local authorities by circular—a method which was used by a previous Labour Government—or some other mechanism? He claims that he is opposed to the principle of capping, but is he opposed to the principle of central Government influencing local authority spending by some other method?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a little naive if his argument is that there is no real difference in the contextual factors that local authorities must take into account—for example, the Government's attitude to grants and the economic position. It is proper that such factors are taken into account. But there is a great difference between those factors and central Government taking statutory powers by legislation to tell local authorities, to the last penny, what their budgets must be. There is a world of difference between the two. The hon. Gentleman would surely not argue that they are the same set of influences, because they are clearly different. I should be astonished if local government did not take account of central Government's views on some of the issues, but that is a different proposition from capping.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to grant. Is he saying that a Labour Government would not use the grant? My hon.

If a local authority overspent whan a Labour Government was in power, would they reduce the grant to that local authority to encourage it to follow the Government's guidelines?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what I said. There will be limits to the grant that a Labour Government will be prepared to allocate, and local government will take that into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Labour party reduce it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I did not say that. We will not reduce it but local government will properly take that
	<span class='label label-info column'>796</span>
factor into account when they set their budgets. It would be surprising if that were not the case. My point is that that is a different proposition from the Government's capping proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will confirm that another reserve power in Labour's programme is to have annual elections of local councils. If a council goes crazy and increases bills substantially in one go, it will be out of order with its electorate. That is a far better reserve power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. We have repeatedly explained that policy at length. It is in line with out belief in local government democracy, in marked contrast to the Conservative party view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the lengthy series of interventions, I considered some of the arguments advanced by Ministers to support the need for capping: that local government would exploit any confusion; that the poll tax payer needed protection; that this was a reserve power that would apply only to a handful of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One argument deployed by the Minister of State was that capping is an essential part of the overall macro-economic strategy. According to the Minister, the Government have a responsibility to
	<br><blockquote><p>"ensure that individual authorities cannot, for whatever reason, endanger our wider economic objectives."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 21 May 1991, Vol. 191;c.837.]</p></blockquote>
That is an interesting argument. In may 1991, the basis for extending the capping powers was expressed by the Minister as being the need to secure those wider macro-economic objectives. That was contradicted by the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire) at a time when the Government did not propose to cap councils with budgets of less than £15 million. To justify that ceiling he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That is why authorities with small budgets are exempted from these clauses. The real risks to local and national economies come from the huge spending authorities which spend vast sums rather than from the small ones".—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 25 April 1988, Vol. 132, c.41.]</p></blockquote>
Even he recognises that the Minister's attempt to justify the extension of capping to the tiniest district authority with a very small budget is hardly to be taken seriously or regarded as a major factor in the Government's macro-economic policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever support it may have received from leading local authority figures, leading Conservatives, and the Secretary of State, the basis for capping and the SSAs on which capping decisions are based is shot through with inconsistencies and confusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, we do not believe that the powers conferred on the Government under the Bill should be accepted. The amendment would not strike out capping directly, but at least it would provide some protection to local authorities that had set their budgets according to law. Such authorities should be able to put their spending plans to the local electorate, secure its support and carry them through. That is the local democracy in which we believe, but it will be totally destroyed by the universal capping powers proposed by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>; I support the first-class expose of the capping system provided by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). He detailed what has gone wrong over the past few years and explained that matters are likely to get worse under the proposals. He referred to the plight of the new towns and the implications of SSAs on capital budgets. All the new towns in England, Wales and Scotland are special cases with regard to capital budgets. Over 20 or 30 years, development corporations built up the new towns at the behest of the Government. The housing and commercial asssets, factories and industries were built up by the Government. However, in the 1970s and 1980s, local authorities took over the housing and, in some cases, the industrial assets of the new towns. To a large extent, local authorities took over responsibility for their debts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the towns developed, leisure and education facilities and so on had to be provided by the local authorities. That meant new buildings, which incurred new debt. It is important for the Government to realise that the debt thereby incurred, which has to be accounted for in the budgets of the new towns, is a direct result of the Government's desire to build those new towns, it is not the result of overspending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham referred to small authorities. Over the past six or seven months the Government have made a U-turn with regard to district councils with budgets below £15 million a year. You, Sir Michael, may recall that when we discussed the poll tax Bill in this Committee Room, we were constantly told about the inadequacies and difficulties of Lambeth, Camden and other London boroughs. Very little reference was made to the hundreds of local authorities of all political persuasions throughout the country that did a marvellous job. Earlier, we heard more prejudiced nonsense about several local authorities. The majority of local authorities are good, yet they will all be included within the same net.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government introduced the poll tax in 1988, at least they had the sense not to extend capping powers to the smaller districts. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Government have gone against the advice provided by local authority associations—some of whom are controlled by the Conservative party—not to apply capping to those smaller districts. The Association of Metropolitan Authorities was obviously opposed to the capping of local authorities. However, the Association of District Councils, which is controlled by the Conservative party, clearly stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Association thoroughly opposes the principle and practice of capping local authority expenditure. Complete local accountability cannot be achieved if the Government funds 85 per cent of expenditure and effectively determines the overall spending of individual authorities. In these circumstances, the local ability to set a tax, to raise 25 per cent of expenditure, is a highly restricted form of local discretion. The Local Government Finance Bill repeats the current legislation on capping but gives the Secretary of State even more powers to restrict local authority expenditure."</p></blockquote>
It is backed by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, by the Society of County Treasurers and the Council of Welsh Districts. In
	<span class='label label-info column'>798</span>
Wales the problem of capping is more acute, dangerous and damaging, as only 8 per cent of local government expenditure is controlled by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council of Welsh Districts stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the preferable basis for councils to make local decisions"</p></blockquote>
is by being
	<br><blockquote><p>"answerable in the local ballot box not constrained by central dictate."</p></blockquote>
That
	<br><blockquote><p>"is the best way to afford local accountability, responsibility and democracy."</p></blockquote>
I presume that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales is listening to me. The worst thing about the whole business is that there has been no instance of capping either with district or county councils in Wales. Welsh local government is not profligate or spendthrift.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed legislation to introduce capping of Welsh local authorities is an insult to the good relations that have existed over the past few years between Governments of all political persuasions and local government in Wales. There is no point in passing the legislation other than to sour those relations and to make local government even less attractice to those who wish to enter it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As local government is in a mess because of central Government's control over it, the biggest problem is that people no longer want to become local councillors. It is telling that in the previous council elections in Wales, which were held only a few months ago, hundreds of seats were uncontested simply because people did not want to become part of the new system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my borough, of the 44 seats on the district council, 27 were unopposed—I am delighted to say that Labour councillors stood for them—but that does nothing for local democracy or government. One of the reasons why people did not contest those seats was that they saw no future as local councillors—they cannot even determine local taxation. They would be elected to decide only what to cut and not to cut instead of what to do. The capping provisions in the Bill will make matters worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most unsavoury aspect of the Bill is the possible extension of that silly system to parish councils. It is dotty to extend the net of capping legislation to parishes and communities—the smallest of our units of local government. I hope that the Minister, in consultation with his colleague the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, will clarify the issues that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been tempted to catch your eye for some time, Sir Michael, as I am sure that you and I and other members of the Committee feel that we have been down this road many times. The plain fact is that the Government have been required to introduce legislation to contain local government expenditure—now called capping—because, contrary to what has been said by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), history has shown us that local authorities will not reduce
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>799</span>
their expenditure unless the Government have powers to so do. Often local authorities will deliberately flaunt the Government's wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the ghastly experience of the winter of discontent, the trust between central and local government vanished because Labour councils lost confidence in the Labour Government. The Labour Government at the time and later the Conservative government had to use the blunt instruments available, which effectively meant that smaller authorities requiring some form of protection had to share the pain with larger authorities and profligate city authorities. The Government had to introduce clear, precise and specific measures because of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->

Local authorities were asked through the usual consensus arrangements to make cuts to the tune of £1,000 million. That would be the same as asking local authorities today to restrain spending to the tune of some £4 billion. If any members of the Committee believe that local authorities would volunteer to do that without legal capping powers, they do not live in the real world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has summed up the situation. In the real world many councils have deliberately flouted the Government's desire in favour of making narrow political points. That was true under the previous Labour Government, and because of the loss of trust, the Conservative Government inherited a soured relationship between central and local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the Conservative party's point of view, it was tragic that when local government was invited to reduce expenditure, the Conservative-controlled authorities that largely met that request, suffered. That was true in Scotland where my local authority of Perth and Kinross district had to share the pain with Dundee district, which had been profligate. Perth and Kinross had been prudent and had little fat, but it had to cut services to meet the requirement of reduced expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also deal with the nonsense and myth of central Government cutting funds to local government. In terms of Scottish expenditure, the money received from central Government through various grants is 9 per cent higher in real terms over and above the rate of inflation than the money received in 1979. The plain truth is that the situation is political. Individuals who wish to make a political point use their powers at local level to embarrass, inconvenience and, if possible, flout the Government's wishes. The Government require capping powers because they must control the overall economic picture of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are sensible spokesmen on finance on the Labour Benches, such as one or two Scottish Members—unfortunately, not members of this Committee—who aspire to sit on the Front Bench of a future Labour Government. They say clearly that
	<span class='label label-info column'>800</span>
they will require to contain and control expenditure centrally and locally. That is the logic and sense behind capping powers. Governments hope that they will never have to use them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) made some important points about the relationship between local authorities and central Government. It is not the function of our democracy to convert local authorities into sub-offices of Whitehall Departments operating at the behest of Ministers of either political persuasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) pointed out, the essence of local democracy is that the local authority is accountable to its electorate and is democratically elected. By extending capping powers, the Government are making a frontal assault on the principle of local democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Capping procedures have been described as an offence against local democracy. In July 1991 the Government extended capping to every council, a measure that a leader in 
	<i>The Times</i> called
	<br><blockquote><p>"an offence against local democracy far more outrageous than anything M Delors is proposing for monetary and political union."</p></blockquote>

	<i>The Times</i> is hardly an in-house journal for the Labour party, although given the disarray on Conservative Benches, on their attitude to monetary and political union—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The central question is whether local government should be under the exclusive control of central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have quoted extensively this evening and it would be interesting to follow the trajectory of many Members—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Lady say treachery?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not suggest such a thing, Sir Michael, knowing that you would rule me out of order. I should say instead "misguided actions and interpretations".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Twelve years ago in July 1979, the Secretary of State for the Environment said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We will sweep away tiresome and excessive control over local government. Local councils are directly elected. They are answerable to their electorate. They do not need, they do not want, the fussy supervision of detail that now exists."</p></blockquote>
If hon. Members consider that to be a long time ago, perhaps a later quotation from May 1990 will do. The right hon. Gentleman described the introduction of universal capping as
	<br><blockquote><p>"an act of centralised power outside our experience. On those grounds alone it should be resisted".</p></blockquote>
Yet we now again have extensive capping powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to repeat the forceful arguments that have been advanced on the anti-democratic nature of capping and why it should be abandoned. Instead I shall pick up the points that the Minister made when he intervened in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham and said that the Government were seeking to achieve a system of finance in local government that was based on an assessment of need. That is the last thing that the assessment is based on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>801</span>
Again, I shall use the example of Bristol, a local authority covering my constituency and a number of others that make up Bristol. It is a non-metropolitan district with a population of 378,000, of whom 290,725 are poll tax payers. It was once a unitary authority. Bristol's budget for 1991–92 was £59.4 million. In 1990–91 the Government's rules meant that Bristol's spending would not be regarded as excessive unless its budget was more than £54.5 million. It would be designated for capping only if its budget exceeded £62 million. Bristol originally set a budget of £64 million, which was capped to £56 million. The budget was capped to a level below the spending level that the Government had considered acceptable the previous year. I repeat: one year Bristol's spending was considered acceptable by the Government, but the following year, because of the change in the criteria for capping an SSA, its budget was capped to a level lower than the acceptable budget of the previous year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the formula in 1991–92 Bristol's spending has been regarded as excessive if it was more than £46 million. In other words, the Government have told Bristol that it is overspending on a budget that is some £8.3 million less than the figure that they considered acceptable the previous year. That is crazy. How can the electorate hold local authorities accountable for their expenditure, when the decisions of the Department of the Environment do not make sense?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bristol lost heavily on the transfer from grant-related spending assessment to standard spending assessment. In 1990–91 the SSA for all shire districts rose by 11.2 per cent on the corresponding GREA levels for the previous year. However, Bristol's SSA was allowed to increase by only 1 per cent. The authority was capped for performing its functions as a properly elected, prudent, experienced and well-respected local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that SSAs were decided on the basis of social need. If we examine the big nine district councils—the family of authorities to which Bristol belongs—we find that for Bristol there was an allocation in grant of £140 per head of population. In Leicester, which is also in that family of authorities, the allocation per head of population was £237. In other words, the Government think that it cost 69 per cent more to provide services in Leicester than in Bristol, or that Bristol should be capable of providing the same services to a population profile that is supposed to be the same as Leicester's, for £90 less than Leicester. When it does not meet that impossible target, the local authority is capped and told that it is not allowed to be accountable to its electorate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What did the hon. Lady mean by saying that the population profiles of Leicester and Bristol were supposed to be the same? Supposed by whom and in what sense are they the same?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That the local authorities are in the same family group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>802</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says oh. The point is that the local authorities are traditionally grouped as similar bodies and that is no more unreasonable than many of the categories used by the Minister and the Department of the Environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people in Bristol do not believe that they control their local authority or that it is accountable to them. When they complain or ask why a service has not been delivered, the local authority says, "The budget does not permit us to provide it. We are poll tax capped, we have no money and we cannot respond to you." People are becoming disenchanted and alienated from a system that is important for sustaining democracy at all levels and in which we take such pride. They feel that they cannot participate, are not involved and have no control because whatever programmes they elect their local authorities to carry out, the Government construct formulae to prevent them proceeding with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a world turned upside down and it is very dangerous for the principles of democracy. The only logical way to proceed is to remove capping and make local authorities directly accountable to their electorates. We have elections once a year in Bristol, when a third of the council retires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been following the hon. Lady's speech carefully. If I understood her correctly, she said that the removal of capping would inject new life into people's interest in local government. I hope that she will enlighten me, as that would help me to reach a judgment. What percentages of the electorate turned out for elections during the last Labour Government's period in office and for those when the Conservative Government were in office? If she can provide that information, she may go some way towards persuading me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a little older than me and I am unable to provide the information that he requested about 1979. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> However, I believe that we would all agree that the level of participation in local authority elections leaves room for improvement. Regardless of our political views, none of us should be satisfied if we perceive the electorate as being so disenchanted that it feels that it is not worth participating in elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State for Wales and other Conservative Members said, from sendentary positions, that participation levels in local government elections have risen. Certainly, participation levels in elections for seats which have been uncontested have risen. The Under-Secretary would know that in the last local government elections in the Principality, more seats were uncontested than ever before in the history of Wales. That was largely the result of capping procedures and other restrictions imposed by the Government on local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the county of Avon, we have no uncontested seats. I have been a Member of Parliament since 1987. When I was elected, three of the 24 councillors were Conservative, the rest were Labour. The three Conservatives have since been

	<span class='label label-info column'>803</span>
unseated by an electorate who firmly reject the Government's policies. We are not what is commonly called a Tory-free zone. Every representative at every level—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady wishes to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have reached the final sentence of my contribution several times but then allowed several interventions. However, other hon. Members wish to speak. I shall conclude by saying that capping does nothing to enhance local democracy or accountability. Quite the reverse; it damages it. Capping controls local authorities and destroys their independence. It has nothing to do with the aspiration to ensure decent services at a decent cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>1.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee should be deeply grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis). In a remarkable achievement, he managed to extract from the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) an uncharacteristically frank and precise answer to an important question. That extraordinary answer was that a future Labour Government—if such a horror should ever exist— would deprive themselves of any mechanism for controlling local government expenditure. The hon. Member for Dagenham may wish to resile from that. If I were a Labour candidate at the next election, I should wish to resile from that. When we read 
	<i>Hansard</i> tomorrow, we shall find, in black and white, that, willingly or not, the hon. Gentleman gave the clear, unambiguous answer that my hon. Friend sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first consequence of that answer, the first conclusion that will inexorably be drawn, is that should there be a Labour Government, whatever the extravagance of local authorities and however cruel those authorities' impositions might be on their citizens, those citizens will get no relief whatever from the Government of the day. I shall make it my personal business at the next election to ensure that every elector in Stamford and Spalding is fully aware of what the hon. Gentleman said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, and a more serious matter for the future of our country should Labour ever form a Government, is that a future Labour Government would have no power to control the level of local authority expenditure. In practice, a future Labour Government would have no power to control the level of public expenditure as a whole. Under a putative Labour Government, public expenditure would not be controlled at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the 59th minute of this 11th hour, there is one way in which the hon. Member for Dagenham can extract himself from the bottomless pit into which he has fallen. I offer him a way out. Will he assure the Committee that, if local authority expenditure gets out of control, a future Labour Government will compensate for that by reducing pound for pound central Government expenditure on health,
	<span class='label label-info column'>804</span>
education, social security and so on? If the hon. Gentleman can give us such an assurance with the same clarity with which he answered my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, I shall happily concede that a future Labour Government would not necessarily lose control of public expenditure. If he does not give us that assurance, we shall scarify him at the next election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I enjoyed the earlier exchanges when Conservative Members cross-examined my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham, but I am shocked by the latest speech of the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding because, clearly, he did not listen to that cross-examination. I was surprised by his assertion that there would be no control over local government expenditure. I was pleased with hon. Friend's approach. A Labour Government will first restore trust. The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding referred to the breakdown in trust. It is about time that trust was restored between local authorities and the Government. Onslaughts have constantly been made on local authorities by the Government, who have shackled them with more than 50 Acts. Hon. Gentlemen have distrusted and hated local authorities for so long that they do not understand what I mean by trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman paints a wonderful picture of the day when the Labour party comes to power and old ladies and children dance in the street with tears of joy in their eyes. Perhaps on that day, the Labour party at national level will shake hands with those local Labour parties that it has sat on and crushed over the past few years because Walworth road has disagreed with them. What evidence of trust is there among relationships inside the Labour party to suggest that a trusting relationship between a Labour Government and Labour local authorities will exist, especially with high-spending Labour councils?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not go into that. The hon. Gentleman's intervention proved my point that Conservative Members do not know anything about trust because they have lived so long with mistrust and hatred. They cannot trust local authorities to undertake a single task. They cannot grasp the first concept of Labour philosophy, which is trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks us to trust local authorities. It is undeniable that, in the first year of the poll tax, the Conservative party foolishly trusted local authorities and the outcome of that trust was an excess spending over the rate of inflation of £2,500 million. That happened under the limited capping powers that existed then. Is the hon. Gentleman seriously arguing that a completed open-ended trust of local authorities would not produce an excess that was even greater than £2,500 million? Would that not blow out of the water any proper control of national public expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am just making my summary of that cross-examination. It was not open-ended only about trusts. If the hon. Gentleman will permit me, I shall
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>805</span>
come to its other aspects in due course. The poll tax was not a demonstration of trust in local authorities. That was an exercise in mistrust and in shackling local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a practical example of the Labour party's trust in local government. What does the hon. Gentleman say to the Lambeth Labour councillors who have been suspended by Walworth road and who no longer belong to the Labour group on the council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Goodbye.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what I would have said. Sir Michael, you referred to the hour before lunch as the happy hour, but perhaps this time of night should be called the capping hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government cannot conceive of a better relationship with local government, but that would be a good first step. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham was asked about circulars by the hon. Member for Bury (Mr. Burt), who wondered if a Labour Government would send them out. Of course they would be sent out to reinforce a direction—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A direction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps "direction" is the wrong word. We are so used to the Common Market that I used it instead of "guidance". Circulars make clear what central Government think about the direction—in inverted commas—in which local government should be going. I expect there to be a two-way process between a future Labour Minister and local authorities. My choice of words may suffer at this time of night, but I see nothing wrong with a frank exchange of views. I can imagine that local authorities will want to meet a future Labour Minister, who might well call some of them in for discussions. I like the idea of beer and sandwiches. What is wrong with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is typically generous in giving way again. May I enlighten him
	<span class='label label-info column'>806</span>
about the content of the circulars sent out by the previous Labour Government to my local authority in Bury; They directed the authority to reduce its expenditure on schools and social services to fit that Government's requirements. What is the difference between such a directive and whatever method of control of local government that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) may envisage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham said that a Labour Government would not adopt a regime of capping, which is what the hon. Member for Bury (Mr. Burt) means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next question is, "How does one get overall economic control?" My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham was asked during that cross-examination whether he would use the central Government grant to local authorities as a tool of overall economic control. My hon. Friend's answer was clear. Central Government would have to set the level of grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong, but a constituent of his recently told me that he had spoken on this subject with the hon. Gentleman. He said that the hon. Gentleman had said specifically that if a local authority such as Waltham Forest decided money had go be spent, a Labour Government would make funds available. The hon. Gentleman is a serious man. How much more Government grant would be made available by a Labour Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That certainly was not a conversation with me. That is not my view, but I would say that more grant would be available under a Labour Government than under a Conservative Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
