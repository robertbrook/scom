	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT MINISTERIAL AND OTHER SALARIES ORDER 1990</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. John Maples)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Ministerial and other Salaries Order 1990.</p></blockquote>
This was laid before the House on 13 November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall outline briefly our proposals, which this year are straightforward. As the Committee knows, under the terms of the resolution of 21 July 1987 parliamentary salaries will increase by 8½ per cent. on 1 January 1991. Our intention is that all Ministers and paid office holders in this House and the other place will also receive an increase of 8½ per cent. in their official salary from the same date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Tuesday 13 November, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, South-West (Mr. Page), the Lord President set out in detail in a written answer all the changes that would be made under the order. Ministers and paid office holders would receive cash increases varying from £1,359 to £3,974, depending upon' their office, in addition to the increase of £1,708 in the reduced parliamentary salary for House of Commons Ministers. The total increase in ministerial and paid office holders' salaries would amount to just under £265,000, which is equivalent to 8½ per cent. of the total pay-bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that these proposals represent an equitable and realistic settlement which would be entirely consistent with the Government's policy of pay restraint. For the past three years Ministers have received lower percentage increases than Members of Parliament. This cannot be sustained for too many years without eroding differentials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the draft order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.32 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was pleased to hear the Economic Secretary speak of differentials and their erosion. He said that ministerial salaries will be increased, probably in line with the level of inflation when the increase becomes due in January. We have no quibble with that proposal, but believe that these are important matters that must be gone into carefully. The Government have considered them properly on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one or two matters to put to the Economic Secretary. First, are the salaries of all those mentioned in the order increased, to the nearest pound, by 8½ per cent.? The salaries, unlike those of Members of Parliament, are not tied to any civil service grade, but we believe that there would be some advantage in having ministerial salaries set, after proper debate, and tied to such a grade. It would remove from the public arena an annual debate of this type; the House should, however still be involved in ministerial salaries and, as a corollary, opposition and back-bench Conservative Members must be able, when they feel it to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
necessary, to table motions reducing, or increasing, ministerial salaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I ask a financial question that involves Supply. We should like to move to a system whereby ministerial salaries increased automatically in line with those of Members of Parliament, but the Opposition were able to challenge that formula when they felt that there was good cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Back-bench Members may hold different views; if so, I should be interested to hear them. I am sure that the Economic Secretary would also be interested. Perhaps such contributions would help to cut the time taken in debate. We sometimes talk for too long in the House of Commons on many matters, and perhaps this is one of them. It is not up to me, but I would like to hear short, sharp comments, from my hon. Friends and from Conservative Back Benchers—if those Members can bring themselves to speak—in one minute or in two minutes' time. It would be useful for the present Government and for a succeeding Labour Government, to consider such comments if they have not been considered before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have taken cuts in their real salaries; not, I suspect, because they wanted to but because their mistress insisted. The Conservative party has now rebelled. The signs of rebellion are visible and will continue to be visible this week. The rebellion must have been caused partly by the realisation that people in work have seen a measurable and reasonable increase in their standard of living. Before anyone misinterprets that statement as my praising the Conservative party, the increase in other European countries has been much greater and there has been no increase in the standard of living in the past 11 years for those not in work in the United Kingdom. However, I do not wish to embark on a political argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is entirely right that unless there are well explained reasons to the contrary and the matter has been debated in the House of Commons, ministerial salaries should, by and large, increase at the same rate as those of Members of Parliament. I hope that the Committee does not challenge the draft order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.37 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Garrett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This draft statutory instrument, like so many others, contains the minimum of information. As the Committee is in a way responsible for the public purse, it is entitled to a more detailed explanation. I am disappointed by the lack of imagination that has been revealed in deciding the salaries. The Government have become obsessed with performance-related pay, which is paid to managers in the national health service and some of the agency services, and to some senior civil servants. But there is a distinct omission of that philosophy for ministerial salaries. I would like to think that if, for instance, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was on PRP, he would receive an accrued percentage of any reduction in the United Kingdom's contribution to the common agricultural policy which he secured. After the Westland affair, however, Ministers should have suffered a deduction in their salaries for mishandling the public purse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of us are familiar with the job descriptions of Ministers in the House of Commons. But under parts III and IV of Schedule I, we are asked to approve salaries of Law Officers and of those who serve in the House of Lords. We exercise power over the House of Lords to the extent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
that we have to authorise the expenditure. It is a money issue, over which the other place has no control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, like my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), want the sitting to be brief, because we have other engagements. Some hon. Members have an important job to do today—they have to vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the back of my mind is the thought that Opposition Leaders and Whips will suffer a partial reduction in their salaries as Members. How far is the reduction of their salaries as Members counterbalanced by the increases recommended in the order?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Economic Secretary cannot reply to all of my questions today, perhaps he will reply in writing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.41 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to a reply of 13 November in answer to a parliamentary question asked by the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West (Mr. Page). The reply provides more details than the statutory instrument, including details of the level of salaries for Leaders of the Opposition and others after reductions have been taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A footnote states that the Prime Minister and Mr. Speaker have elected to receive the same salary as a Cabinet Minister in the House of Commons. That means that the current Prime Minister has established the principle of differential payments for Prime Ministers. Other Prime Ministers may not wish to continue that arrangement, and may want to be paid what used to be the full salary, or another differential payment. Given that we might have a new Prime Minister this evening, it seems appropriate that. the candidates for that position should be consulted to ascertain whether they want to abide by the current Prime Minister's decision. We should consider what a reasonable salary might be for today's potential Prime Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine), for instance, is quite wealthy and might feel that he could do the job for no extra Prime Ministerial salary—or even for no salary at all. Indeed, if he were paid for productivity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are discussing not Back Bench Members' salaries but ministerial and other salaries. The hon. Member must confine himself to the terms of the draft order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall confine myself to the Prime Minister's salary, Mr. Hill. I suggested that if the right hon. Member for Henley became Prime Minister, his feelings should be considered, just as those of the current Prime Minister were. We should also take his performance into consideration. My hon. Friend the Minister for Wallsend (Mr. Garrett) referred to performance-related pay—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Garrett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather disappointed by the attitude of my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes). He and I are life-long trade unionists, and have fought all our lives for the principle of the rate for the job. He is now suggesting undercutting the rate for the job, which seems to be a negation of trade union democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's principles in terms of ordinary jobs, but we are discussing peculiar circumstances when referring to the salaries of Members of Parliament and Ministers, because some of them are full-time and some are part-time. For example, the record of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
right hon. Member for Henley shows that he has been very much a part-time Member. During 1988–89, he voted in less than 30 per cent. of the Divisions that took place. He never bucked the Government Whips in that period, despite his trying to appear as someone who is a radical in the current contest. Therefore, on that basis, the right hon. Member for Henley, if he were Prime Minister, should receive less than a third of the maximum salary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other contestants in the race. The Chancellor of the Exchequer wishes to establish a classless society. He may wish to consult my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South-East (Mr. Nellist), who takes only an average industrial wage. If a full classless society develops, it may be that Prime Ministers, Ministers and Members of Parliament will move towards an egalitarian principle. That principle could be propounded by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Prime Minister said that she will be a backseat driver in the new regime, and that role will obviously be much easier for her if the Chancellor of the Exchequer becomes the new Prime Minister. In those circumstances, perhaps we should consider paying the right hon. Lady an extra salary, which could be taken from that of the new Prime Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third candidate is the Foreign Secretary. We could follow different principles when deciding salaries, such as considering the rating of candidates in the eyes of the public. As a report today shows that the Labour party would win an election with a 22 per cent. majority over the Conservatives if the Foreign Secretary became Prime Minister, perhaps he should pay us rather than our paying him. The principle of what people should be paid was referred to by Marx—not Karl, but Groucho—who said, "Everybody has his price and I'll undercut them all." Perhaps the position of Prime Minister should be auctioned to discover who would do it at the cheapest rate, before it is decided who should be elected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.48 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maples</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) for saying that he has no quibble with the draft order. In answer to one of his questions, all the salaries referred to in it will be increased by 8½ per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggested that perhaps ministerial salaries could be tied to a civil service grade. That is an interesting idea which I do not believe has been considered seriously before, but it would certainly take the matter out of day-to-day or year-to-year politics. In past years, although not recently, Ministers' salaries have been referred to the Top Salaries Review Body, which is another way of handling the matter. However, I am grateful to the hon. Member for Wrexham for agreeing that the way in which to resolve the problem is to increase Ministers' salaries by the same percentage every year as that paid to Members of Parliament. The hon. Gentleman said that Ministers have taken cuts in the past. Although it would be in my interests to say that that was true, it is not quite true; we have taken lower increases than Back Bench Members of Parliament in the past three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Garrett) raised some interesting ideas about performance-related pay. The Conservative party is generally in favour of market rates for jobs, but I suspect that the market rate for being a Minister, or even a Member of Parliament, is negative and that there are perhaps 90 people around the country who would happily pay to be Ministers or who would even pay
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
to be Labour Members of Parliament. Perhaps the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) or the hon. and learned Member for Leicester, West (Mr. Janner) could raise the anti-vote against some of my hon. Friends, so I think that that suggestion leads us into dangerous territory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the criteria? Who would measure the performance? One of the salaries covered by the order is that of the Leader of the Opposition. If that were calculated on a performance-related basis, on which my hon. Friends had a right to vote, perhaps he would not receive £34,937. We may come to dangerous territory if we explore that idea too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order must be passed by both Houses of Parliament and may be debated in the other place. I agree that some of the job descriptions are archaic, and perhaps it would be a good idea to translate them into 20th century English. The Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms is the Government Chief Whip in the other place, the Treasurer of Her Majesty's Household is the Government Chief Whip in the House of Commons, the Captain of the Queen's Bodyguard is the deputy Chief Whip in the other place and the Lord in Waiting is a Whip in the other place—my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Sackville) tells me that that is an extremely difficult job and underpaid in view of the difficulty that the Government have had in getting various Bills through the other place during the past few weeks.

Members of Parliament are paid 89 per cent. of the, maximum on the scale for grade 6 civil servants. Ministers are paid 67 per cent. of the maximum on that scale plus their ministerial salaries. They receive sixty seven 89ths of a Member of Parliament's salary—next year that will be £21,809—plus the ministerial salaries set out in the order. That applies to all those specified in the order who are also Members of the House of Commons, not only Ministers

and Whips. The Leader of the Opposition and the chief and assistant Opposition Whips, whose salaries are covered by the order, will receive the parliamentary increment of £21,809.

The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) tried to take us along paths on which I choose not to follow him. I am not sure that he would make the same comments if he were speaking from the Government side of the Committee.

The intervention of the hon. Member for Wallsend was interesting and perhaps Ministers should call on his trade union experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Economic,Secretary for his comments. Such matters are best dealt with when a well understood scheme for increases has general acceptance and not partisan acceptance by only part of the House of Commons or part of society. If there is genuine acceptance throughout society—this applies to ministerial salaries and to the way in which people in all walks of life are paid—that will benefit the whole country. I hope that the Economic Secretary will accept my comments. The House of Commons should have the power to intervene and to table motions, but if the matter is taken out of the run of the mill so that we need not consider it every year, that will expedite Government conduct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
