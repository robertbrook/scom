	<p>10 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As this is only the second meeting of the Regional Affairs Committee under new Standing Order No. 117, I shall briefly summarise how the Committee's proceedings will unfold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We begin with a statement from the Minister on the matter referred to the Committee by the House on 5 December. That will be followed by questions on the statement, which may continue for an hour. We shall then move to a general debate on a motion moved by the Minister. Other hon. Members, including those representing English seats who are not one of the 13 core members of the Committee, can speak until I call the Minister to reply to the debate. At the conclusion of the Minister's speech, or at 12.30 pm, I shall put the question on the motion. We therefore begin with a ministerial statement on regional governance in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Cabinet Office (Mrs. Barbara Roche)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hood. I am pleased that the Committee is under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating an important subject. In preparing for the forthcoming White Paper on regional governance, we are listening to the views of those with an interest from across England. Today's debate is a key part of that process. Indeed, the Committee has an important role to play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past decade, there has been growing recognition that many issues—for example, planning and economic development—cannot sensibly be tackled at national level, but for which the areas covered by local authorities are too small. As a result, there has been a progressive growth in administrative structures and institutions at regional and sub-regional level; those changes are intended to address that diversity of needs and interests and to create a framework for regional development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Labour Government came to power in 1997, much has been done to bring greater strength and coherence to those arrangements. In 1999, we set up the regional development agencies. Their purpose is to co-ordinate regional economic development and regeneration, to enable the English regions to improve their competitiveness and to reduce the imbalances that exist both within and between regions. They have proved a great success, supporting thousands of regeneration schemes, skills projects and initiatives to assist business competitiveness. In their first year, the RDAs were responsible for creating or saving 35,000 jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recognition of that success, we have substantially increased the funding and flexibility of RDAs. In July 2000, they were awarded a substantial year-on-year increase in resources, worth £500 million extra a year
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
by 2003–04; and by April 2002, they will have more budgetary flexibility so that they can make the best use of those extra resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the RDAs outside London remain accountable to Ministers and to Parliament, we recognised from the outset the fact that they need to respect the views and needs of the regions that they serve. To that end, in 1999, the Government designated eight voluntary regional chambers to provide the main link between the RDAs and the regions. In July 2001, we announced a £15 million fund for those chambers, to enable them, over a three-year period, to enhance their scrutiny role of the RDAs and to develop their position as a strategic focal point for the regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increasing importance of the regional dimension has been further acknowledged by reinforcing the Government office network in the regions, and establishing more devolved regional planning arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not intend to stop there, however. Our manifesto committed us to regional government in those regions where popular support was demonstrated through referendums, and where there was predominantly unitary government. Led by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, in liaison with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions and other colleagues, we are working on the forthcoming White Paper on regional governance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last month, the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry published a pre-budget report called "Productivity in the UK: 3—The Regional Dimension". It stated that effective regional and local institutions were essential to building regions in which workers wanted to live and where successful business could flourish. It also stressed that regional and local flexibility could maximise the effectiveness of economic development policy, involving stakeholders and allowing better targeted policy delivery. The report concluded that the best mechanisms for dealing with regional issues were likely to be based in the regions themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that people in England deserve the opportunity to choose whether to have a democratically elected body that pulls together all the issues that affect their region, and that has the legitimacy, critical mass and clout to set priorities and speak up for the region. The regions outside London, where there are 40 million people, are now virtually the only regions in Europe that do not have some form of regional democracy or representation. Elected regional assemblies can put that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such assemblies can strengthen accountability. In the north-east, for example, there are 70 regional and sub-regional quangos. They are not accountable to the region, and most people do not know who is on them or what they do. Elected regional assemblies can change that. They can open up the system and provide regional stakeholders with a clearer decision-making framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elected regional assemblies will give people in the regions the chance to have a stronger political voice
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0566">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
and bring decision making closer to the people whom we represent. They can improve delivery by giving the regions the freedom and flexibility to meet their own needs and priorities within the national framework, and by co-ordinating the many activities and strategies that exist in the regions. It is clear that the country as a whole will only fulfil its potential if all the regions are successful. By making our regions stronger and enabling them to play to their strengths, we can in turn strengthen our nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are committed to an open and responsive democracy that meets the needs of the people and is held to account by the people. A programme of constitutional reform is well under way to achieve that aim. We are modernising the institutions of government and devolving power from the centre. Devolving power and strengthening democracy is central to delivering public services, modernising local government and bringing growth and prosperity to the regions. We have devolved power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and given London a democratically elected strategic body to promote its interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional governance White Paper will be the next step in the process of decentralisation. It will enable the creation of elected regional assemblies where people want them, which will strengthen our regions and in turn our country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr.Anthony Steen
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Totnes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a pleasure to see you, Mr. Hood, in any of your many roles. The subject on this occasion is not Europe, but the regions, and I wondered whether the two were connected and that was why you were our Chairman. During the previous Regional Affairs Committee, everyone shrank from saying that we were moving towards a regional White Paper, which the Minister has clearly referred to today. When is that White Paper likely to be produced? Will it deal with the imbalances in the regions? For example, the population in the south-west is concentrated in Bristol, Plymouth and Exeter, whereas the whole of Cornwall's population is probably smaller than that of those areas put together. The Minister talks about regionalism and decentralisation, but we could end up with decentralisation from the centre but total distortion in the regions, with people feeling far further away from the seat of government. Instead of having a county council based near them, they will have a regional council based hundreds of miles away. Will the Minister deal with that point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, will she say something about district and county councils? Will she be quite frank with the Committee and say whether town and parish councils will be retained or whether the Government plan to get rid of the lot? It would be helpful if the Minister would say what is in her mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough and Whitby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hood. Could you confirm that, at this point in our proceedings, hon. Members should put one question succinctly to Ministers to allow them to answer as many questions as possible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen) said that he was coming to a conclusion, but I
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
intended to emphasise that questions should be brief to allow more of them to be answered. Where possible, I ask hon. Members to co-operate with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hood. I thank you for drawing that matter to the attention of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order, but you are welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is clearly an incredibly courteous Committee, so I am delighted to play my part in it. With your permission, Mr. Hood, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and I propose to answer the questions from the perspective of our different responsibilities. The Cabinet Office has responsibility for the Government offices of the regional co-ordination unit, whereas my right hon. Friend has responsibility for local government. The hon. Member for Totnes raised several questions, so I shall respond to the first part of his remarks and my right hon. Friend will deal with the other points that he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about Europe is well made. Many regions of the UK have some form of dialogue or negotiation with the European Union. From my involvement, I have found that a regional voice can be important. For example, when we were negotiating structural funds, especially objective 1 funding, it was very useful for people in the south-west to be involved in that dialogue. The regions can be important in putting their views to the European Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Totnes mentioned the south-west. The RDA has been successful in addressing the needs of the south-west as a whole. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that that constitutes a big area, but the RDA has been able to apply a co-ordinated approach to some regional difficulties. He is also right to speak about regional imbalances. That is one of the driving forces behind the whole idea of regional government, which enables such issues to be raised and addressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. Nick Raynsford)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to the hon. Member for South Hams—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Totnes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. I was familiar with the old name for his constituency, and had not taken on board the new one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's first question related to the overall nature of the region—the population balance and various component elements. The second stage of his questioning was about how proposals for regional government might relate to existing structures of local government, particularly county councils and parish councils. I will try to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current definition of the Government office region is an extensive area that contains a number of population centres, not just those that the hon. Gentleman raised—Swindon is also a significant population centre. The region includes relatively densely populated areas and other relatively sparsely populated areas, but it is still seen as a region. A poll undertaken approximately two years ago found that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0567">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
between 80 and 90 per cent. of respondents identified themselves as living in the south-west region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is growing awareness of the south-west as a regional unit. However, that does not take away from the fact that there are elements within the region with a distinct local identity. It would be obvious to highlight Cornwall. The people of Cornwall consider themselves to be strongly bound together. As part of the development of our thinking we want to ensure that where a new region or regional assembly is established, it not only reflects the overall nature of the region, but respects the concerns of regional entities within that region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to turn to the issue of the structures of local government. Our manifesto commitment is to allow regions the opportunity, if they express the wish through a referendum, to have an elected regional assembly within a framework of predominantly unitary local government. The White Paper that we will publish next year will spell out our proposals on how we intend to honour that commitment. There are some regions where there is already a preponderance of unitary local government. In Yorkshire and Humberside, 89 per cent. of the population live in unitary authorities. That is a very different picture to that presented by the south-west. Slightly different approaches may be necessary to enable the different regions that want a regional assembly to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it quite clear, because there has been some misinformation about the matter, that there is no secret Government agenda to abolish county councils. We believe that it is important to examine the structure of local government, because there will be several tiers of local government if regional government is introduced and it is in all our interests that we should have efficient systems of governance. However, there is no secret agenda to abolish county councils. I want to get that straight and put it on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor will the role or powers of parish councils in any way change as a result of the introduction of regional governance. In the local government White Paper published last week, we set out our commitment to extending the opportunities for parish councils, particularly those that aspire to quality parish status, which will enable them to enjoy certain additional benefits and will enable them to serve their communities even more effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having appealed to hon. Members to be brief with their questions, I am duty bound to make a similar point to the Ministers. Standing Orders allow either Minister to answer a question, but I hope that we will not have two ministerial answers to every question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Joyce Quin
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gateshead, East and Washington, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my hon. Friend the Minister's statement, which will be well received in the part of the country that I represent. I agree with her that economic development should be the core function of the regional government process. However, I would like her to tell the Committee what other roles she
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
envisages for regional government, and how such government would be able to wield influence and channel its views to central Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been a great deal of discussion, and many proposals have been put to the Government. Ministers have been listening carefully to the arguments. The importance to economic development of planning on a regional basis is one of the issues that have been raised. Regional transport strategies have also been requested. A small strategic body has also been suggested, a key aspect of which would be some executive powers devolved from Whitehall. People in some parts of the country have raised the idea of civic partnerships as another way of engaging with regional governance and ensuring that regional and sub-regional stakeholders are engaged in the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Andrew George
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to be able to attend this sitting of the Committee. I apologise for not attending the previous sitting; three days before, my eldest brother died and I was taken up with matters to do with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue before the Committee is very important to me. I should like to think that questions that I have tabled have caused its sitting. I was keen that the Committee should consider other matters besides the White Paper, since other Departments' proposals—for strategic health authorities, for example—will clearly prejudice or influence the development of the pattern of devolved decision making in the regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard about planning and economic development powers, but it would clearly be better, in some spheres of power, for democratically accountable institutions to operate. Health is a good example. Often there is a cliff edge between hospital services and social services. If they were brought together under one authority—including those authorities that cater for the general standard of housing and welfare—preventive care, hospital care and community care could be planned together and managed in such a way that regional institutions as one body could take important strategic as well as local decisions about service delivery. Does the Minister agree?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman recognises that one of our objectives is to devolve power from central Government to the regions rather than to move local government powers upward to the region. We would not regard it as appropriate, for example, for the regions to take from local authorities the power of local service delivery. That is best carried out at local level. For that reason we envisage the primary responsibility for providing social services remaining with local government. However, the hon. Gentleman is right to raise the importance of a better connection between the delivery of health and social services. The Government are trying to achieve exactly that through primary care trusts and other mechanisms to bring bodies together and ensure a more integrated service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We envisage that the regional assemblies should have some overview of health matters. A parallel is found in the Greater London Authority, which is in

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
some respects a precursor to what we are considering. It is a city-wide authority, introduced to give governance to an area as large as any of the English regions. The mayor was given a role in relation to public health. I was pleased to attend a recent gathering at which the mayor brought together health experts from other cities to share their experience of the wider health dimensions that would be affected by a body whose focus was—in the case of London—city-wide. A similar approach might be possible within the framework set out in the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Riverside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that the small, strategic body to which he referred might not be meaningful enough to make a difference and to be attractive to people in the regions? Does she agree that the model for meaningful devolution in England should be closer to that of the Welsh Assembly than to that of the GLA? Recognising the importance of the knowledge economy to economic regeneration in the regions, does she intend to include a regional remit for the science research councils?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In considering devolution to Scotland and Wales, we should recognise that they are parts of the United Kingdom that have evolved very differently. The model is therefore much more akin to that of London. However, we shall listen to the views of hon. Members from all parties. A small strategic authority with some executive powers is the model towards which most people in the English regions with whom it has been discussed veer. I have visited the north-west twice recently. The majority of people whom I spoke to there favoured that model. I understand the point about science and the knowledge base. That is incredibly important to economic regeneration and economic development and has been so in the north-west. It is among the issues that we have to consider, and on which we shall be keen to receive representations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government share my concern that, as regional entities such as RDAs take on ever more influence and power—as outlined in our right hon. Friend's opening remarks—Members of Parliament do not have enough chances to talk about the specifics of developing policies in the regions? Does he share my concern that Members of Parliament do not have adequate opportunity to cross-examine and scrutinise members of the RDAs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will find that, as our policy develops and we publish our White Paper, there will be plenty of opportunity for hon. Members to become involved in debate and discussion about the role of the regions and the elected regional assemblies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Committee provides an opportunity for consideration of regional issues. Following the reorganisation of the machinery of government after the general election, the RDAs, are now the responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry. Questions relating to the work of RDAs could be raised with our right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry or in questions to his Department. If hon. and right hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Members would like to raise specific issues relating to RDAs during the proceedings of this Committee, we shall pass them on to the Department of Trade and Industry and will ensure that their questions receive proper and full answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Murphy
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wansbeck)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Recent analysis has suggested that it would require an extra £1.4 billion of public expenditure to raise the level of public spending in the north-east to match that of Scotland. Once the White Paper has been produced, does the Minister of State plan to discuss reforming regional finances to, if possible, extend the Barnett formula to the English regions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have no plans to revisit the formula, but I well understand the views on regeneration that have been advanced in the north-east. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and I recently spent time there discussing the issue with business people, local authorities and people in the universities. They told us that what they saw as regional governments were key economic drivers, which co-ordinated strategies in the region and should speak up for it. That is why there is a strong argument in the north-east for regional assemblies to take the agenda forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How obsessed are Ministers with their boundaries? To someone looking in from the outside, the north-east and Yorkshire appear to enjoy a settled will, and there is some satisfaction at the fact that they have internal integrity and a sense of identity. The boundaries seem to be more or less contiguous with community-defined boundaries. However, how obsessed are Ministers with the issue? Are they prepared to push it to the point where the whole devolution agenda fails because they are too inflexible to accept that other solutions might be more appropriate? Communities from Government-defined region might suggest a solution, and there could be a settled will within its boundaries and mutual recognition for separate regions that were prepared to work together. Would the Minister for Local Government prefer to a have a solution or to be presented with a problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are always interested in solutions—our primary objective is to find effective and successful solutions. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are neither obsessed with boundaries, nor inflexible. He will recognise, however, that opening up the issue of boundaries could lead to a long debate about precisely where they should be drawn, which would jeopardise the progress of the agenda to give regions the opportunity to elect their own regional assemblies. We must take a pragmatic approach to the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discussions that I have had about Cumbria in the north-west illustrate my point. Some elements in Cumbria feel a greater sense of identity with the north-east, but others, particularly in the southern part of the county, feel a greater affinity with the north-west. That encapsulates the problem. Opening the issue up could lead to an attempt to redraw a boundary within an individual county, and matters would begin to become complex. I ask the hon. Gentleman to bear in mind the difficulties and pitfalls
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0569">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
of pursuing the issue too enthusiastically, but I assure him that we shall approach it sensibly and pragmatically and that we are not inflexible or in any way obsessed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>John Mann
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bassetlaw)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The East Midlands development agency is pursuing a business-led, sub-regional partnership model. It is specifically changing the proposed number of elected councillors to create partnerships that are dominated by business. Is the Minister of State as comfortable as I am with that model?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, if it works. It is important that members are engaged in those partnerships. The regional development agencies are developing and creating an overall regional strategy and, as my hon. Friend said, partnerships at a sub-regional level. We know from our constituencies that different parts of the area that we represent will need different economic remedies and solutions. We have made it clear that the business element and leadership of RDAs is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which Department is taking responsibility for producing and promoting the White Paper? Is it the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions or the Cabinet Office? Given that an early draft of the White Paper must have been produced, will Ministers share their developing thinking on how directly elected regional assemblies will be funded and elected? Will they also share their view as to whether it may be possible for different directly elected regional assemblies to take on a different range of powers? Will variations in powers be possible between one assembly and another?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to wait for the publication of the White Paper for full answers, because we are only developing our thinking at this stage. However, in response to his interesting and significant questions, I can tell him that the responsibility to which he refers will lie with the Deputy Prime Minister, although it is an overall Government responsibility. The Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of State, Cabinet Office, the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry all have important roles to play. The White Paper will reflect the united view of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall set out our proposals on the funding arrangements, as we did in relation to Scotland, Wales and the city-wide government in London. Similarly, we shall propose a framework for election methods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of differential powers is interesting. As the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) will recognise, a degree of asymmetry is implicit in our proposals. We propose that regions should have the option of having an elected regional assembly if they choose to do so through a referendum. Some may chose to do so—we expect that they will—while others may choose not to. It is inherent that a pattern may develop whereby some regions have an elected regional assembly, while others
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
do not. Arrangements must ensure, therefore, that suitable systems are in place so that those regions that do not have elected regional assemblies can continue to benefit from various Government programmes through the existing machinery of the Government office for the regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, to ask whether there should be differential powers for different regions that choose to have an elected regional assembly is to go a bridge further. As the hon. Member for Bath will recognise, that might cause difficulties in terms of differential opportunities in various regions, and the matter needs our careful thought. As I assured the hon. Gentleman, we shall make clear our proposals in the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Joyce Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman), will my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Cabinet Office consider carefully the responses she receives about the size of regional governments? Does she agree that such bodies will need to be able to perform both executive and scrutiny roles, so that people will feel that the business of regional government is being monitored on their behalf? Does she also agree that, although the parallel with London is interesting, the debate actually relates to some large territories throughout the country, the geographical parts of which will need to feel involved in the regional government process? Finding ways of co-opting people and having an inclusive approach to regional government will be important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the important points that my hon. Friend makes. Being inclusive will be important, and all parts of regions must feel involved. That is why we are undergoing the essential process of listening to right hon. and hon. Members' comments, of which today's debate is an important part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister for Local Government said that the Government were in the business of finding solutions, but he must realise that it is no good having solutions until one knows what the problem is. When he explained how many Ministers would be involved in regional government, I realised what the problem was: with so many Ministers involved, it is like the Tower of Babel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole thing is simple: the Government want to get off the hook by handing down money and jobs for the regions, without specifying exactly their aims. By handing over a whole chunk of money and responsibility to the regions and creating another huge layer of bureaucracy to manage it, Ministers in Westminster will have an easier time, because they will have much less to do. Is that the Government's thinking? It would be helpful to Committee members with limited intelligence if they were given such a simple answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple answer is no. I shall elaborate briefly. We are interested in finding solutions to the problems, the first of which is the sense in several regions that decision making is too remote and that people do not have a sufficient influence on matters of predominantly regional concern. Secondly, several of the bodies discharging responsibilities are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
quangos that are in no way answerable to regional communities. There is a case for creating a more democratic and accountable framework in which people in the regions can have greater influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister of State alluded to the fact that some people in the regions believe passionately that the economic performance of regions can be improved by a greater focus and a co-ordination of those policies relating to economic development, planning and transportation and other relevant issues that need to be considered together to ensure effective regional development policies. It is certainly our objective that the creation of elected regional assemblies will help those processes. We do not intend to offload responsibility; we are a listening Government, who seek to respond to the legitimate aspirations of those in different regions who want more regional control over regional decision making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to develop an earlier question for the Minister of State. The Regional Affairs Committee is established under Standing Order No. 117, which allows us to meet with regularity and urgency. Almost six months have passed since we last met—I believe that we met on the eve of the general election, although I may be wrong about that. Given that the Minister is limited by her brief, it might be appropriate in the new year for her colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry to discuss with the Committee their view of the work being done on regional government. If she agrees, will she make those representations to her colleagues in the DTI?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, it would be impertinent for me to tell the Committee what its business should be, and which Ministers it should invite. I am sure that any of my right hon. and hon. Friends would be delighted and extremely willing to take part in its proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How obsessed are the Government with size? The English might be a little obsessed with it. Whenever the issue of boundaries and size arises, it is treated almost as though boundaries have been preordained by God. The right hon. Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Joyce Quin) suggested that the matter should be open to scrutiny, and I agree. The reflection of identity by devolved assemblies is surely a matter of such paramount importance that it should be included in the equation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To what extent have the Government considered models in other countries? I know that they have done so. Have they recognised that such models are successful not only where there is asymmetry, but where the relevant Government take a flexible approach and acknowledge that devolution cannot be established on a uniform and sanitised basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are no more obsessed with size than with any other issue, as I made clear to the hon. Gentleman earlier. The elected regional assemblies should be fit for purpose. That is the key criterion. He made a perfectly reasonable and sound case—my right hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West also made the point—for ensuring adequate representation of a region that contains diverse areas. That is one consideration, but the other
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
side of the coin relates to the point made by the hon. Member for Totnes, who accused us of possibly creating bureaucracy on a huge scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One person's representative body is another person's bureaucracy, and we must judge what is the right size for an assembly to enable it adequately and properly to reflect the communities that it represents, without creating an overly large bureaucracy and talking shop. We shall approach that balance in a pragmatic and sensible way, and listen carefully to the views expressed. I hope that the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George) will recognise that we are not obsessed; we want to find the right solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned models from other countries. We are considering them. He referred to asymmetry, and we are conscious that the Spanish model for devolution has an extremely asymmetric pattern, and some parts of it have been successful. Most people would recognise that the creation of a devolved framework for Catalonia has greatly helped relations between it and the rest of Spain, while, sadly, the Basque province has not been a happy model of successful devolution. We shall try to learn from other countries without aping any specific model. We want to do what is right for this country and to create structures that will work well here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister recently visited my constituency for a conference, so he will know how important transport connections are to it and other peripheral areas around regions. In terms of the regional governance proposed, will there be an element of devolution in transport policy, so that there can be local and regional prioritisation? If so, perhaps the A64 could be sorted out at last, which my constituents would welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to tell my hon. Friend that I visited his constituency by train rather than by the A64. I enjoyed the particularly beautiful journey from York, through the lovely valley with abbey ruins, and on from Malton to Scarborough. It was a delightful rail journey, and I am pleased to say that the train was punctual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raises an important matter. It is certainly our intention that elected regional assemblies should be involved in transport matters. Transport planning is crucial to economic development and to the well-being of communities. It will ensure that areas that currently do not benefit from the economic opportunities that they might otherwise enjoy have links with other areas, which will help transform their economies and make it easier for people to move within regions. However, for full details my hon. Friend will have to wait for the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister on his sensible use of public transport. However, I am slightly critical of both Ministers. They have both said that our meeting today is an important part of the consultation being undertaken in preparation for the White Paper. So far, we have been told that boundaries are important but that opening them up could jeopardise progress towards regional assemblies. We have been told that the idea of variable powers is interesting, but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0571">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
that to pursue it could be a bridge too far. We have been told that we must wait for the White Paper to discover the Government's thinking on funding, and we have been told to wait for the White Paper for their thinking on election arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that both Ministers have said that this Committee is an important part of the consultation process, would they at least speculate with us on what they think might possibly be included in the White Paper in respect of any one of those four issues? I leave it to them to choose which of the four they want to speak about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman offers every temptation, but I shall not be so discourteous to Parliament as to speculate. I am sure that, on serious reflection, the hon. Gentleman would not do so either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the White Paper is important, but it is also important that my right hon. Friend and I listen to the serious questions being put about size, functions, powers and economic regeneration. That is why we are extremely pleased to be part of the proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Joyce Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both Ministers have been asked a number of questions about boundaries. Do they agree that the boundaries proposed are useful, but that they are not meant to be prisons; that there is no reason why neighbouring regions should not co-operate with each other on issues such as transport links; and that there is no reason not to have sub-regional strategies to deal with areas with a distinct identity or distinct problems?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, my right hon. Friend makes an important point. Government offices are already working together on issues that cross the boundaries between them. In the same way, local authorities are increasingly working together to tackle common problems. The point that my right hon. Friend makes is extremely valuable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I thank the Ministers for their frank and helpful answers. They have been informative and useful. The shape of the Committee is a useful precedent; indeed, it could be written into the White Paper that it might a good way to run regional government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two small questions. First, I used to be chairman of a group of Conservative Members who represented seats in the west country, an area that stretches from Swindon to Penzance in the west and to Bournemouth in the south. That area has no community of interests. Swindon does not feel part of the south-west, and Penzance is very different from Bournemouth. How big a region is, and what is included in it, is much more significant than the Minister may want to admit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will we have regional Ministers? Will we have eight regional chief executives? Will we have sub-Ministers for each Department? Will we have a huge new structure of Ministers and sub-Ministers, giving us sub-Ministers for the west country? Is that the idea?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his kind words about the contributions of my hon. Friend the Minister of State and myself. I agree that the Committee is a useful forum and I appreciate his appreciation of our answers. By contrast, the hon. Member for Bath was a bit curmudgeonly in his attitude. I well understand the concern of the hon. Member for Totnes if he has to deal with the identity crisis of the Conservative party in the south-west.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a growing sense of the south-west region. In my earlier answer, I said that the Government recognise that there are certain elements in the region with a distinct sense of separate identity. However, I referred to polling evidence that implied that between 80 and 90 per cent. of the population of the region saw themselves as living in the south-west region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Steps are being taken through regional development agencies and other initiatives to help economic development in the region. We intend to be sensitive to concerns about separate sub-regional identities and the need for a framework. My hon. Friend the Minister of State made exactly that point in response to earlier questions. We are not approaching the matter in a rigid way; we are working with the building blocks that are already in place. The Government office regions exist for the purpose of exercising government, and it would be odd to start without considering that as a basic building block.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about sub-Ministers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I did not respond to the hon. Gentleman's final point about Ministers and sub-Ministers. It is not our intention that such offices should proliferate. Our purpose is to extend the opportunity to have a directly elected assembly to those regions that wish to have one. That assembly would then become a body with an important function in relation to such regions. As I said, the framework is permissive—some regions are likely to opt for it, but others may not. We shall need a machinery of government that ensures that there can be proper relationships between the Government and the regions, whether or not they have regional assemblies. That will be part of the subject matter of our White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>John Mann</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to return to the question of cross-border issues. An example is the proposed Finningley airport, the site for which is 400 yd from my constituency in Yorkshire, and which has been opposed vehemently by the majority of people in the east midlands. I live 15 minutes from Finningley airport and one and a half hours from east midlands airport. The second example is the strategic health authority. My health authority is lumped in with Yorkshire, rather than with the east midlands. How will such issues be handled in the White Paper?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all have similar examples from our own constituencies. It is important to return to our earlier discussion and the points made by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government. We approach the issues sensibly. Whatever the regional boundaries, it will be essential for people to discuss such issues across them, because issues such as an airport or an economic development strategy do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0572">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
necessarily stop at the regional boundary. It is important that such an approach is adopted after any regional government is established. It is also important to implement sub-regional economic strategies, which can sometimes straddle areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the theme of my questions so far has been obsessions, does the Minister share my obsession that the introduction of regional government should be triggered by a referendum? If so, what is required to trigger a referendum? For example, 50,000 people in Cornwall have signed sheets calling for such a referendum. They have been sent to the Minister for Local Government and the Regions and verified in the local records office. What percentage of the population will have to call for a referendum in order to trigger one to bring about regional devolution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. No decision has been taken and we shall set out our conclusions in the White Paper. There are several possible options. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the petition submitted by people from Cornwall. One option would be a requirement for a certain proportion of the population of a region to submit a petition to trigger a referendum. Another would be for one of the bodies that already exist in the regions—probably the chambers that have been brought into existence to monitor and oversee the work of RDAs—to submit a proposal for a referendum, possibly after a defined form of consultation to ensure that views within the region had been canvassed. We are considering other proposals and our response will be based on the principle that there must be a demonstrable wish within a region for an elected regional assembly for that to happen. That is why we require a referendum. We do not wish to start the process on a whim, without clear evidence of a wish to proceed to a referendum that will determine the will of the region.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for calling me, Mr. Hood. It is an unexpected pleasure. I apologise to you and to the Committee that I have to leave shortly to attend to other responsibilities in the House. As the time for questions has come to an end, may I use this opportunity to make a few points? Although I shall not be able to hear the Minister's response, I am sure that my hon. Friends will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed in the use by the Minister for Local Government of the word curmudgeonly, not because it may not have been deserved, but because my hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) and I have been attempting to spell it and find that we are unable. We shall look with great interest at the 
	<i>Official Report</i> for clarification. I see that the Minister is now having a go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
The Minister, his team and the Government share the view of Liberal Democrats that regional government is of vital importance for England. Its time has come and it is important to proceed in a way that has genuine popular support in each of the regions where it is to be established. We agree on the broad principles. I know that one of the key arguments of many who are critical of the development of regional government is the notion that the introduction of regional government would produce a huge additional tier of bureaucracy and cost. I hope that the Minister shares my view that that is an erroneous position. The introduction of regional government will not only solve the obvious problem of the democratic deficit, in that many regional decisions are being made over which people in the regions have no control; many unelected bodies are responsible for making those decisions, underpinned by a huge range of bureaucratic procedures and run at considerable cost. We very much hope that the many quangos will be swept together into regional government, and that that will significantly reduce costs and bureaucracy. The argument used by some people that regional government constitutes an additional tier of bureaucracy and cost cannot be proven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In developing the White Paper, I hope that the Government will give serious thought to the future role of the Government offices for the regions. I know that some people, including some in my party, believe that once regional government has been introduced, there will be no need for Government offices for the regions. I believe that once we have established what the powers of regional government will be, it will still be helpful to have a body of government at regional level to act as the point of contact between regional and central Government in respect of several national Government powers. Therefore, the powers and responsibilities of the Government offices for the regions will clearly change, but I hope that the Ministers will agree with me that those offices should continue but with different powers and responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither of the Ministers was prepared to give us their views about the method of election for regional government. However, it has been the view of the Labour Government that there should be a system of proportional representation—a fair voting system—in Wales and Scotland, as already exists in Northern Ireland and in the regional government for London. I hope that when we eventually see the White Paper, it will contain proposals for proportional representation as the basis for the election of members to the regional assemblies. It would be interesting to hear what sort of size the Government envisage that the elected bodies will be. I am sure that the Ministers and I share the view that they should be large enough to fit the purpose but no larger, but that still leaves the difficulty of deciding on a number. We will shortly produce our own White Paper on that very issue, so the Ministers will have to wait to see what figure we recommend. I suspect that our White Paper will be published sooner than the Government's.

It is also important to deal with the issue of funding, and it is disappointing that the Government have said nothing so far about that. I presume that, in the early stages, some form of block grant will be considered based on needs, perhaps involving the development of the Barnett formula to cover all the regions and nations of our country. Presumably, in addition, there will be other sums of money from various quangos in a region. In due course, we will be interested to discover whether the assemblies will have tax-raising powers.

The importance of regional government cannot be stressed too much. It is disappointing to many people that we have had to wait so long for progress. We are delighted that at last the Government appear to want to pursue the matter with greater speed than has been apparent in the past five years. Although we may disagree about some of the details—which we hope to have opportunities to discuss in the next few months—we assure the Government of our full support for driving forward the principle of regional government, provided that, first, they stick rigidly to their commitment that it will not be imposed on the people of any region, but will be based on their wish for it, and, secondly, that it will, as the Minister for Local Government has said, take on powers devolved downwards from central Government and not taken up from local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice from the monitor that my hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Mr. Wyatt), who is unable to attend the Committee today, is continuing the important debate on regionalism. A debate on the Barnett formula is under way in Westminster Hall as we speak. If anything underpins my enthusiasm for progress on regional government and improvement in the economic dimension of regionalism, it is the long history of the Barnett formula. There is a desire in the north-east for redress as to the distribution of funds and facilities to enable our communities to be developed, reinvented and regenerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the time is right for regional government and I welcome the comments of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster); it is a pleasure to follow him. In a previous debate I followed the right
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). The similarities in our approach to regional government are reflected in the types of communities that we represent. If this place is to be relevant and advance in the new century it must be seen to be relevant and to produce results for the communities that we serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important town of Whitby is the second largest community in my constituency. It is 40 miles from anywhere. It is isolated and—particularly on account of the 18 years under the Conservative party—was left very much to its own devices. Little progress was made and there was little opportunity for development in the key matters of training and education, or for a reinvention or regeneration of the principle infrastructure of the town. The fishing industry failed. The best that Whitby could offer was exported. Many children, on reaching 18, were forced to leave Whitby forever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agenda that I hope regional government will pursue will enable people to fulfil their aspiration to stay in Whitby and lead a good, useful and economically beneficial existence there, and I look forward to that. Above all else, as the hon. Member for Bath pointed out, that can be delivered only with the will of the people, alongside the key proposition. That is why the key element of the White Paper—at least, as how I understand it, although it has not been revealed to the Committee—is to conduct a referendum to test regional opinion. When the time is right, each region will move on. I firmly believe—this is important not least for the aspirations and hopes of the people of Whitby—that my region of Yorkshire and Humber will be one of the first to use the blueprint that will emerge from the ongoing debate on regional government. If there is no feeling of stakeholding and no public support for this important programme of regional government, the whole project will be damaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the hon.

	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention, which brings me to a point that I was going to make later. I pay tribute to Jane Thomas and the Campaign for Yorkshire, which has done such sterling work on the convention approach that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. I am pleased to have been part of the debate on that issue over the years, along with members of other political parties in the region, including, I have to say, the Conservatives. Voluntary groups have also been involved. The will of the people of Yorkshire has been manifested in those important debates, and the campaign has produced what it refers to as a white paper, which discusses the needs of Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the main string of my argument, Whitby was affected by the awful scourge of foot and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
mouth. It is the largest market town in a large hill farming area where agricultural businesses typically have margins of £6,000 to £7,000 a year. Local communities were particularly badly hit by the effects of—[

Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen), it has felt like Groundhog day because I have heard the same points over and over again. The Committee is about taking the agenda forward, not going backwards. My constituents in Whitby and Scarborough will read 
	<i>Hansard</i> and reflect on the attitude that the hon. Gentleman so clearly expressed. They will be reminded of why they so earnestly turned their backs on generations of Conservative representation. Typically, Conservatives in my part of the world have not listened to the community, which is why I am here trying to put its case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the important issue of the damage that foot and mouth has done to communities around Whitby, especially in the Esk valley. That relates not only to agriculture, but to tourism in such tightly drawn communities. Foot and mouth was more than a plague, as it damaged the important sense of community. My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) recently secured an Adjournment debate that reflected on the damage done to youth hostels in areas with national parks, such as my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers and people with small businesses in my constituency have reflected on the responsiveness of the national framework to foot and mouth in Scotland, especially in the Scottish borders, and on the ability of mechanisms of governance in Scotland. The Scottish Parliament is a more tightly drawn form of Government. My constituents feel that the problem was on the doorstep of the Scottish Executive, which was why the scourge of foot and mouth was clamped down on far more effectively and quickly in the Dumfries region than in Cumbria and North Yorkshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman makes that point. I make another point more earnestly: in my view and that of my constituents, the fact that the veterinary service was effectively closer to border areas meant that the response was far quicker. That is important to not only agricultural problems, but the rural tourism agenda. My constituents have suggested that if the approach in Yorkshire had been on the basis of regional government, the veterinary and tourism services might have been able to respond more effectively and the problem would not have gone on so long. I do not want to go on so long either, so I shall bring my contribution to a close soon, as I know that colleagues want to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is crucial for many communities such as Whitby that are peripheral to the rest of the nation. Something like £18 billion is spent in the Yorkshire and Humber region through national Government and Government offices, which is the traditional approach. We have made a considerable step in the establishment of Yorkshire Forward, the RDA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister of State on the work that she and her predecessor have undertaken in establishing a more regional identity through the Government office for Yorkshire and the Humber in Leeds. People from that office come to our communities, and are discernibly involved in trying to solve problems such as those about the recent and unfortunate proposed closure of the Plaxton bus factory in Scarborough. The quality of input from the civil servants of that office added to the recovery plan and gave a strong grounding on the type of work that could be achieved with a more focused regional approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I ask for is a greater opportunity for people in region such as that of Yorkshire and the Humber to feel that they have a complete stakeholding in what is done on their behalf. I want a transparent approach. I want the people of Whitby to have the same opportunity to approach their local member of the regional assembly—or whatever the people of Yorkshire choose to call it—as they do to approach their Member of Parliament. The need for scrutiny is crucial, as is the need to ensure that regional government not only considers the real problems, but attends to them. If, in the few months following the Christmas recess, we undertake the exciting approach that I look for in the White Paper, not only my constituents in Whitby but even the constituents of the hon. Member for Totnes will feel that Parliament is at last attending to business, and sorting problems out rather than creating them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both Ministers will be aware that I am a profound opponent of regionalism. It is directly contrary to the interests of my constituents, and I am fearful of what the Government might propose in the White Paper. The Ministers are not only honourable Members; they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
are also likeable, decent and intelligent human beings. However, they both come from London, so the debate has taken on a London focus. I can understand that London should have a coherent identity, and I can understand it for Yorkshire or the north-east, but the way in which they are trying to fit the rest of the country into that arbitrary model frightens me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the answer to a question is more politicians, then the wrong question has been asked. That is exactly what is proposed. In my part of the world, we shall have six tiers of government. They range from the parish and town councils, which are hugely important, to district and county councils, a regional assembly, Parliament and the European Parliament. My constituents are already confused about where they should go to get particular issues dealt with; how much more confused they will be if this wretched idea comes to pass.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea has been floated that the bodies already operating at regional level will come under the control of the regional assembly. I say either that those bodies are already accountable to us in Westminster or that they should be abolished because they serve no useful purpose. We do not have them under control; their functions need to be farmed out again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
West Midlands Arts is a dreadful organisation that spends more money on glossy annual reports and consultants than on helping the arts in the west midlands, and every arts body that I know of in the area would dearly love to see the back of it. It does not need to be made accountable; it should disappear. The same applies to Advantage West Midlands, the regional development agency. Despite the fact that it is now under better management, the powers exercised by that RDA should be exercised by the county councils and unitary authorities that already operate in the west midlands, and not by the wretched new bureaucracy that operates from offices in Birmingham. We should abolish those organisations and give their powers and resources—in other words, money—to the unitary authorities and county councils. Those latter bodies are already in place and are the true communities of interest in my part of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister assured us about the future of counties. He seduced some Conservative councillors in Worcestershire into believing that his reassurances can be trusted, but I do not believe him. The Government are already stripping counties of their planning and education powers. Post-16 education has already gone to the wretched learning and skills councils, which are in a state of administrative chaos in my part of the world. The funding for those councils is causing huge problems for the Government; the money is being taken from local education authorities and distributed to the new councils, but it has been done clumsily, which has resulted in additional money being paid to Worcestershire to compensate for the top-slicing. The learning and skills councils are now moving on to post-14 education and will take over vocational GCSEs—again, from LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
LEAs are being abolished by stealth. Planning authorities are already going as part of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Government's declared plans. Social services, the other major function of county councils, are being merged into health authorities—that function, too, is being killed by stealth. A case could be made for that—it may be sensible—but the incoherence between health and social services has been a real problem, which has prevented the delivery of quality in that public service. If planning, education and social services go, what will be left for the county councils to do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a two-stage process. The people of the west midlands will be offered a referendum on the basis that they can keep the county councils; but a few years later, when the county councils have withered on the vine, they too will be scrapped. We should be under no illusion that the Ministers' promises cannot be relied on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that in Torbay, Brixham, in my constituency, has always been regarded as the poor neighbour of Torquay and Paignton? There was a tremendous build up of belief there that there should be a referendum for a local town council. That referendum took place three years ago, and the general expectation was that there would be overwhelming support for Brixham town council. Less than 8 per cent. of the electorate voted, and Brixham town council no longer exists. Does my hon. Friend agree that, in the case of an assembly or regional government, a high figure—over 50 per cent.—should have to vote? Otherwise, officials could vote in a regional government just by force of numbers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad that I gave way to my hon. Friend. He has led me to my next point, which is the referendum. It is important to get that right. How will the referendums be conducted? What will the trigger mechanism be? The Minister offered few clues during the question-and-answer session. I have a problem in my constituency—I hope to discuss it during the Adjournment debate tomorrow—in that parish polls are being called, at great cost to the town council, on the wishes of 10 people out of a population of 20,000. Those polls are a complete irrelevance and a waste of time. Therefore, there must be a high threshold for trigger mechanisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be a right of veto for the shire counties around Birmingham and the black country against the creation of a west midlands regional assembly against their wishes. I can envisage a situation in which a small turnout in Birmingham votes for the regional assembly and the shire counties such as Herefordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Staffordshire vote against, but the total vote brings in a regional assembly, over the heads of the people who live in my constituency and nearby.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0576">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
My other worry is the cascading technique, which the Government used in Scotland and Wales. There would be no devolved assembly in Wales if the referendums had been held on the same day. The Government deliberately staggered the referendums in order to engineer the "correct" vote in Wales. I am fearful that the same thing would happen here. There has been a strong call for a long time for a regional assembly in the north-east—I shall explain in concluding how that can be addressed without the need to create regional assemblies. However, that area will vote, then Yorkshire will vote, and it will roll on down, and the west midlands might feel that it has to have an assembly because otherwise it will lose out. That is a gerrymandering technique. It is not honest and open; it is fiddling with democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no call for a regional assembly in the west midlands. In my 10 years as a Member of Parliament, I have barely had a single letter asking for a regional assembly—I might have had one. People are breathless at the thought that they might be run from Birmingham; that is the fear in Worcestershire. We love Birmingham. It is a huge, dense urban core, a city of which we are proud to be neighbours, but we do not want it to run our affairs. It took 30 years to get a regional hospital in Worcestershire because the regional health service was based in Birmingham and Worcestershire was, frankly, off its radar screen. That was a problem of regionalism. It was only when we got away from that that we had a chance of building a decent hospital for the county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are used to working with Gloucestershire—the three-choirs festival is based on the cathedrals of the three counties Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. There is a three-counties showground for agricultural purposes—Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire. Naturally, we would work with Gloucestershire, but that county is to be in the south-west region. There are bits of Gloucestershire that lie to the north of my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, Broadway sticks out like an arm into the Cotswolds. Broadway would be run from Birmingham, yet villages like Willersey, to the north, will be run from Bristol, together with Penzance and the Isles of Scilly, whose Member of Parliament is on this Committee. We need to work with Gloucestershire, not with Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regional assemblies might be what Labour politicians want, with their neat ideas of bureaucracies and new government structures, or what Liberals want because they think it might give them a bit more power here or there—although I hope that the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George) has severe reservations as to what the implications of all this are for Cornwall—but they are not what ordinary people want. Regional assemblies will not remove confusion; they will add it. They will not create clarity; they will remove it. They will increase the numbers of politicians, and will lead eventually to the abolition of county councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a couple of radical thoughts for the Minister. If the assemblies will genuinely take powers only from this place, we should make Members of Parliament
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
who represent those parts of the country the members of regional assemblies. That would require no extra elections. For a couple of days each week or for a week each month, we could go to Birmingham, for example—that would be the destination in my case—and sit on the regional assembly. The rest of the time, we would come down here. There would be no extra politicians. That solution offers clarity and, although it is radical, the Minister might consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If regions such as the north-east want a regional assembly, they should be able to have one de facto, and be given extra powers and resources. The economic development functions exercised by RDAs should all be in the hands of county councils and unitary authorities, which could band together in whatever way they thought appropriate. Just as we have combined authorities for fire and police services, there could be an economic regeneration service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regions should be allowed to do that. We do not need Acts of Parliament or new levels of bureaucracy—the Government could simply give county councils and unitary authorities the money and power to gang together as they think fit. In my part of the world, we would gang together not with Birmingham but with Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. That would make an effective little unit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I want to make a specific and general point. My mailbag is bulging, and so is my website—if a website can bulge—with mail from many people on many issues, but none of those communications has been an e-mail, letter or petition calling for more governance. I may not be the most popular person with my constituents, some of whom may regard me as a half-wit. In considering how best my area should be governed, to take one half-wit and add another half-wit will not create a full-wit, because a half-wit times a half-wit equals a quarter-wit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the principle of regional assemblies, if that is what people want, but the crucial issue is what kind of threshold there is and how wide it should be. A constituency such as mine looks not to the east midlands but to Yorkshire; we have Yorkshire television and radio, and Yorkshire commuters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers may want to consider the history of the trade union movement when they examine the question of boundaries. There are a myriad of different regional boundaries across the trade unions in England for which regional democratic structures have existed for 100 years. The General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union, the Transport and General Workers Union, and Unison—or NUPE, as it was known—all had different regional boundaries. In my constituency, a member of Unison will be in the east midlands and a member of the TGWU will be in Yorkshire, but not Yorkshire and Humber, although someone in Peterborough—to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0577">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
east—will belong to that region. Lincolnshire is in the Yorkshire region of the TGWU. For the GMB, Humberside and Hull comes under the east midlands. Those boundaries were created because of economic structures and perceptions of where trade and job links lay. Some attention should be paid in the White Paper to regional union structures, because it is an illuminating subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who live on the boundary of a region should have as much say as those who live in the core. Therefore, the threshold should not be simply in terms of numbers but should cross constituencies. If those in the extremities of the region felt that regional government was a step forward, I would welcome that, as strategies for control over the police, regional development agencies, fire services, transport and tourism would be far more coherent on a regional basis than on a national, district or county basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the role of Back Benchers. Where within the structures will Back Benchers be given the ability to scrutinise the bodies? I suggest that there should be Select Committees of the regions in this place, if not instead of regional government, perhaps in addition. The people running the various authorities could then be called together. That would benefit democracy, accountability and efficient government, and be a major step forward for delivery of Government priorities, as dictated by votes in this place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main point is on the question of over-governance. Instinctively, despite the reticence that I mentioned, the principle of regional government appeals to me, but over-governance does not appeal. Luckily, there are no mayors in my patch, and I hope that that remains the case—it certainly will if I have anything to do about it. However, we have parish and district councils, county councils and elections to Parliament and Europe. Some would want us to have elections to a second Chamber, although I think that that would be an election too far. I would simply scrap the second Chamber in its entirety and replace it—perhaps with a committee of the regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want fewer and fewer voters turning out for more and more elections. Throughout the last century, the maximum number of elections was four, which was probably too many; in the final calculation, we may end up with seven or eight elections. The Minister said that there was no secret agenda to abolish county councils—indeed, it should not be secret. I support regional government, and believe that we should scrap county councils in advance of creating regional government. There is no role for both in my area. Regional governance would be a step forward only on the basis that county councils were scrapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might scrap Nottinghamshire county council as an experiment, for example, in preparation for regional government. It would be a major step forward for my area to make schools directly funded and accountable, with head teachers running secondary schools and a family of primary schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Lawrie Quinn), I have raised the issue with county councils, much to their disgust. The issue is fundamental. More governance will not be better governance; it will not mean more delivery. We want delivery, which is what determines the Government's second-term agenda, and rightly so, but that will be hindered by an additional layer of government. I appeal to the Government to bite the bullet: let us scrap county councils if we are to move towards regional government—if that is the wish of the people—but let us do so in advance and not afterwards. We must demonstrate that leaner government is more effective than fatter government. That is my creed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. It is important because, although we are not being told much about the contents of the White Paper, there must be an opportunity for scrutiny of the Government's policies towards the regions. That is why I am disappointed that the Committee, being part of the unfinished business of the devolution of Scotland and Wales, has not sat more often. I gave the example earlier of the Department of Health's proposals to establish regional strategic health authorities. As the hon. Member for Bassetlaw showed, that clearly impinges on the way in which subsequent decisions are made about the boundaries, functions and modus operandi of regional assemblies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we do not see the Committee as merely a sounding board for Government policy on the establishment of regional assemblies. There are many other issues affecting the delivery of services in the regions, which are often provided out of delegated budgets, perhaps by quangos, as in the case of health provision. Primary care trusts and strategic health authorities are non-elected quangos, but they have an impact on the delivery of services in the regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ensuring that those delegated bodies and authorities work in concert is important and the Committee should consider those issues as well as the proposed devolution of very limited powers to regional assemblies. I would like the Committee to meet more often to scrutinise and examine such issues and bring them together. If the Government want joined-up

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making an important point. Is he suggesting that the Government should, for example, have brought the debate about strategic health authorities to the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, absolutely. Earlier on, before the hon. Gentleman arrived, I raised that very point. The issue of strategic health authorities should have been debated in this Committee, as should several other issues. Government Departments other than that which happens to include regions in its title should also bring issues of policy development to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I expected the hon. Gentleman to make a salient point, particularly bearing in mind that, like mine, his constituency has a coastal location. That is a bad pun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to Standing Order No. 117, which established the Committee, has the hon. Gentleman given any thought to how members of the Committee could establish the agenda in terms of who would appear before the Committee and on what basis? Does that Standing Order need to be reviewed, so that members of the Committee could have such a facility? Perhaps it is for the Chairman to allow its members to devise the agenda.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point. I do not have Standing Order No. 117 in front of me, but I am aware that in the setting up of the Committee it is both pertinent and appropriate that hon. Members who have not been appointed to it are able to attend and speak in it. Clearly, if there is a need for Committee members to consider the wider agenda outside Committee sittings—an informal structure could be used for setting agendas and applying pressure on the appropriate Department with a view to bringing policy issues to the Committee—that should happen. The Committee is not being used enough. If we are debating a motion on regional government for England, we are surely considering the whole issue of regional government, and the way in which it is to be brought about in the regions of England. That is not simply the question dealt with in the necessarily narrow parameters of the forthcoming White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that our debate is primarily about the forthcoming White Paper it is, despite what I have said, a vital one, dealing with an important part of the Government's unfinished business. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bath has made clear, the Liberal Democrats broadly support the principle of devolution to Scotland, Wales, London and Northern Ireland, and we have engaged constructively in that. Daily, we experience the failure of quangos and, despite what has been said, the unelected chambers that operate in the regions. The powers and budgets of the quangos really need to be brought within the orbit of democratically elected authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been little discussion in the debate so far of the powers that will be offered to regional assemblies. I hope that Ministers will take on board—assuming that the ink is not yet dry on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
White Paper—the idea that regional assemblies should be offered a menu of powers. Most people acknowledge the north-east and Yorkshire as foremost among the regions that have—from my reading of the situation—an apparently settled will on the matter, and where it may be that a robust case is being made out for drawing down the maximum possible powers from a menu of what is available. In other regions communities might make a case for a process of devolution, taking powers from the menu over time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only should there be a menu, which might result in variable implementation, but the Government should have in mind that this should be a process rather than an event. Their legislation should enable devolution to happen. Devolution should not require a repeated process of primary legislation; it should be possible to develop it through regulation, which would allow established regional assemblies, eventually, to make out a further case—the business case, the democratic case—to the Government for taking on further powers. I hope that as the Government pursue their proposals, they will consider, and take into account, the fact that we are entering uncharted territory. For that reason, the enabling legislation should be appropriate to a process, not an event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an enthusiastic devolutionist I want the project to achieve the maximum possible popular support. However, I am not certain that it will, for reasons mentioned already by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw and others. I am concerned about the increasingly low turnout for elections. There were disastrously low turnouts at the last regional election, which was for the European Parliament. My worry is that voters will stay home in their droves if we establish a regional government that is based on regions for which they feel no great enthusiasm. The authority of regional assemblies would be neutered as far as people in those so-called regions were concerned. If we are going to do what we say, it is important that we do it properly, effectively and well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important that we take on board the point made by the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff) and do not simply heap more politicians on the fire in dealing with the problem. I therefore support the Government when they make it clear that there should be a predominantly unitary system below each assembly. It will sometimes be difficult to set such systems up, but it is important that the Government insist that there are plans to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main theme, which was reflected in my questions to Ministers earlier, is that the Government's policy must reflect popular communities. If the Government establish regions simply on the basis of bureaucratic convenience, they shall create sanitised, synthetic regions, for which people have no feeling. They will not be supported by democratic legitimacy, and I fear that the whole project of devolution will be derailed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am enthusiastic to hand powers and democratic authority down to people in places with which they identify, but I genuinely fear that the Government are satisfying their control-freak tendencies. They will fit up England for regional assemblies, but not—where
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0579">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
there are difficulties—offer the regions the power to define themselves and to establish a settled will. They will not enable them to introduce proposals, which they may not initially like and which may not suit the tidy bureaucratic minds that are highly concentrated in the Whitehall community. Those proposals might, however, be far more successful in reflecting the popular will and delivering genuine services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My thesis is that the whole project will be derailed if the Government establish a control-freak version of devolution, which their obedient subjects must accept without scrutiny and which does not reflect identities. Matthew Arnold once said that it was the desire of a centralised state to render its dominion homogenous. If the centralised state wants to deliver a centralised-state version of devolution in uniform chunks of about 5 million people and to score the lines between the regions to satisfy its bureaucratic requirements, it will simply replace the bland uniformity of a centralised state with the bland uniformity of a centralised system of regional government for which people feel nothing. Ministers must assure us that they are not control freaks, obsessed or inflexible. The Minister said earlier that devolution would best be achieved by accepting the current administrative boundaries, and that paying too much attention to boundaries would derail the whole process. I understand the Minister's resistance to opening up the issue, but even on the most optimistic view of what is happening in southern Britain, there is no way that communities in the south will accept regions based on the boundaries proposed by the Government, especially in the south-east with the polo effect of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not for me to meddle in the affairs of the people of the south-east; they must resolve the issue for themselves, but although some may want to establish a constitutional convention and a campaign for the south-east, I cannot see how that will be achieved. It is clear that there is not yet a settled will in the Government-defined south-west for devolution either. However, I am pleased to be able to report that there are increasing signs of a settled will between the south-west constitutional convention and the Cornish constitutional convention, and a settled will may result from a modelling exercise funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and further negotiations. That should be welcomed. If Cornwall and the south-west were to form such a settled will and propose a solution to what would otherwise present a significant problem, I hope that the Minister would welcome that solution, as he indicated earlier that he might, and not simply try to impose a different solution and create another problem in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, I do not know why the English are so obsessed with size, but it seems to me that, in setting up regional assemblies, we need to be cognisant of the fact that people in other countries are not so obsessed with the dimensions of their regions or provinces. The Canadian province of Newfoundland, with which I have many connections through fishing, last week's Marconi centenary celebrations and other matters, has a population roughly the same size as that of
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
Cornwall, yet it has many powers. Other provinces have lower populations. For example, Prince Edward Island has a population of about 120,000. Where there are problems over economies of scale or the strategic delivery of services such as transport or health, they shrug their shoulders and say, "Easy. Where we need to achieve economies of scale, we overcome those problems by co-operating with our neighbours in other provinces." That is the step-up approach of regional devolution; giving the power to the people and, assuming that they are adults rather than juveniles—as they certainly are in Cornwall—they will co-operate in the way that is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept that there is no bickering in the south-west. An enormous effort is being made to resolve the issues. We want to devolve power to places with which people identify and we want the project to succeed. Therefore, if the south-west, Cornwall and other places want devolution, let us get on with it and stop bickering. The issue is not the same in relation to Cornwall and to Cumbria. Cornwall does not want to cut itself off; it wants to cut itself into the celebration of diversity. It is not about closing opportunities, but about opening them up to explore the future in a way that has been made possible—thank goodness—by the Government's support for its case for objective 1 status. It is proving a great success and will continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An argument is often made about a lack of clout. That makes us ask whether more clout would be given by distinctiveness or size. Cornwall would have far greater clout, in a wider world, if it were recognised as a distinct place rather than subsumed into a large sanitised region for which it had no feeling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to get even, but to get on. We do not want to cut ourselves off, but to cut ourselves in to the celebration of diversity. We do not want to divide the community, but to bring it together into the future of the process. If the Government do not offer a settlement but attempt to fix one in control-freak fashion, I warn that the process will be derailed. I am sure that they have learned lessons over the London Mayor and the First Minister of Wales, so they will no doubt reflect on them and take a flexible and non-obsessed approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship again, Mr. Hood. I believe that this is the first sitting of the Committee for some time, probably more than a year. That might suggest that the subject matter of our debate hardly attracts the attention of hon. Members. Many hon. Members have confirmed that the issue is hardly a burning one in their constituencies. The debate, although welcome, has hardly progressed the argument, and we look forward to the response of the Minister for Local Government. Perhaps he will shed light on some of the many questions that have been posed, but I suspect that he will not before the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seem lumbered with a policy that was thought up at the time of devolution for Scotland and Wales. To cover their back, perhaps someone
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
made a commitment in the manifesto that the English should have some devolution as well. The Government are slightly reluctant to give clear and unequivocal leadership on selling the idea of regional government. We have heard today about the problem of defining regional identity and the fact that there has been no discussion on the boundaries of the regions, which appear to be set in stone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for St. Ives made some points about Cornwall. He may have stopped short of advocating its independence, but it is clear what his local papers will cover tomorrow and the day after. There is no perfect solution for the delineation of regions. We heard of the Spanish experience as an example. There will be winners and losers, as the Minister more or less admitted in our question time. Until there is clear agreement on boundaries and definitions, this dog's dinner of a proposal will stagger from mini-crisis to mini-crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government insist that they will be pragmatic, but if they deem regional government to be in principle beneficial, a more efficacious way to deliver services and—they trot out the belief frequently—more accountable to the electorate, why do they not have the courage of their convictions and set a clear blueprint for regional government and all that follows from it, in terms of other tiers of government for England? Instead, the Government are allowing certain areas, through local plebiscites and referendums, to decide whether they want regional government. If the boundaries of the region have not been defined in the first place, what right have they to ask people in a delineated area whether they want regional government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some respects, that is putting the cart before the horse. Do the Government not share our concern, which was extremely well put by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire? My hon. Friend cogently made our argument against the concept of regional government, which is that a multi-layered model of local government would lead to confusion among the electorate. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw rightly said that we already have too many elections. Adding another will lead to confusion between the various tiers of local government about who is doing what, and who is responsible for this or that. Starting new structure on an ad hoc basis, some having the new tier and others not wanting it, will create more confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some regions may opt not to go for regional government, and the unlikely example of the south-east region was used, which makes no sense to us. However, if some do not accept regional government, who will then deliver the responsibilities that the Government want to devolve to regional government? Will the budgets that would otherwise have been given to regional governments be somehow devolved to existing tiers of local government such as county councils, metropolitan boroughs and the like; or will they be retained centrally so that the Government can deliver the services?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire spoke ably about referendums taking place at different times in different parts of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
country. If there is a move in the north-east and Yorkshire towards regional government, other regions will think that unless they, too, go for it, they will lose out. Unless the Government say clearly where that budget money is to go, the other regions will face substantial pressure to go for it; otherwise they may believe that they will lose out because the resources allocated to their regions will go either to regional government or to existing tiers of local government. Does the Minister not believe that regions that do not opt for regional government will be at a disadvantage? What does he think might happen in those circumstances?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial question, put by the hon. Member for Bath, was whether the powers that the Government want to give to regional government will be devolved from central Government or taken from the lower tiers of government. There seems little point in regional government if it is simply a glorified way of delivering services currently provided reasonably well by existing tiers of government, particularly by county councils and metropolitan boroughs. If the only additional responsibility is for economic development and regeneration, it could surely be added to the existing responsibilities of the various tiers of councils without going to the massive cost and trouble of reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby spoke of what took place in Humberside. It cost £53 million or thereabouts to reorganise Humberside county council. If that is replicated across the country, if all the shire counties go for regional government, reorganisations costs will come to £1.8 billion. What is the point, unless real advantages can be gained from the change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman. If he believes that to be so, why did the previous Conservative Administration abolish Humberside and Cleveland, and generally cause chaos in my part of the world?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was always a strong case for reorganising Humberside county council, because it did not work, and people in north Lincolnshire will tell anyone that they hated the concept. However, my point is that reorganisation will involve a massive cost, which must be justified by the benefits. Conservative Members have made it clear that the Government have not given a clear commitment or focused clearly on what the benefits will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me back to my first point, which is that the Government are not giving proper leadership. They are stuck with the policy and are in drift. We look forward to the White Paper, but it will not answer the key questions that have been posed today and on other occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hood.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. Nick Raynsford)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful and interesting debate, which has covered a range of subjects relating to our proposals for the introduction of elected regional assemblies in regions that opt for them. It is entirely appropriate that we have heard a range of different views, because the whole purpose of such a Committee is to act as a forum for hon. Members to discuss their experiences and views and for the Government to listen and learn. That is very much what we have sought to do, and I shall try to respond to the many questions that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby talked movingly about Whitby's isolation and its economic decline, which is associated with the decline of the fishing industry. He mentioned the need for more effective measures to revive and develop the economy, and we hope that a regional assembly with a strong focus on economic development in the Yorkshire and Humberside area would help to develop the economic proposals and related infrastructure investment that would reverse the downward trend. Whitby has several great advantages because it is an attractive location with strong literary associations and cultural qualities, and I have no doubt that it will, with the right support and the able involvement of my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby, enjoy a renaissance in the years ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support my hon. Friend's tribute to Jane Thomas and to the work of the Campaign for Yorkshire. I noted that he supported the Government's proposition that regions that choose to have an elected regional assembly should be able to have one. I had a most useful meeting in Yorkshire a couple of months ago with representatives from all parts of the region, including North Yorkshire, and I was impressed by the extent to which they wanted to work across political divisions. Not only politicians, but representatives of the business community and cultural organisations, trade unionists and others wanted to work together in the interests of the whole Yorkshire and Humberside region. That augurs well for the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath apologised that he was unable to stay for the rest of the debate and took issue with me over my use of the word "curmudgeonly", although he had some difficulty spelling it, which was a somewhat alarming revelation from a former teacher. I am pleased to say that I was able to supply him with a suggested spelling with which he seemed to agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman emphasised the importance of regional government and supported the proposition that it should be made available to those regions that expressed a wish for it, rather than being imposed on all regions. That theme has come up throughout the
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
debate, although it has been expressed in different terms. It is important to stress that if people believe, as the Government do, that regions should have the option to have an elected regional assembly, the necessary consequence of that is that there will be variations. Some regions will have elected assemblies, others will not. One cannot allow a regime based on consent and not accept the consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition may feel that that is not ideal, and the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) stressed that in his view the Government should lay down the blueprint and impose it everywhere, but I do not accept that proposition. The view expressed by the hon. Member for Bath more accurately reflects the wishes of the people of this country, that those who wish to have an elected regional assembly should have one and those who do not should be free not to. The Government are proceeding on the basis that people should not have the measure imposed on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to respond to some of the other points raised by the hon. Member for Bath. We strongly believe that there is a democratic case for making unaccountable bodies more accountable to the regions. We agree with him that there is a future role for Government offices. I note that he said that some Liberal Democrats believed that there would be no need for a Government office once an elected regional assembly had been established. The fact that the Liberal Democrats cannot agree on that puts us in familiar territory. I have no doubt that they will debate the matter at great length, but our view is that Government offices will continue to have a role, though a reduced and changed one, which is what happened in London. There is still a Government office there, but its role has changed since the creation of the Greater London Authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On methods of election, the hon. Member for Bath referred to the precedents of the proportional systems used in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London. I will say no more about that. We will examine those precedents when considering what proposals we will put in the White Paper. Those proposals will be revealed when we publish the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of size—to stress the key theme—the hon. Member for Bath thought that the Liberal Democrat White Paper, when published, would opt for larger assemblies than the Government's proposals. I have never known a Liberal Democrat who did not want more opportunities for talking shops where people can gather and talk incessantly. However, as I suggested earlier, our view is that the assemblies should be fit for the purpose and should be streamlined bodies capable of delivering value for money, rather than talking shops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire made it clear that he did not support the creation of elected regional assemblies. I accept that Worcestershire may have no interest in the idea of an elected regional assembly. I hope that he will take comfort from the fact that we have no intention of imposing an elected regional assembly on those regions that do not express a wish to have one. The policy is permissive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
However, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that there are strong feelings in some regions, particularly in the north, where people want a greater degree of devolution and the opportunity to control matters relevant to their region. It would be wrong to deny them that opportunity on the grounds that people in other parts of the country did not feel the same pressing need for such a programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman expressed concerns about some of the existing regional bodies, which he suggested should be abolished or made accountable to counties or unitary authorities, and he accused the Government of seeking to abolish counties, claiming that we were doing so by progressively stripping them of their planning powers and threatening them in all sorts of ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a degree of inconsistency in the hon. Gentleman's arguments. If he argues, as he did, that the regional assemblies risk creating another tier of government, it is difficult for him to argue against the proposals in our planning Green Paper that there are too many tiers of planning powers. There are regional, county and district tiers, and possibly a local tier as well. He can take one option or the other. Either he opts for streamlining and cutting out tiers and accepts the argument that there are too many tiers in planning, or he can say that he wants all those tiers, in which case his argument against regional assemblies is not very convincing. I simply ask him to be consistent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that regional assemblies would be established only where there were predominantly unitary authorities. The counties in the west midlands have mostly two-tier authorities, so how could there be a regional assembly there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that one of the issues is whether there should be some reorganisation before or following the creation of a regional assembly, in order to meet the condition that such assemblies should be in a predominantly unitary framework. That is a more acute issue in the west midlands, the south-west and other regions than in the Yorkshire and Humber region, where 89 per cent. of the population live in unitary areas. That key issue will be addressed. We entirely accept the importance of there being no proliferation of tiers of government. It is right that the process should be logical and rational but, equally, we do not want to unleash a destructive process of local government reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most honest way of assessing what happened in the Banham review of the early 1990s was that many local authorities spent disproportionate time, energy and effort arguing about boundaries, functions and division of responsibility, compared to what they put into high-quality service delivery, which we believe should be the priority. A balance must be achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am to respond to the points that the hon. Gentleman made, I have no time to take an intervention. I must respond to the points made by the hon. Member for St. Ives, who raised several issues
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
about the powers of regional assemblies, which we will spell out in the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for St. Ives suggested that regions be offered a menu of powers and choose those that suited them. That may sound attractive, but it has an obvious down side. A decision taken at one time about powers available to a region may not conform to the view of members of that regional assembly a few years later. If they were bound by an earlier decision, they could resent the fact that they had fewer powers than another region. To allow them to change the powers would be a recipe for confusion, and for chopping and changing, so the proposition is not as easy as he might suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want a proliferation of politicians, which is why we have set the predominantly unitary objective. I agreed with the hon. Gentleman's observation about Matthew Arnold and the desire of centralised states to render their territory homogenous. The Government have been keen to do exactly the opposite, and devolve power to the regions and nations to create a more diverse but stronger union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire raised several issues to which I will try to respond. If I have a moment, I will give way to him. I was slightly misled by the traditional clock, which implied that my time was virtually up. I see that it is two minutes ahead of the electronic ones, so there may be a chance to let him intervene.

I agree that there is no perfect solution for the delineation of boundaries, but a wholesale review of boundaries would almost inevitably delay the process. We do not intend to be rigid. We will not impose some blueprint uniformly without any consideration, but it is right to start from the building blocks of the existing Government office regions. That allows orderly and sensible progression and debate. We intend to be sensitive. The hon. Member for St. Ives rightly raised concerns about Cornwall, of which we are conscious. We want to take full account of them and the views of the constitutional convention.

The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire asked whether regions that did not opt for an elected regional assembly would be disadvantaged. I thought that I had answered that in my responses to questions, when I said that the White Paper would spell out the precise arrangements that we proposed for regions that did not opt for such assemblies, to ensure that they did not lose out as a result. There must be mechanisms for channelling funds for the needs of regions that do not have regional assemblies. There will be assemblies in some areas because of the permissive approach that we are adopting.

We made it clear that our objective was to devolve powers from above, rather than for them to be taken from below. We want local authorities to continue to focus on the key task of local service delivery, and have no intention of taking the relevant powers away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, does the Minister agree with Lord Falconer, who said that if regional government were introduced, a tier of government

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. We have said clearly that we want to introduce our framework within a pattern of predominantly unitary local government. As I said, that will require us to consider how reorganisation would apply in areas that wanted a regional assembly. That is not the same as wholesale reorganisation or the
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
abolition of whole tiers of government, and there is no truth in the claim that we are keen to abolish the counties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
