	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Nick Raynsford)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 39).</p></blockquote>
The Montserrat special grant scheme is my Department's contribution to the Government's effort to help Montserratians re-settle in this country. Report No. 39, which is before the Committee, proposes to pay grants totalling £24,000 to six local housing authorities for accommodation that they have provided for Montserratian households. The purpose of the grant was to ensure that Montserratian evacuees, under the Government's assisted passages scheme, who needed social housing, were quickly rehoused as part of the special reception arrangements established by the Home Office at Heathrow and Gatwick airports. At the same time, we anticipated that this would also relieve the pressure on those local authorities with small Montserratian communities, usually in the Greater London area, who had taken responsibility for rehousing the majority of such evacuees before the introduction of the grant. The grant scheme has ensured that the reception arrangements have worked successfully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Report No. 39 effectively covers the accommodation provided by local authorities for evacuees during the two-month period at the end of the last financial year—February and March 1998. The grant scheme that we originally announced in October 1997 closed at the end of January 1998. A special grant report—No. 32—was approved by the House in March last year. We decided, however, that grants should continue to be paid to authorities until the end of the last financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hence, this report covers the remaining two months of that financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms of the grant remain unchanged. A flat rate grant of £1,500 is paid to an authority for each unit of accommodation provided for a Montserratian evacuee who has arrived in the UK under the assisted passages scheme and has been placed with an authority by Heathrow Travelcare, the reception agents of the Home Office. Accommodation may be provided under either the homelessness legislation—temporary accommodation for a two-year period—or, alternatively, the authority's allocation scheme. In practice, most of the Montserratians have been rehoused by the authorites as homeless applicants. We have advised authorities that evacuees from
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Montserrat should be treated as having a priority need for accommodation, so they are entitled to be rehoused for two years under the homelessness legislation because they are homeless as a result of the volcanic disaster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Report No. 39 reflects the closing period of what has been a successful, albeit modest, grant scheme. The scheme has achieved the original objective of ensuring that all Montserratian evacuees seeking assistance from Heathrow Travelcare in finding social housing have had ready access to such housing. I commend the report to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.33 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Waterson
	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are delighted to be meeting under your supervision today, Mrs Michie. The Minister may relax since, on any view, the numbers involved—16 people and £24,000—are modest, and subject to satisfactory clarification of one or two points, I shall not be urging the Committee to oppose the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all have great sympathy with the plight of the evacuees and with the population of Montserrat generally. The Committee is not the right forum for a discussion of how the situation has been handled. The Select Committee on Foreign Affairs had its own comments to make about that, but I shall move on because the errors and omissions are those of another Department, not that which the Minister represents today. I see that the report makes no provision for golden elephants, but simply enables housing costs to be refunded. Nevertheless, I have some questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, what is the position of those who were rehoused subsequent to the end of that financial year, and of those who may yet be evacuated from Montserrat? We do not know the course that the tragedy will take. If the volcanic situation became much worse—God forbid—many more people would need to be evacuated and rehoused. Nevertheless, I am sure that the nation would not be found wanting if that were to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, what is the position of those who have chosen, or who may choose in future, to relocate here from Montserrat? Will the scheme continue beyond the scope of the report? I appreciate that it has always been treated as an interdepartmental matter since the volcanic eruption, but do the Government have a policy for the dispersal of evacuees or for their concentration?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, how does the regime tie in with the regime proposed in the Immigration and Asylum Bill, which was given its Second Reading on Monday? How does it tie in with the concept of reception zones, and the new and separate regime for welfare payments? I assume that that would be a wholly different matter, because it will affect asylum seekers and refugees in the usual way. Although that is primarily a Home Office responsibility, the Minister may want to answer. We hear a great deal about joined-up government, and this seems to be one of those rare examples where the Government are indeed joined up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Finally, the figure of £1,500 is a suspiciously round figure. I should be interested to know how that figure was arrived at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I report the main question, which was about the total numbers involved prior to and subsequent to the duration of the special grant. However, subject to satisfactory answers to those questions, I have no desire to divide the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.37 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) for his broad support for the proposals and for the specific questions that he asked, which I shall try to answer in full.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He asked first what would be the position of those who had been rehoused since the end of the financial year and of those who may in future choose to come here from Montserrat. The scheme was put in place to cope with a particularly serious pressure at a time then there was a relatively large-scale influx of refugees from Montserrat because of the volcanic activity that took place there about two years ago. Happily, the situation has stabilised. The lastest scientific advice is that there is no imminent prospect of further eruptions, so there is no current prospect of a further wave of refugees from Montserrat. Therefore, we do not anticipate the need for a continuation of the scheme, but if it became necessary we would be prepared to reactivate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then asked whether we had a policy of dispersal. No; the scheme was based on the principle that it was wrong for the burden of accommodating refugees from Montserrat to fall exclusively on the relatively small number of authorities—mainly located in Greater London with an existing Montserratian community—that bore the brunt of the initial wave of refugees immediately after the eruption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
The purpose of the scheme—this is also a way of answering the hon. Gentleman's fourth question about how the figure of £1,500 was chosen—was to encourage other local authorities to provide accommodation, and thereby to relieve some of the pressures on the small number of authorities that were a natural magnet for people coming from Montserrat. The scheme was entirely voluntary. We felt that an incentive would encourage authorities to make a generous and positive response. As the hon. Gentleman rightly surmised, the figure of £1,500 was an arbitrary choice, which we thought would give the right degree of incentive. I am pleased to say that it was agreed after discussion with the Local Government Association and the Chartered Institute of Housing and that it has proved successful; it has worked. The local authorities that have proposed schemes are satisfied with the arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Gentleman asked how the scheme will tie in with the Immigration and Asylum Bill. I think that he anticipated my response. This is an entirely different procedure intended to deal with a specific circumstance. Those involved are not seeking asylum; they have had to flee the island of Montserrat because of the appalling circumstances of the volcanic eruption there. They were guaranteed that, on arrival in the United Kingdom, they would be entitled to enter the country, to accommodation and to be able to work. Their circumstances are quite different from those of people seeking asylum. I hope that my remarks satisfy the hon. Gentleman and that he agrees that the Committee should approve the report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
