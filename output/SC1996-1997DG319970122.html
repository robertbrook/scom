	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Liddell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Education (Assisted Places) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 1808).</p></blockquote>
I first apologise to the Committee for the fact that my voice is not as loud as usual. The downside is that I have a sore throat—the upside is that it will make my speech considerably shorter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure before us seeks to extend the assisted places scheme to include children under the age of 11, among other things. This will see the further expansion of a scheme which is already to be doubled in size over three years, and that of course will be a futher burden on the British taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the fact that only one Scottish Conservative Member is present, it might, as a matter of courtesy, be as well to point out that in Scotland the education system is significantly different from that in England and Wales. In Scotland, the overwhelming support for state comprehensive education means that 96 per cent. of all children in Scottish schools are in the state sector. Even those who can afford to send their children to private schools choose to send them to state sector schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The very fact that the assisted places scheme exists is a straightforward acknowledgement by the Government that they view the state sector as second best. The arguments that they use in support of the scheme largely relate to the fact that it gives children "from poorer families" an opportunity to attend private schools. Those of us who have had the benefit of a good Scottish state education—and I include the Minister among that number—know that there are few countries in the world that can provide an education of the quality of the Scottish state sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extension of the assisted places scheme to those in primary education has not been broadly welcomed in Scotland. That should be no surprise. How can it be, when an extra £9 million has been given to the expansion of a scheme that already benefits private schools to the tune of £11 million—by contrast with the drastic cuts in local authority education budgets of £60 million last year—4.7 per cent.—and this year, a further £21 million?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the statement of the right hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown)—the shadow Chancellor—on Monday this week that there will be no extra money for local government and that any further spending will have to be taken from another budget, will the hon. Lady tell the Committee, in the light of what she has just said, which budget she will be raiding for further expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, becuase he gives me the opportunity to point out that that is exactly the subject that we are discussing this afternoon—moving resources into the state sector. The assisted places scheme will be phased out by an incoming Labour Government, as will some of the other dogmatic steps that have been taken by the Minister at the behest of the Secretary of State for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is making a categoric statement that her party would phase out, over time, the assisted places scheme and put that money into education. Those who follow our proceedings should know that that will come to £2 million. What will £2 million buy the entire state education system in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the Minister is going through the subject with a number of questions, at the end of my remarks I should like to consider the impact of the assisted places scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said £2 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister will allow me to continue, I should like to look at the impact of the assisted places scheme on the overall education of children in Scotland. The money that we will use from the assisted places scheme will be used to reduce class sizes in the first three years of primary school. That is a start. As resources permit, and as we operate a much more efficient and less wasteful system than the Government's, we then hope to use our resources even more fully to benefit those in state education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the main point, I should like to ask the Minister a number of questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Jackson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wantage)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of interest, can the hon. Lady tell us how much in total is spent on schools in Scotland, and what proportion of that total £2 million represents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for joining us in the Committee this afternoon to learn about Scottish education, but I am here to talk about the assisted places scheme, which is the subject of the order before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should welcome some answers from the Minister. Over the past couple of years, I have asked him several questions about the assisted places scheme, and I have received no answers. When he responds to my remarks, will he tell the Committee how much of the additional £9 million that is being made available to extend the scheme will de directed towards children
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
under 11? I believe I am correct in stating that the scheme has been extended since September 1996. Will the Minister tell the Committee how many under-lls have so far entered the assisted places scheme and how many of them were already in the private sector?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore—this relates to the point made by the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Jackson)—there is great concern in Scotland about the fact that the expansion of the scheme will benefit a disproportionately tiny minority of Scottish pupils—only 0.4 per cent. of the 4 per cent. of children in the private sector. What about the 96 per cent. of children who are in the state sector? I am sure that they would benefit from the sums that the Minister has in the past claimed could add up to £20 million, if that amount were allocated to the state sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1995, average expenditure per pupil on the assisted places scheme was £3,500. That compares with only £2,700 per pupil in state schools. Those are the Government's own figures from Her Majesty's inspectorate's "Scottish School Costs 1995-97". In Scottish primary schools, average expenditure per pupil in 1995 was £1,700. What is the estimated figure for pupils in the assisted places scheme? Will it be significantly higher, as it is for secondary schools?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We debated this matter about 14 months ago in relation to a similar statutory instrument. At that time, the Minister claimed that the scheme does not provide a subsidy to private sector schools. He has failed to explain why a number of schools each benefit from more than £500,000 a year. I know that that figure is attractive to the Minister—after all, he managed to find £500,000 for one tiny school in Dunblane. But if private schools are to benefit to the tune of £500,000 from taxpayer's money, why cannot such sums be taken from the scheme and used directly in the state sector? A school in Edinburgh received £975,000 in the last academic year, when only 11 per cent. of its pupils were on the assisted places scheme. That seems to be a classic case of misdirection of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's usual response is that the scheme gives children more equal opportunities, regardless of their parents' income, and that parents recognise that the scheme offers their children the chance of better academic results, but the figures do not bear that out. If one analyses the figures, particularly those that were made available in the Scottish Office press releases, it is obvious that about 52 per cent. of those currently benefiting from the assisted places scheme were already in the private sector. If that is not a classic opportunity for subsidising private schools that are, in some cases, failing, I do not know what is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a recognition in the educational community in Scotland that the assisted places scheme is keeping open schools that would otherwise have long since closed. I have met representatives of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools and individual schools in the independent sector, a number of which are worried about schools that do not provide the quality of education which they are providing and are able to continue as a result of the subsidies which are available through the assisted places scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much would it cost to incorporate in the public sector the relevant pupils who are currently in independent schools in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman's intervention. In the spirit of the new year, and the cooperation and friendship that we Scots experience at this time, I suggest that the Minister should brief those who join him in Committee a little better. According to the Accounts Commission, there are currently 300,000 additional places in Scottish schools; indeed, it is a matter of great debate in Scotland that a significant number of schools have excess places. That is causing difficulties not only for local authorities but for the Minister. That debate will continue in the coming months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady did my hon. Friend the Member for Wantage the disservice of not answering his question. Perhaps she is answering questions from Scottish Members only—will she answer me? Is she suggesting that pupils with assisted places would be absorbed into the state sector at no cost—yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was making to the hon. Member for Wantage is straightforward: there are 300,000 additional places in Scottish schools. There is a perfect logic in ensuring that those pupils would not choose to go to state schools—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister should allow me to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, certainly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ensure that the debate focuses on the education needs of Scottish children, not on pennies of income tax, which the Minister is obsessed with. Quite apart from the fact that there is spare capacity in plenty of Scottish schools, some of them are failing their pupils—they are forced into it—because there are not enough pupils to allow them to provide a broad and balanced curriculum. If certain schools had more pupils that curriculum could be achieved, to the benefit of all pupils. Does the hon. Member for Wantage care about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the past 24 hours I have learnt that the Minister—through the Secretary of State for Scotland, the right hon. Member for Stirling—is advising three schools which want to ballot on opting out so as to avert closure that they cannot do so. It has been recognised that some schools are not educationally viable because their rolls have fallen.

I shall return to the—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to press the point but, before the hon. Lady moves on—her hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) tried to help her out of the little hole she dug for herself—will she, for the sake of clarity, say whether the 3,500 pupils on the assisted places scheme would be absorbed into the state sector at no extra cost to education authorities, yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to respond to the Minister. On such occasions I am always reminded of how much I enjoy the simple things in life. I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill—some of the simple things in life are sitting opposite us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to labour the point, but I say again to the Minister that there are 300,000 additional places in Scottish schools. He, as the Minister responsible for education, has failed to address that overcapacity. Scottish Office Ministers are, in the words of Lanarkshire, incapable of running a menodge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way one more time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not for a minute suggesting that there are not 300,000 surplus places. The Accounts Commission has given that figure and I have used it often, but the hon. Lady should understand that that is not the issue. The issue is the absorption of those pupils who are currently in the assisted places scheme into the state sector. Those issues are different. Will she say quickly, so that we can move on, whether those 3,500 pupils can be absorbed at no extra cost—yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am firmly of the opinion that with efficiency on the part of the Government it would have been more than possible to reduce Scottish schools' excess capacity. Those resources could have been used to ensure that all our children have the best for their education. After 18 years, the bankruptcy of the Conservative Government is striking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The order is part of the process of assisting private and independent schools to remain open. Shortly before we debated these matters in November 1995, the Secretary of State for Scotland announced, in a Scottish Office press release dated 13 October 1995, that the scheme was to be expanded. He also stated that he realised that the scope of a number of schools participating in the scheme to take more pupils on a subsidised basis was limited, and that he would consult the Scottish Council of Independent Schools about how those pupils could be assisted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is regrettable that Opposition Members have found it very difficult to get any information about the outcome of that consultation. The Committee would benefit if the Minister were to describe that outcome, which is germane to our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have drawn to the Minister's attention several times the difference between the operation of the assisted places scheme in Scotland and in England. There is much anxiety, not least in the independent schools sector, about the lack of facilities for independent monitoring and auditing of the scheme's operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the famous case involving the Freeman family in England. That wealthy family took advantage of the assisted places scheme. The Freemans were able to protect the £30,000 put aside
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
for the children's education because a good accountant enabled them to adjust their disposable income so as to be below the assisted places scheme's threshold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not tackled that major problem. Scottish independent schools are expected to act as judge and jury in regard to applications from parents keen to ensure that they benefit from the assisted places scheme. That is not an appropriate way to look after taxpayer's money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to Government figures, in 1995 a quarter of families benefitting from the assisted places scheme had incomes of £17,000 or more. We in Scotland are aware of the problems that our children experience in the education sector. The fabric of our schools is just one example: in some cases it is appalling. Those of us with children in the state sector know well the difficulties experienced by teachers and pupils as a result of problems with the buildings in which they work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education cuts mean that children in my constituency have to pay £80 each for music tuition. Many families are extremely poor, yet they must use money that they cannot afford to ensure that their children get a musical education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where is the fairness in that? The order is ideologically driven, yet there are children in state sector schools who are significantly disadvantaged. One thing that unites Scots is a desire for fairness, yet that is what the order lacks. It would impose a burden on the taxpayer, at a time when 96 per cent. of the children in Scottish schools are in the state sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is a classic example of how the Government favour the few at the expense of the many. It would be regrettable if the Committee were to approve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As an English member of the Committee I am entitled to resent the implication that I am an intruder. A substantial amount of English taxpayer's money is transferred to Scotland.

We would replace the assisted places scheme with locally determined partnerships between the education authorities and independent schools, and we would encourage special bursaries to be set up to help those with special needs or those with special talents such as music, sport, drama or mathematics. There should be greater co-operation over the purchasing of services and equipment from each other and in using each other's facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell the Minister that it is difficult to conceal my anger at today's announcement when my constituents face dire education cuts to the tune of £3.5 million. Strathclyde region significantly invested in education, but we have inherited a funding mismatch.

	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
The explanatory note talks about increasing grant for clothing and travel costs under the assisted places scheme. To meet the £3.5 million cut in Argyll and Bute, however, travel, subsistence and clothing grants will have to be reduced by 20 per cent. and walking distances for secondary and primary pupils will have to be increased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Michie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that matter because between 16 and 22 rural schools in my constituency face closure.

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

They do not even want to learn anything from our debate. Our constituents face school closures, and I wish that they could be here to observe our proceedings—as I am sure that the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Michie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not because I need to proceed. My constituency faces another cut because the Government propose to cut all further education bursaries.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should do her homework before she comes to the Committee and makes ludicrous allegations.

Finally and most despicably, the money that goes to the assisted places scheme would go a long way to preventing proposed cuts in music education. Instrumental music instruction is to be withdrawn from our schools, which means that superb

internationally known bands, such as those from Campeltown grammer, Dunoon grammer and Rothesay academy, will no longer exist. Children will thus lose the benefit of a musical education. Last year's Scottish girl trumpeter of the year came from Campletown, but funding will now be pulled from under children's feet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot believe that the Minister will allow that to happen. This weekend, I shall make sure that all my constituents are told what is happening with the assisted places scheme, and they will certainly know who is responsible for all the cuts come the general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said earlier that the assisted places scheme is supposed to help poorer families. Before we continue with the debate, how many families who have children on assisted places are self-employed? In particular, how many are farmers? I have heard of a farmer whose children are on assisted places but who has a huge number of acres; he is therefore unlikely to be on the sort of low income that would enable his children truthfully to be in receipt of this benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we had the corresponding debate this time last year, the hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) made similar allegations about fraud. I asked her then, 13 months ago, to write to me with examples and I assured her that they would be investigated. There have been no investigations, because I am still waiting for a letter from the hon. Lady. I give the hon. Member for Maryhill the same pledge: if she writes to me with examples of such abuse, I will have them investigated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: So you do not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I have heard about it from a person who knows the family. The Minister must be aware that it is perfectly easy for people to get away with such abuse, because the schools do not have the resources to check whether a family are on the proper income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way on this point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just let me finish. Schools do not have the resources to check. Is the Minister telling us that he believes that every family that has ever succeeded in winning an assisted place has done so honestly? If he believes that, he must believe that the moon is made of green cheese.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way. She said that schools do not have sufficient resources. I give her the same pledge that I gave to the hon. Member for Monklands, East last year. If she has any examples of abuse or fraud in the system, it will not
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
be the school that investigates them; I will devote the full resources of my Department to that investigation. The hon. Member for Monklands, East could not do that; a year later, I am still waiting for a letter from her containing examples. Does the hon. Member for Maryhill have any examples of abuse or fraud of the scheme which she would like my Department to investigate—yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister really cared about the public purse, he would ensure at least that spot investigations were carried out to see whether individual families who claimed to be self-employed and within the income limits really were. A little investigation from his Department would do no harm, and it would protect the public purse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the Minister has not had discussions with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools. A number of independent school bursars have already had discussions with me about the fact that they recognise that they have neither the powers nor the right to inquire into the family circumstances of those who apply for the assisted places scheme. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill will agree that that is a sign of extreme laxity on the Minister's part, which is of great concern to the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valuable point, which leaves the Minister with no ground to stand on. It is up to him to investigate, because the schools cannot do it. It is his responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat that if the Minister were properly responsible for the public purse, he would do a spot check to satisfy himself as to whether such abuse was going on. If he believes that it is not going on, he is the only person in the whole of Scotland to hold that belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall move on to the reasons why families might choose to send their children to the schools that benefit from this handout. They obviously want their children to get on, but they ignore the fact that 96 per cent. of children in Scotland attend state schools. They are not handicapped from getting on. Indeed, over the years the House has, to its benefit, been filled with hon. Members who have been educated in the Scottish state sector. The Minister nods in agreement. The Scottish state sector has done pretty well by its children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

With regard to the fraudulent misuse of public funds, I have brought such a case to the attention of all the Ministers at the Scottish Office on several

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I expect the letter was sent to the Minister's colleague, but the Minister was in the House when I raised the matter with the Secretary of State. The Scottish Office has done nothing about a serious allegation of the fraudulent payment of £600,000. [

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not bother to investigate a sum of that size, it explains why they do not investigate the relatively paltry sums involved in families claiming this benefit. They expect social advantage in terms of being in with the right people. That is all very well for the families involved, but times are hard and people are suffering abominable cuts in essential services. Why should this handout be paid to people who do not need it because they could be educated perfectly well in the state sector? As other hon. Members have said, state schools are having to close and other valuable services are being cut.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that, recently, Inverclyde and Renfrew district councils have had to make savage cuts in contributions to voluntary organisations from the education budget. Now, many young people, who normally take part in cultural activities in school, will no longer be able to afford to do so. Today, the Minister has given a handout that he should have given to ordinary working-class kids who were making use of those opportunities and getting access to schools through the education budget, albeit after school, but that is a vital time for some people in our community who suffer incredibly low rates of wages and deprivation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fife</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. All Opposition Members who represent Scottish constituencies have constituents whose families cannot afford to provide the sort of activities that my hon. Friend mentioned, which were provided in schools but which have been withdrawn. Things can only get worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This scheme keeps open schools that would otherwise have to close, so it is a benefit aimed at maintaining that privilege in society. State schools have had to close because pupil numbers have fallen. Pupil numbers have fallen, not because there has been some kind of sweep of people into the private sector, but because the number of children has fallen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is Labour party policy to phase out this system. I think it is generous of the Labour Party to decide to phase it out rather than stop it at once. The reason for phasing it out is to avoid disrupting children's
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
education—we are a kind-hearted lot. This bunch opposite do not care tuppence about children's education being disrupted when state schools close, which has happened twice in my constituency. Our state secondary school had to close and children were shifted en masse to a school in a different area with different teachers, different textbooks and classes at different stages in particular subjects. The Government do not care tuppence about the fact that those children's educational development is being hampered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that Conservative Members have been keen to intervene and attempt to display wit, but none of them are ready to speak on the subject. They do not care tuppence.

	<div class='member'>Ms Squire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make it absolutely clear that I oppose the regulations. I am deeply opposed to any education system that is built on patronage, privilege and wealth. It is wrong to restrict educational opportunity to the few. One of my earliest lessons in politics—I am being totally honest—came from a farther who was denied educational opportunity, despite winning a scholarship, because of his family's poverty. Whatever Conservative Members say, private education is available only to the few and not to the many. The assisted places scheme is an example of more public money being used to maintain the patronage and privilege represented by the private sector. It does nothing for equal opportunity—in fact, it denies opportunities and is neither equitable nor accessible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister seems to be consulting a document to discover which school I attended, I shall tell him that, as I was brought up in the English educational system I went to a grammar school on the basis of the 11-plus. I came to oppose that system at the age of 10 when I saw how it divided people into successes and failures and created a two-tier system. The school that I attended subsequently became private. It is no accident that the school, despite knowing that I am a Member of Parliament, has never invited me back to address it because people there know full well that I would say what I am saying this afternoon.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Any form of private education does nothing to provide choice, especially choice for families who are struggling to raise children. I completely oppose a further extension of the assisted places scheme to lower age groups and an increase in the amount of relevant income taken into account to provide clothing grants for families. I support the point made by the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) that the money would be better spent on nursery education and on facilities for children with special needs which, in Fife, Argyll and throughout Scotland, are under severe threat because of local government cuts imposed by the Government. Public money should be put to better use by improving educational opportunity for all. It would be nice to think that, for once, Conservative Members would consider the interests and needs of the many rather than those of the few.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have no hesitation in supporting the regulations. I regret the fact that my right to attend the Committee has been placed in doubt by Opposition Members. Some of them served with me on the Committee that considered a Scottish education measure in 1988, and I believe that I attended each of that Committee's sittings—it sat morning, noon and night on Tuesdays and Thursdays for about three months. I am sure that the hon.

Perhaps that Committee found out where I went to school, as it may have done with the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Ms Squire). It may have decided that Littlehampton secondary modern school for boys—which I attended for six years, from the age of 11 to the age of 18, because I failed my 11—plusqualified me to offer views on the proposed assisted
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
places scheme. It might also have decided that somewhere in the United Kingdom there were others like me who would have had better educational opportunities if the regulations had been in place in 1962. I must add that the secondary modern school that I attended provided me with five O-levels, three Alevels—I gained grades A, B and C—and a place at the university of York.

We should be careful when we say that the old 11-plus system necessarily condemned children to a bad education. Although I am inadequate in many other respects, I like to think that the educational achievement that I obtained through my secondary modern school is a tribute to the system that was in place. I accept that there is a view that children who go to secondary modern schools should have the same opportunities as those who go to grammar schools. The arrangements for the assisted places scheme provide such educational opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the comments of the deputy Opposition spokesman for education, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris). Last Friday she reassured the people of Wirral, South that in the event of a Labour Member representing that constituency all the grammar schools, selection systems and secondary modern schools would be safe and that none of the special privileges that have become available in the past 18 years as a result of the Government's educational programme would be challenged by the Labour party. The deputy Opposition spokesman for education gave those commitments to the people of Wirral, South last Friday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I support the regulations because they offer choice and opportunity. The hon. Member for Maryhill just reminded me that, in Scotland, there is virtually unanimous, all-in, comprehensive state provision. We hear from the leader of the Labour party that, as far as middle England is concerned, he wants to champion the rights of the people—the parents—to have difference. He claims that where differences of emphasis already exist, they will be safe in his hands

If Labour Members were able to have their way and their leader were to give them a totally free hand, they would have no private schools, no assisted places, no grammar schools and no secondary modern schools—but we are told a totally different story in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have this exposition of English education, but I am not sure what relevance it has to the debate.

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lord.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astounded that, at this point in the Government's life, they can provide £9 million for assisted places. That is a rough estimate of the cost. It is astounding, given that local government, which runs education in Scotland, is suffering the most horrendous attack through cuts to its services. Local government has difficulties in trying to reach the educational targets set by the Government. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes attacked my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West for being new Labour. The Labour party is renewing itself because of the difficulties that it will face in education and educational opportunities in the new millennium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is planned to spend £9 million on a very privileged and strict regime for people who are normally wealthy. People who favour private schools and want a private education should pay for it. There is no problem. They can have private schools. However, the Government are throwing all the taxpayer's money at a few privileged people. My village has suffered: two schools in my village stayed closed. I remember the horrors and the traumas experienced by many people. One of
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
the arguments advanced by the education authorities was that they were getting such a savage battering by the Government, who had cut everything, that they were faced with closing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Think how many teachers £9 million could employ. Local authorities will have to consider how many teachers they will be forced to make redundant—that is already happening. Instead of going to assistaed places, the £9 million could be spent on keeping schoolteachers doing the job that they have been trained and educated for. That would ensure that all young people in Scotland, not only the few privileged ones in private schools, could partake in the educational opportunities that we, as taxpayers, want to provide them with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am astounded that the Minister can come to us at this time of year. It is just an election gimmick by the Conservatives, as usual, to try to get some votes from their wealthy friends, but it is too late in the day. That £9 million should be used to help all children in education in Scotland and not limited to the few.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes admitted to not being able to overcome the 11-plus examination. I too suffered that experience but I also acquired qualifications that enabled me to teach in Edinburgh for 14 years. I am totally opposed to inequality in education. The Scottish and English education systems are very different from each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was at a secondary modern on the other side of the Humber from the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes and so I have experience, albeit sparse, of an English school. Scottish state schools range widely in size but, given resources and facilities, provide children with the opportunity to reach the top of many professions. One has only to think of Professor Murdo Macleod who, before he came to the mainland at the age of five, could not speak English and yet became professor of natural philosophy at Glasgow university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such proposals, put forward on the basis of Conservative ideology, damage the system. I am opposed to the measure, because a school in that part of my constituency which, come April or May, will be represented by my hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know about the date of the election: it is not my province. However, that school, which has many fine teachers, suffers the terrible threat of closure. That would not have happened had we kept Strathclyde regional council. The problems that the young constituents of the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute face because they are deprived of so many opportunities in the wonderful schools in Carradale, Campbeltown and Tarbert would not have occurred if Strathclyde regional council's education department still existed. I do not see any shame in defending such so-called bullies against what the motley lot on the Government Benches offer. The Minister and his colleagues abhor honest criticism. For getting up and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
asking what we hope are thoughtful, critical questions about how the Government administer education, we get sneers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How many children in Inverclyde benefit from the assisted places scheme and how many benefit from the state system, which includes fine schools such as Notre Dame high school, St Stephen's high school and, in the non-denominational sector, Greenock academy and Greenock high school? A first-class system of education provides youngsters with equality of opportunity—if not of outcome. My family and I were denied equality of opportunity when we were young and had experience of the so-called English education system. Having experienced both, as a pupil and a teacher, I think that the Scottish system is much better and is being damaged by the Government; but thank God we are now talking about fewer than 100 days before we can put things right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting and, in some ways, intriguing debate, which has been enhanced by the contributions of hon. Members who did not have the experience of a Scottish education. In particular, I thank the hon. Members for Monklands, East and for Greenock and Port Glasgow and my hon. Friends for contributing to this United Kingdom debate. What we heard from the Labour party was nothing short of raw prejudice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I gave way to him several times.

The Minister paid tribute to his hon. Friends for assisting him in the debate. Does he support the opinion of his hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes that Scottish state education should benefit from the 11-plus and the structure of grammar and secondary modern schools? Many people in Scotland will be interested to hear his reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not just the hon. Lady's throat that is hurting—I do not think that my hon. Friend said any such thing. The hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A great deal of abuse has been aimed by Opposition Members at hon Members such as myself, who have attempted to intervene in the debate. We asked a number of questions which were not answered, and that caused some derision. Will my hon. Friend the Minister take up and answer those questions? I asked about the cost of transferring pupils from the assisted places scheme to schools in Scotland, and about what proportion of total expenditure in Scotland would be represented by the £2.5 million that would be saved by abolishing the assisted places scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my hon. Friend's contribution. He had many years of distinguished service in education, and I shall address those issues. He is helping us with Scottish business today and will understand that Scottish Conservative Members are used to Opposition Members never answering any questions, especially those pertaining to spending or policy. The only policy the Labour party in Scotland has is not to answer a direct question. The hon. Member for Monklands, East is, as we saw today, a fine advocate of that policy. Indeed, her stridency has been curtailed by her throat or, perhaps, by the weakness of her argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party tried to suggest that the existence of the assisted places scheme means that there must be a divisive battle between independent education and state education in Scotland. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am a product of the state sector in Scotland. I went to school in it and taught in it. I see the assisted places scheme and the independent sector in Scotland as being wholly complementary. The cornerstones of Scottish education are choice and quality. For the Labour party, choice is okay for those who lead the party or sit on the Opposition Front Bench, but for Scottish parents, who simply want the best for their children, the Labour party wants there to be no choice whatsoever. The right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), who leads the Labour party, and many of his right hon. and hon. Friends have no problem about exercising choice. To them it is a fundamental right, but heaven forbid that anyone else should try to exercise the same choice! It is total hypocrisy and nothing displays that better than the attitude of Labour Members in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If any of the Minister's former pupils had applied for and been granted assisted places in a private sector school, would he not have been insulted, as their teacher, to learn that they were hoping to be better taught elsewhere?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. The hon. Lady is again displaying the truth of what I have said. To her, there is a battle—the state sector versus the independent sector. To her, everything is black and white and there should be no choice whatever. What kind of Scotland would she like to have? Not the Scotland that I return to every weekend where parents want only the best for their children. That can be achieved in various ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regulations govern the operation of the assisted places scheme and are technical. First—I shall say this quietly so that I do not upset some of my hon. Friends—they substitute metric measurements for imperial ones and provide that imperial measurements may be used as supplementary indications of distance for the purposes of the scheme. Secondly, the regulations lower the age limit for children who can benefit from the scheme to those aged five or who reach five by the end of February following the start of the school session. Finally, they

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that an organisation of which our nation is a member requires us so to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before continuing, I want to refer to two points made by the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute during her intriguing speech. I am sure that her hon. Friend the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon will be fascinated to know that the hon. Lady has never heard of her. I am assured by my hon. Friends from the south-west of England that that is also true of her own constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was intrigued by the assertion of the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute that her local council was having to cut further education bursaries. Is she unaware that a year ago we removed responsibility for further education bursaries from local councils to the colleges? It is difficult to understand how a council can send a brief to the hon. Lady stating that, for a year, it is taking responsibility for £30,000 it has never had before. The new council has never had that responsibility. The hon. Lady may have misunderstood the council's brief, or perhaps the council is trying to mislead her. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall give way to the hon. Lady if she wants me to. She does not, so I take that as an apology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assisted places scheme gives parents the opportunity to choose the education they believe best suits the needs of their children, regardless of personal financial circumstances. More than 11,000 children have benefited since 1981. The independent sector in Scotland has a proud tradition and has never seen itself as the exclusive preserve of the wealthy. It has always sought people from diverse backgrounds and for many years has provided bursaries and scholarships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, East asked my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes about opinion polls. Perhaps the hon. Lady would like to comment on the recent opinion poll carried out by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools which found that 65 per cent. of Scots, including 59 per cent. of Labour-supporting Scots, 63 per cent. of SNP-supporting Scots, 66 per cent. of Liberal Democrats and 80 per cent. of my party approved of the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us the size of the sample? That would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, the sample was the same as the one used for the recent System Three opinion poll on which she asked my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes to comment. The hon. Lady should check before she asks questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the sample?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sample was 760 people interviewed, which was the same sample as System Three used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents also appreciate the benefits of the scheme and turn to the academic results which the children achieve. Figures for 1995 show that 75 per cent. of assisted place holders gained five or more standard grade passes at grades 1 and 2, compared with 30 per cent. of pupils in local authority schools. At higher level, assisted place holders gained on average 3.5 highers at grades A to C, compared with 2.3 at grades A to C in state schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard the fascinating argument from the hon. Member for Monklands, East on what she would do with the money with regard to class sizes. She assured the Committee—I am sure that she did so in good faith—that it would go into reduced class sizes in the first three years of primary education. Does the hon. Lady realise that to reduce class sizes from the average of 25.8 to 20—I am sure she appreciates that that would be a sizeable reduction—would cost £17 million? That is more than the cost of the assisted place scheme; indeed, it is £15 million more than the £2 million that she would save in the first year. Given the instruction of her right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor that there will be no extra money whatever, will she tell the Committee where she will find the £15 million to pay for the pledge which she gave an hour ago?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an intriguing point. It seems that the Minister who is responsible for education in Scotland does not even know the class maxima in Scotland. That is a shameful performance on the Minister's part and I would be grateful if he would get down to answering some of the points that have been raised in the debate because, so far, he has not done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What have maximum class sizes got to do with the debate? The hon. Lady said that she would use the money saved to reduce class sizes in the first three years of primary school. In Scotland, in those first three years, the average class size is 25.8. I assume that the hon. Lady does not want to reduce it by 0.8 or 1.8; I assume that she would not make that claim unless she wanted to make a tangible difference. My assumption—perhaps I do not know much but I taught in schools for eight years—is that a drop from 25.8 to 20 would be a sizeable reduction and the minimum to make such a measure worth while. It would cost £17 million to do that. The hon. Lady would save £2 million from phasing out the assisted places scheme but, given what the shadow Chancellor said on Monday, where will she find another £15 million?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a bizarre performance from the Minister, who seems not to understnad that we have class maxima in Scottish schools.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is now committed to reducing class maxima but the average class size is actually lower than that. If that is what she is saying, she would do nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Can we get away from the issue of class sizes and return to the statutory instrument that we are supposed to be discussing. I would be grateful if hon. Members would stick to that subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for embarrassing the hon. Member for Monklands, East. She did not realise that the class maxima was higher than the average class size in Scottish schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is evidence that the resources used to fund the assisted places scheme could be redirected in some way, if the hon. Lady wants to follow that course. However, she refused to answer my hon. Friend the Member for Wantage, who asked her what the new burdens on local authorities would be. What will happen to opportunities for the many children who are currently in the assisted places scheme if it is phased out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister telling the Committee that the assisted places scheme, which will cost almost £9 million, is an absolute priority for Scottish education at the present time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have tried to tell the Committee that the assisted places scheme gives valuable choice to Scottish parents, and choice, quality and diversity are the cornerstones of Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee emphasised the costs of the scheme. Let us examine the facts. The average cost for an assisted pupil in 1995-96 was £3,572. The hon. Member for Monklands East, yet again, compared that figure with the published average budgeted running cost per secondary school pupil in Scotland of £2,708. I will send her the facts. Not only may the fees charged by individual schools not all be calculated on an entirely consistent basis but, more importantly, the published local authority school running costs do not include all the costs of running the school. Important items, such as capital and certain central administration costs, are not included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also reject claims that the difference between the cost per assisted place pupil and the cost per pupil in a state school implies that local authority schools are being underfunded. Local authorities have considerable resources at their disposal and, in this year's public expenditure round, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made education a key priority of the Government. If the local authority in the constituency of the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute is cutting expenditure on education, it is because it chooses to do so. I expect her local authority—and all others—to give education the same priority as that
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked the Minister several questions, but he did not have the courtesy to reply to them. In Scotland we set great store by courtesy, and Scottish teachers stress its importance.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the Minister is under some pressure and I shall be courteous to him.

The Minister's failure to respond to my questions is a discourtesy to the Committee and to the House. I do not believe that due care and attention has been given to the expenditure of taxpayers' money on the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the Minister's colleagues south of the border have researched the impact of the assisted places scheme in greater detail than the Minister. Research in Nottingham revealed that only 10 per cent. of those on the assisted places scheme come from a working-class background. Between 1980 and 1994, the cost of the assisted places scheme in Scotland rose by 1,300 per cent. while the number of places rose by only 400 per cent. The Minister failed to outline the provisions that have been made for monitoring and auditing and he failed to explain how 52 per cent. of those on the assisted places scheme had previously been in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several of my hon. Friends made pointed and relevant contributions. Sadly, that approach was not replicated in the contributions of Conservative Members. Today we have seen the contempt with which Conservative Members view Scottish education. I came to the Committee expecting to be impressed; I did not expect to leave it feeling that Scottish education had been pointedly insulted by Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
