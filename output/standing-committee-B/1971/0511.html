RESTRICTIONS ON SUPPLY BY PERSONS OTHER THAN THE CORPORATION, AND RELATED PROVISIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 27, in page 22, line 38, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"() The Corporation shall give their consent under subsection (1) above to the supply of gas, if—
<ol>
<li>the gas is a by-product of an industrial process,</li>
<li>the premises to be supplied are industrial premises consuming not less than 1 million therms per year, and</li>
<li>such premises are situated within a radius of 10 miles from the place of production of the gas,</li></ol>
and no conditions shall be attached by the Corporation to any such consent."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we will take Amendment No. 101, in page 23, line 6, leave out subsection (4), and Amendment No. 28, in line 36, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"Provided also that the Corporation shall not exercise their powers under this subsection without first giving the person manufacturing the gas the opportunity of applying for consent under subsection (1) above and, if consent is refused, where the gas is a by-product of an industrial process, of applying to the Secretary of State for an authorisation under subsection (4) above."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are now coming on to what I regard as one of the most important Clauses in this Bill. My Amendments which we are now debating, No. 27 coupled with Amendment No. 28, draw attention to the feeling in a wide section of the private enterprise industry which will be directly affected by the functioning of the corporation that there is a need for greater competition and freedom to sell gas produced within the private sector. The present legislation does not allow the oil companies to sell gases produced as by-products in the refining of crude oil at United Kingdom refineries without the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 948</span>
consent of the area boards. This has only rarely been given and the oil companies feel that there is a case here for some Amendment.<br><br>
If these Amendments are not accepted, oil refineries may be compelled to utilise gases less economically, and potential customers near to refineries may be denied the right of purchase.<br><br>
Under subsection (4) of this Clause the oil companies have the right of appeal to the Secretary of State if consent is refused, but the question arises as to what criteria will be adopted by the corporation or the Minister for giving or withholding consent and how this discretion would be applied. The oil companies on the whole feel that they should be allowed the opportunity to sell by-product gases direct to bulk industrial customers within a reasonably narrow area of the refinery.<br><br>
I should apologise for the somewhat sloppy drafting of the Amendment, which I can only attribute to my Parliamentary inexperience in these matters, but I do not believe that that in any way detracts from the sense or the meaning of the Amendment. If anything it clarifies it.<br><br>
The purpose of the Amendment is to allow the oil companies to sell by-product gases to bulk industrial customers within a radius of, say, 10 miles by mutual arrangement, and it is my belief that such a very modest infringement of the monopoly powers which are being incorporated into this legislation would be consistent with a national fuel policy and would also be within the spirit of the legislation.<br><br>
There are four reasons why I would hope that my hon. Friend would give these Amendments serious consideration. In the first place, these refinery gases, which, it is hoped, there would be discretion to sell direct to industry, are not compatible with the natural gas which the corporation sells, and it may well be far more economical to pipe these gases direct to industrial customers who are prepared and suited to burn those gases without having, through this legislation, to be forced to convert these by-product gases into a natural gas equivalent. This to me seems to make sense.<br><br>
Secondly, by our allowing this modest infringement of the monopoly powers, the refinery companies would be enabled to balance their refinery operations far more economically than they would be able to do if they were restricted unduly.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0767">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 949</span>
Thirdly—and this, I accept, may be politically controversial, but I believe the Committee ought to consider it—I believe that these Amendments would provide a modest stimulus to competition for the British Gas Corporation without seriously offending the monopoly powers which will be enacted.<br><br>
Fourthly, the Amendments, if adopted—and this I hope will appeal to hon. Members opposite—could well accelerate the development of industrial sites near refineries, and these are mostly in development areas where industrial development and employment are urgently needed. The industrial complex would be more economically unified through the facility of providing these by-product gases direct to industry. Milford Haven and Teesside are two areas where this could happen. This is an important consideration, because the restrictive nature of the Clause may hamper this type of industrial development.<br><br>
I firmly believe that if these Amendments are accepted in principle they will not in any way encroach on the gas industry's primary function, which is that of a public utility providing gas to the consumer. It is entirely consistent that at the same time this modest concession should be granted so that there would be slightly more flexibility, a little more competition and the obvious advantages of industrial development. I am a little frightened that if we are not prepared to accept these Amendments in principle we may see, over the coming years, industry making use of subsection (9) of this Clause in order to get round these restrictions.<br><br>
Of course, subsection (9) does allow the oil refining and exploration companies to dispose of their by-product gases and ether products if they are within their own group or among their own subsidiaries, and it is conceivable that oil refining companies will buy up industrial complexes or develop into industry, which they would not normally wish to do unless there were this slightly restrictive Clause regarding the disposal of their gases. We could have close to refineries a growth of monopolistic industrial complexes which might not make good economic sense except in so far as they would get the advantage of subsection (9). We would then get vertical integration and horizontal integration, in the physical
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 950</span>
sense rather than in the generally accepted sense, combined together, and I do not necessarily believe that this is a desirable way for free enterprise in industry to develop in this country.<br><br>
I recommend the Committee to consider these two Amendments, and not to assume that in posing them I am trying to make a major dent in the powers which are to be granted to the Gas Corporation to be the monopoly supplier and purchaser of gas. The purpose of the Amendments is to be constructive, and helpful to the industries concerned and to the economy as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr, T. H. H. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason for this discussion is that the new Corporation or the Minister simply refuses to define "gas". If my hon. Friend would only indicate what "gas" is under the terms of the Bill we would be clear of our difficulties, but this is not the case. He has quite readily defined natural gas from the Continental Shelf but when we come to gas here it can be chemicals or many other things. On the last occasion we heard from hon. Members opposite that the absolute monopoly, which the Gas Council as it now is, has about 69,000 industrial connections and 13 million domestic consumers. How extraordinary it is, on this occasion when we make a modest proposal that the oil companies should have an opportunity of selling tail gas over the refinery fence, which would make a minute dent in this grand monopoly, that there is complete opposition from Government sections.<br><br>
What does the Amendment propose to do? That where gas is a by-product of an industrial process the gas which is the result of the process, and which will not be utilised in the refinery, will be passed over the fence for further processing. It may be that the only use for it is to burn it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. E. Garrett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. This could be a very long, contentious debate on this Clause, I think we should get the philosophy of the hon. Gentleman quite clear. By the same token of his argument today, does he agree that the Gas Corporation will be allowed to refine crude oil which it may bring ashore as well?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member would not wish me to trespass into a field into
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0768">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 951</span>
which I am certain that you, Mrs. Jeger, would not wish me to go. My hon. Friend and I would be only too glad to have long discussions with the hon. Gentleman, and I would be glad to reciprocate if the occasion were appropriate. I very much regret to say that I just cannot go into that matter however tempting it may be.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
To continue my line of argument, it is a by-product which is not required by the refinery. It would be wasted unless it were utilised for further processing in a chemical industry or for under-boiler heating.<br><br>
The other condition would be that it would be limited to a certain quantity which should be not less than 1 million therms per year. Therefore, the Gas Corporation would have a complete monopoly outside this particular category. Also, it would be limited to a radius of 10 miles.<br><br>
Nothing could be more reasonable. This gigantic enterprise which we are bringing into being, the British Gas Corporation, says that its monopoly is going to be threatened, that it cannot afford to allow private enterprise to move into the field. I cannot think that the Minister, who has had a very distinguished career in the oil industry with Phillips Petroleum, will readily accept this proposal. I would have thought that, as he has done in the past with bridge building, he would think it might be a suitable occasion to compromise, to serve the Gas Council, as it is now, and also serve the requirements of private enterprise.<br><br>
My hon. Friend mentioned a moment ago that an oil company has a right to appeal, but if an appeal is made to the Minister, on what grounds is this matter to be settled? It could be settled by very capricious arrangements. It might be that the Minister, if there should be a Labour Government at a later date, would decide that on no occasion would an appeal be allowed. This would be extremely regrettable and in order to ensure that restrictions were not imposed unduly this should be the other way round: it should have the absolute right to distribute within a 10-mile radius.<br><br>
On 20th January of this year I read an announcement to the following effect:
<br><blockquote><p>"Conoco"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the Continental Oil Company—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 952</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"announced yesterday a contract to supply some 500m. therms of refinery tail gas over the next 10 years to Laporte Industries, producers of pigments and chemicals."</p></blockquote>
The report goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Conoco claimed to be the first oil company in Britain to sell refinery tail gas to private industry as prime energy fuel for a manufacturing process."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will confirm—will he not?—that the two plants are adjacent to each other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, those plants are very near to each other; I think the pipeline is about 4½ miles long.<br><br>
This would appear to be good sense, and according to the present law an application would have had to be made to the Gas Council for its assent, which must have been given. If that appeared to be reasonable, it might be prepared to concede further and grant the Amendment which my hon. Friend and I have proposed. It would be making the most economical use of the national resources. How can we afford in the United Kingdom to produce valuable gas which is of a lower calorific value than that which is required by the Gas Council? It is distributing about 1,000 B.T.U.s. If it is well below that, as my hon. Friend has mentioned, something will have to be done to bring it up to the required strength. If this is going to be regarded as a lean case, what is to be done about it? I would have thought it much more reasonable to arrange through local administration for this to be sold locally. Is there any point in putting in a middleman to dispose of it? Hon. Gentlemen opposite are only too glad to get rid of the middleman from time to time: why should they be so insistent on this occasion on keeping the British Gas Corporation in the middle?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rather gathered that we had a Conservative Government, and that it is the Minister who is resisting this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have to bear in mind that this is a democracy and that from time to time we have changes of Government in this country. I am confident that the Minister will look at this most carefully, but if there were a change in the Ministry, through a change of Government, if the hon. Member himself became Minister, I should be very concerned indeed, because I am not quite certain if any permissions would ever be granted.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0769">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 953</span>
That is the cause of my nervousness. I have full confidence in the Minister because he is able to see both sides, he has been in both fields and can appreciate these problems. The hon. Gentleman opposite is not quite so well placed.<br><br>
I think we stand in this position, that whereas in Section 9(4) of the Continental Shelf Act it is provided that where a gas is going to be utilised for chemical purposes consent will not be required, where it is to be utilised as a fuel consent will be required. That provision has been brought forward in Clause 29(2). We are simply saying here that there are difficulties of refinery balance in the United Kingdom. We produce primarily the heavier oils, unlike the United States, but certain percentages come out—such as the fuel oil, gas oil, gasoline, and so on—in certain proportions and there are tail gases which remain over after all this is done. It would help refinery balance if these could be disposed of, and any profits made from them would enter into the company's accounts.<br><br>
It is also most important—and my hon. Friend has stressed this in the Industry Bill which has been published today—to have around these refineries a number of satellite industries. I have in mind particularly Grangemouth in Scotland, which is in a development area. This could be enhanced and developed, and I would have thought that we would get a certain amount of support from the other side on this contention.<br><br>
The other Amendment is No. 28. If there were an appeal to the Minister it could be inhibited if the Gas Council were going first of all to pre-empt supplies. That is why this Amendment was put down and I hope my hon. Friend will read the detail of it most carefully and see whether he can meet us on that point.<br><br>
To summarise the conclusion very strongly indeed, the gas industry, in a P.E.G. study group in November, 1971, put its finger on the point when it said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Consequently a combination of high-priced but high-cost domestic sales, with low-priced and low-cost industrial sales is likely to provide the highest overall net revenue to the gas industry and the lowest overall resource costs for the community."</p></blockquote>
What we are saying here is this: let the National corporation have all the high-priced domestic sales and almost all the industrial sales, except within the 10-mile
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 954</span>
limit. This would balance its arrangements. All that is sought is to enable industry to make the most economical use of its own resources within a 10-mile limit, and I would hope that wisdom would prevail and the Minister would see the importance of conceding this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel that this is going to be an important debate, as the hon. Gentleman the Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Rost) said when he opened our discussion this morning. I should like to congratulate him and the hon. Gentleman the Member for Bedford (Mr. Skeet) on bringing forward these Amendments, although I am going to make it very clear that we on this side are very much opposed to them. However, we are glad that they have been brought forward so that we can have a good discussion and indicate in a total fashion our point of view on this question of utilisation of energy sources.<br><br>
The technical case, which is very strong, must be separated from the political case. I feel that the hon. Gentlemen who are responsible for these Amendments are acting primarily from a political point of view. I am not complaining about that. They have their principles and we have ours. The effect of this would be to bring about, even more than is the case already in the Bill as drafted, a creeping denationalisation, because it would be possible for there to be gas supplies to some of the most profitable industrial consumers over an area which it is now proposed should have a radius of 10 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Finsberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is making the point that the purpose of this Amendment is to encourage creeping denationalisation he is in grave danger of persuading some of us on this side that the Amendment is worthy of support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. Gentleman will vote in accordance with his principles, and it will be interesting to see him voting against his own Minister for once. We are quite prepared to encourage him to do that, but he must not expect that we shall vote with him, because that would be quite wrong.<br><br>
This, in practice, would be creeping denationalisation, and it would be very unfair to the nationalised gas industry. I do not take the hon. Gentleman's point that domestic consumers are necessarily
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0770">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 955</span>
the profitable ones; the large industrial consumers are extremely profitable because they are using large quantities of gas and it would be very unfair to the Gas Corporation to expect it to balance its accounts—and it is much criticised by the enemies of nationalisation, if it does not succeed—if important, fat, juicy industrial consumers were handed over in certain parts of the country, which could be extended—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a limited number of refineries, surely?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know. As energy supply develops, no doubt the number of refineries will increase, and there might be no limit to the number of pieces of private territory to which this could be extended.<br><br>
We might not have the same objection of the Gas Corporation were allowed to go into the oil refinery business; that would be genuine competition; but no, hon. Gentlemen on the other side do not want that kind of competition. The nationalised industry must be restricted, it must be a public utility, within a very narrow definition, to subsidise and assist, if necessary, profitable private industry, but it must not itself go into the oil refinery business. That is the great distinction which we make. If it were possible for the Gas Corporation to establish oil refineries in genuine competition with the private sector it could itself give special supplies in controlled conditions, it could itself undertake the development of total energy systems and district energy systems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument, we on this side of the Committee must never de-nationalise. We are not entitled even to rationalise. It seems to me that the sole reason he is now opposing us is that once nationalisation comes it works like a ratchet; it turns one way only; it must be more and more State control, not less. Is this the sum of the opposition?</span></p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member resumes, I hope that we can keep closely to the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad, Mrs. Jeger, that what I am saying is obviously exciting a great deal of antagonism on the other side. That shows that my arguments
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 956</span>
are sound.<br><br>
We wish to see the public sector developing on genuinely economic lines and, rather to the surprise of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Bedford, I never rule out competition between publicly-owned industries. It is easy to have an economy in which market forces are allowed proper play and, at the same time, to have competition between socialised or publicly-owned industries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend agree that neither the hon. Gentleman the Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Rost) nor the hon. Gentleman the Member for Bedford (Mr. Skeet) gave any examples of area gas boards being restricted at the moment, and is it not true to say that there have been no great areas of friction?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true to say that, and, given normal good sense between publicly or privately owned enterprises, good, convenient and economical arrangements can be reached. I do not wish to quote my own writings on this subject, but I argued in a paper which received a little publicity that what is incontrovertible is that there is scope for co-operation on the basis of mutual advantage, which does not contradict competition between industry, such as electricity boards, gas boards, oil refineries and other users and suppliers of energy. Sensible arrangements can be reached under existing conditions without the Gas Corporation being established. What we object to is the "Heads we win, tails you lose" kind of approach.<br><br>
I was interested to understand from what hon. Gentlemen opposite have been saying, that they will not necessarily have the approval of their own Minister in this matter. I suspect that there have been corridor conversations, and, indeed, the speech of the hon. Gentleman seemed to anticipate the Minister's refusal to accept the Amendments. No doubt he has consulted the gas industry very closely, but I do not know whether he has had representations from the oil industry. I also had the impression that the hon. Gentleman was somewhat irritated, in a curious kind of way, to find that he had to oppose a Conservative Minister when he would, no doubt, prefer to be opposing us. He may have that advantage rather sooner than he expects.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0771">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 957</span>
We are not opposed to sensible arrangements of this kind which, from the technical point of view, would add to the general overall efficiency of our energy supplies. What we object to are arguments which are technically sound in themselves being used to justify political principles. They are political principles which I know are close to the hearts of hon. Gentlemen opposite; but, equally, they must understand that we on this side have our principles, and we pursue the cause of public enterprise with as much strength as they pursue the cause of private enterprise. Let time, circumstances and the public judge between us. That seems to us in a democratic society to be a perfectly legitimate way of looking at this matter. No doubt, there will be further contributions from this side as the morning goes on, but our first reaction is that this is simply an excuse for creeping denationalisation, for a restriction of the public sector under unfair conditions to the advantage of the private sector.<br><br>
Perhaps I may refer to our own Amendment, although my hon. Friend will deal with it in great detail later. Amendment No. 101 seeks to leave out subsection (4), which is something new in gas legislation. That subsection gives to any person who produces gas as a by-product of an industrial process, who is refused permission by the corporation under subsection (1) to make use of it as he wishes to do, a right of appeal to the Secretary of State. In principle, I do not think one can be too hostile to a right of appeal. In the comparable electricity supply legislation, if an area electricity board wishes to generate its own electricity in competition with the C.E.G.B.—that is an interesting example of competition between two parts of the public sector—and the C.E.G.B. refuses permission, I believe it is possible to appeal to the Minister. The right of appeal to the Minister is not unreasonable, but we want to know the circumstances under which it is to be used and why it has now appeared for the first time. There have surely been examples in the past where it was the wish of private industrialists to manufacture gas for their own use and to extend its use, but a right of appeal to the Minister has not existed hitherto in legislation. Since I do not know of any disputes on the matter, I can only assume that general good sense and co-operation
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 958</span>
have prevailed between gas boards and industrialists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that this was not in Section 52 of the 1948 Act, but where a corporation has monopolistic powers is it wrong that there should be an appeal? Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that there should be no appeal at all and that this subsection should be deleted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman obviously did not hear what I said. I said that I was not against the right of appeal in principle, and that there were precedents for it in the electricity supply legislation, but when something like this appears for the first time we naturally want to know the circumstances which have brought it about. We want more information on it. That is a reasonable and proper duty of the Opposition. It is for that reason that we are proposing, for the time being at any rate, the deletion of this subsection.<br><br>
Having indicated our general reaction to the Amendments of hon. Gentlemen opposite, I can now defer any other remarks which may be necessary till a later stage. We are looking forward to hearing the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Peter Emery)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mrs. Jeger, Good morning.<br><br>
It is unnecessary for me to start by saying that I have looked carefully at these Amendments. One must do that with every Amendment if one is to make any success of one's Committee work. It will not be revealing any great secret if I say also that I have gone into very considerable depth in my consideration of these Amendments, because in some ways they are much more involved than some other Amendments which we have had to consider in Committee. May I go over the background so that it is absolutely clear, and then take up the arguments of my hon. Friends, because they are substantive arguments and, unless they can be properly answered, I shall have to give way? I hope my hon. Friends will see that there are basic reasons which, in overall consideration, make me ask them to consider the Amendments in a light which is, perhaps, slightly different from that in which they have propounded them so ably.<br><br>
Amendment No. 28 sets out to ensure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0772">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 959</span>
that the corporation cannot requisition gas until after the manufacturer has had the opportunity to apply to the corporation for consent for a direct supply, and where refused and the gas is a by-product to apply to the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 27 seeks to give producers of by-product gas an absolute right to make private supplies within a 10-mile radius to industrial consumers taking more than 1 million therms a year.<br><br>
The effect of the Opposition's Amendment, No. 101, would be to ensure that where the corporation has refused consent to a private supply the manufacturer of by-product gas will have no recourse to an appeal to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
In commenting on these Amendments, privately manufactured gas can be considered under two separate headings. First, there is gas which is not compatible with that being supplied by the Corporation, and which the corporation would, therefore, have no interest in acquiring. This is an important section with which I shall deal. Secondly, there is gas which is compatible with the natural gas which the corporation is supplying—in other words, the direct opposite of the first definition which I gave—or gas which can be economically processed to make it so, and which the corporation may require in order to fulfill its duty to provide a coordinated and economical system of gas supply and to meet all reasonable demands for gas. I have deliberately used those words, because that is the duty of the Gas Council which nobody will wish to question.<br><br>
The situation in the first example which I gave—that is, where the corporation would not wish to acquire the surplus gas—is already catered for in the Bill. The object of subsection (4), which Amendment No. 101 would omit, is to ensure that the corporation cannot adopt—what?—a dog-in-the-manger attitude to gas which it does not itself require, perhaps preventing the manufacturer from selling the gas at all so that it might have to be flared to waste, or unreasonably preventing him from selling it to the nearest or most profitable customer. I have listened very closely to the arguments put forward by my hon. Friends, but there are no grounds for asserting that the Gas Council has acted in this way in the past, or that the corporation would be likely to act in this way. Over the last five years, of which I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 960</span>
have had a specific study made, the gas industry has granted 19 out of 20 consents for which it was asked under Section 52(1) of the current Act. It refused only one scheme, which was a piped-lpg scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it has not refused them, what were the conditions to which the consents were subject? Also, if tail gas comes from Fawley refinery, where will it be economically processed to make it up to the right standard required by the Gas Council?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I deal with both of those points as I come to them, especially the tail gas point?<br><br>
Under the new corporation there is even less likelihood of cause for complaint, because there will be a common approach to the problem throughout the country, as there has not been previously with the individual gas boards. However, to avoid any suggestion that manufacturers will be at the mercy of the corporation—and I accept that that would be wrong, as my hon. Friends have said—subsection (4) provides for the manufacturer of byproduct gas who is refused consent by the corporation, or where consent is granted subject to conditions, to apply to the Secretary of State, who can himself authorise the supply, or alter the conditions which have been set.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there is a Labour Minister?</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I try to answer in my own way? I will deal later with the argument about who is the Minister.<br><br>
The position is that power is given to the Secretary of State to alter the condition if it is unreasonable; or, if the applicant believes the conditions set are unreasonable, he can apply to the Minister to alter them.<br><br>
The Amendment arises, I remember well, from discussions on the previous Bill when the hon. Member for Dearne Valley (Mr. Edwin Wainwright) raised the question of whether the National Coal Board or the British Steel Corporation would be able to dispose of surplus gas from their coke ovens. The reference for anyone who wants to look it up is cc. 601–2 and cc. 604 of the previous debates. At the subsequent Sitting of the Committee, the Minister at that time, the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0773">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 961</span>
Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Alan Williams), gave an undertaking that he could see the point in the argument. Therefore, we believed that there was some reasoning behind the argument. I believe that my right hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir J. Eden), who was dealing with this, took up that suggestion, and therefore subsection (4) of this Clause is a reasonable safeguard for the manufacturer of byproduct gas, and was accepted in principle by the previous Government, and was acceptable also, I am glad to say, to the Gas Council. Therefore, I suggest, that Amendment No. 101 is unnecessary and it is an interesting fact that the existing provision originally arose from the pressure by a Labour back bencher.<br><br>
I will now turn in a little more detail to Amendments Nos. 27 and 28. These are obviously designed to ensure that a producer of by-product gas, if the corporation does not wish to requisition gas in order to fulfil its supply duties, has an automatic right to supply it to industrial consumers who are both large and close to the point of manufacture. This is the nub of the argument. This proposal is based, it seems, to some extent on the proposition that the concept of a monopoly public utility is appropriate only for the small consumer and not in relation to the large consumer. Indeed, that point was taken in another way by the hon. Member for Bedford in his Amendment, which I was delighted to agree with at our Committee meeting on 4th May, when he realised the requirements of bulk suppliers to be able to meet the overhead costs of the domestic consumers.<br><br>
For some purposes the Bill implies a distinction between small consumers and the need to get the protection of the nondiscriminatory published tariffs, and the big consumers who, it is assumed, can look after themselves, but, in the context of this Clause, the proposition is that the gas industry's monopoly should not apply in relation to large consumers. That by this Amendment a specific point of competition will be established is open to considerable argument. The desirability of avoiding duplication by wasteful pipelining is obvious, and I do not have to remind my hon. Friends about that, but it is less the case in supplying large companies. The competition would not be fair. What my hon. Friends wish to have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 962</span>
is not unfair competition but fair competition. Therefore where we are able to supply large consumers with the minimum amount of capital outlay, that is what everybody in gas supply would like. But we are putting on the Gas Corporation an absolute duty to supply everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend could answer this by saying, if these Amendments were conceded, what loss they would put, in monetary terms, on the Gas Council. If it is minute he cannot say it is unfair competition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not know I had said it was minute. I have not said anything about minute. I will come to that part of the argument, but there is something else I want to say concerning this Amendment.<br><br>
It is not right that private manufacturers of gas, who have no statutory obligations, should be put in a position of being able, even in this very limited area, to pick up what may be part of the most profitable aspect of supply within that area, perhaps the most profitable consumers, and to leave the Gas Corporation to have to service the rest of the consumers. Also it could be seen to be in the public good in circumstances of shortage that all gas available should be integrated into the public supply rather than preempted, which it would be, by a particular consumer. The manufacturer cannot claim that he may suffer as a result of requisition of gas by the consumer at an unreasonable price.<br><br>
I have tried to show that it has not happened in the past and I do not believe that there has been enough evidence presented by my hon. Friends to convince me that it is likely to happen in the future. Even if there were that fear and there were a dispute as to the treatment or conditions, and this would obviously include the price, it could be settled by the Secretary of State after inquiry, and indeed, after a report by an independent person, as enshrined in subsection (8). His decision would represent, and would obviously be based upon, a reasonable price, taking all considerations into account.<br><br>
For this reason and other reasons the Government consider it right that the corporation should retain the right to requisition the gas which it needs to meet its supply duties. The manufacturer's right to appeal to the Secretary of State
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0774">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 963</span>
under subsection (4) is not intended to cut across this right but to apply only when the corporation is unwilling to take the gas itself. This is an important point. The manufacturer would be held to ransom if the corporation were unwilling to take the gas and then unwilling to grant a licence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the question of deciding that the corporation has the right to acquire gas if it can establish the need to maintain supplies, who will be the judge of whether there are adequate supplies and whether reserves are adequate? Will there be an opportunity for anybody to challenge the corporation if it says it needs the gas, and other independent experts, or oil companies, say that that is nonsense and that there is plenty of gas available?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously this is a matter which the Gas Corporation would have to take into account to meet its obligations statutorily set by the Bill. We must bear in mind that we are hoping in the Bill to set up a structure which will last for many years. While there is no need now to requisition tail gas or other gases from private industry, in 25 years' time the amount of natural gas available from the North Sea may be nothing like as it is at the moment. Then there may be a very much greater need to consider the tail gas position. As an oil man, my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford will know that the aspect of tail gas can be considerable—the effect of the striking of the crude and so on. I do not want to go into that argument now as I do not think it will be necessarily helpful to our debate in this Committee, but it is an important matter to be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary is doing so well and I am agreeing with so much of what he is saying—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then something must be wrong!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—that I hesitate to interrupt him, but he made a reference to the suggestion that there should be a 10-mile radius. I do not know whether he has had his mathematicians working this out, but working it out quickly in my head, it gives a total area of something like 100 square miles which would be exempt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Astronomical figures.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 964</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not worked out the exact area mainly because it is not a question of whether it was 10 miles, eight miles or 120. What really matters is the principle, and the principle I am trying to evolve is that the private producer should be able to ensure that he can get a reasonable price for that which he wishes to sell and that he would not be held to ransom by a monopoly trying to do him down. I believe we go all the way in doing that in the Bill.<br><br>
What my hon. Friends want is an assurance and explanation that under the Bill, particularly with the new subsection, private enterprise will not be held down by very large monopoly. As long as the Committee is kind and wise enough to resist the Amendment moved by the Opposition, the type of assurance my hon. Friends seek is enshrined in the Bill already.<br><br>
I refer now to one or two points raised individually by hon. Members. The sale of chemical feedstock was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South-East. It is quite clear that there may be some problems of definition here, not definitions of gas but definitions of the chemical feedstock aspect.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bedford raised the question of the definition of gas. The 1965 Act provided for automatic consent for supplies for non-fuel purposes, and I am delighted to be able to say that in practice no difficulty has arisen over the lack of definition of gas. This was confirmed by the C.B.I, and the Chemical Industry Association in consultation early in the year. I do not have to remind my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford, who is an old enough hand in this, to know that if we had been able to produce a definition for gas, the whole industry and the Ministry would have been delighted, but it is because that has not been possible that my hon. Friend is, I think, praying to the wind a little—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following my hon. Friend's argument. I proposed a definition during the passage of the Continental Shelf Act. Why does he then define "natural gas" in the definition Clause but not define "gas" at all? It would help the chemical industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see that my hon. Friend is taking the advice of another hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0775">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 965</span>
of mine, the Member for Worcestershire, South (Sir G. Nabarro), who always says, "Never ask a question unless you know the answer". My hon. Friend the Member for Bedford knows the answer. The reason is, of course, the geographical factor of gas from the North Sea where we are not falling into the problems of the chemical feedstock aspect.<br><br>
Because of this and the chemical structure of gas and its application we have not been able to get a definition acceptable to the Gas Corporation, to gas users, and to the gas industry. We have had to exist in this situation, and my hon. Friend realises that.<br><br>
The second point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South-East was on the matter of competition, that this Amendment would bring the stimulus of competition to the Gas Corporation. If I honestly thought that to be a basic argument I would go much further with my hon. Friend than I have been able to. I do not believe this will be a competitive factor. It would mean that some of the cream could be taken over by a private supplier if consent were withdrawn, particularly if there were a shortage in future. However, competition comes, not between two dealers in gas, but between gas and other fuels, and this is the answer. In this instance, particularly for that amount of fuel in B.T.U.s, the only competition is not between gas and gas, but between electricity and coal and the Gas Corporation.<br><br>
I have tried to deal with the position of the tail gas situation to some extent. It is important, and I only underline it because the advice I am given is that every time consent has been applied for in respect of tail gas it has been given. If I thought other than that I would be most concerned, because this is a useful form of heating fuel, and I would be very worried if I thought this were not the case. If my hon. Friend can produce examples where this is not the case I should be delighted to look at it again.<br><br>
We come to the Amendment strongly propounded by my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford with the argument that it would be a service to private enterprise. Basically, that would be true if there were a restrictive part of the Bill, but as the Bill will enshrine for the private sector, when these sources of supply are granted, the right to dispose of it at a price they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 966</span>
can negotiate, there is nothing further the Government should be asked to do to guarantee the position of private enterprise. I cannot see an argument which has so far been put forward which says that approval for supplying this gas has involved price restraint or that they have not been able to dispose of it. If that argument had been mounted, the monopoly would be acting in a grossly unfair manner against the private sector, but I do not believe that that is true.<br><br>
I dealt with the hon. Member for Bristol, Central (Mr. Palmer) on the question of competition, and I must deal with this question of creeping denationalisation. If any man believes that this Amendment, concerning this amount of gas, is creeping denationalisation he is living in Cloud Cuckoo Land. Hon. Members are, and they know it, but it was a good political point. I shall leave it at that without more comment, because we have been able, strangely, to keep political dogma out of this, I am delighted to say, and I do not want to have to bring it in.<br><br>
The Amendment would take out the power of the Minister, and we would never run into the problem that a bad Minister could back up a bad corporation acting badly. I use those words exactly. It is essential to have the words which would be deleted by Amendment 101. This is the kernel of the argument, that if one had a corporation and a Minister acting badly we would be in a serious situation. I give that point absolutely to my hon. Friend, but that is not what has happened. The one thing I could say about the Gas Council is that it has always acted in the most responsible manner. I do not always say that of every nationalised industry, but I believe it of the Gas Council, and irrespective of whichever Minister of Power, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, or Minister of Technology we have had, we have always had Ministers who have been most concerned with the industry themselves. Therefore, that is one argument I cannot answer, and I have to say to the Committee that the traditions of the House, the traditions of the Government, and the traditions within the industry, are the only safeguard. History has so far proved them a reasonable safeguard, and I have every reason to ask the Committee to believe that that would be the case. While I cannot answer the argument directly, it is unlikely that this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0776">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 967</span>
would go wrong. I can say no more. It is the duty of this Committee and not just of the Government to safeguard the situation of the Gas Corporation, but it is right, at the same time, to ensure that private enterprise in this area is not being unfairly treated. It will be seen that consideration has been given fully, and I hope the Committee will take that view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a result of what the Minister has just said, I can keep my remarks short. He made a devastating case against accepting Amendments 27 and 28—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do not embarrass me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—and in consequence I do not need to spend much time on those two Amendments, but I was pleased to hear him say that over the past two years there have been very few refusals of consent and that both Amendments were seeking to do something which was already fully met and catered for in the gas industry. We are grateful for the information that out of 20 applications, 19 were accepted and the twentieth was only refused in exceptional circumstances. I support the Minister's tribute to those in the gas industry and on the Gas Council and area boards who have had responsibility in these matters. They act responsibly, and no undue restrictions are placed on the peripheral activities in private industry which has gas which it wants to sell independently. On that basis we can be satisfied.<br><br>
I was tempted to go into the whole of fuel policy, but that would not be wise at this stage. However, perhaps I might be permitted, in passing, to say that to write into this Bill restrictions of this kind, or criteria such as are in the Amendments, would be entirely inappropriate at this stage, particularly as the Secretary of State seemed to indicate on 6th March that a profound study would be made of fuel matters. To start to write a restriction into this Bill now would be wholly unnecessary.<br><br>
The Minister rather took my hon. Friend to task for suggesting that the two Amendments by his hon. Friend could be creeping denationalisation. He said this was not the case, but the Clause, in subsection (4), gives the Minister tremendous powers. There is no doubt that, if there were a big row raised by an independent producer of gas or somebody
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 968</span>
who thought he wanted to go into the supply of gas separately from the Gas Corporation, and if the Minister were disposed to allow it, he has by subsection (4) all the powers he needs. That could be creeping denationalisation in a very big way.<br><br>
On the face of it we, on this side, do not object to an appeal. Obviously, if the Gas Corporation were being unreasonable, there should be a possibility of appeal to the Secretary of State, to ask him to intervene and to examine the circumstances. I do not know what the circumstances will be in future or how the gas industry will develop, but there could be someone producing gas, and under that subsection the Minister could set up or allow to be set up something in direct competition, on an impressive scale, with the Gas Corporation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think it would help the hon. Member's argument if I tell him that it has been pointed out to me that these powers only arise where the corporation does not want the gas itself, and that is a different factor in the argument. He is right if the corporation does not want it, but that is hardly creeping denationalisation, is it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful intervention for which I am grateful.<br><br>
The only thing I need to say on Amendment No. 101 is that we shall want to watch and monitor the operation of this subsection to see to what extent this provision is being used, as, no doubt, will hon. Gentlemen opposite. On the basis that it is no more than an appeal procedure we are quite happy to withdraw our objection in the form of our Amendment, but we shall want to watch this provision very closely, and from time to time I hope we shall be able to seek information from the Department of Trade and Industry, when the new corporation is set up, to see how many appeals the Secretary of State has considered. I hope we will be able to put Parliamentary Questions on this matter. It will be of crucial importance.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
We are very pleased to hear the Minister say that the Amendments Nos. 27 and No. 28 are unnecessary and unacceptable. We support him in that view, and as far as our own Amendment is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0777">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 969</span>
concerned, in view of the assurances which have been given, we need not press it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee has been as impressed as I have by my hon. Friend the Minister's detailed and informative reply. His comments will also be widely appreciated by the industry and by those mostly concerned who have raised these anxieties with regard to this Clause.<br><br>
They are particularly pleased that the Minister mentioned that 19 out of 20 applications to the corporation have been granted, and I would like to confirm and emphasise from my own experience of the industry—which I appreciate may not be as lengthy or involved as that of hon. Members opposite—the 100 per cent, cooperation and commercial attitude which is adopted by the Gas Council at the moment with regard to the supply of gas to bulk consumers in industry. The council's approach to this, in my experience, is developing in a most constructive way as the supplies of gas increase and the demand for those supplies also increases. That attitude, I believe, offers great promise for the future economic development in this country of natural gas for industrial use and particularly for local on-site generation of power and chemical application. Therefore the anxieties which have been expressed on these Amendments have so far not been justified.<br><br>
The point of the Amendments, as I explained earlier, was to emphasise that under subsection (4) the Minister has this discretionary power, and it is reassuring to know that at the moment we have a Minister who will use that discretion, with his experience of the industry, in a way which would not be criticised by either party, but the phrase "if he thinks fit" always raises a niggling doubt because in future years we may have another Minister. No doubt the present Minister will not be there for ever; he will undoubtedly be promoted; and we might even have a Government with a different political outlook.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Soon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some Ministers "think fitter" than others, but still, with that slight doubt at the back of my mind, I feel we have the assurance and the safeguards in subsection (4) in that the indus-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 970</span>
try can appeal to the Minister. If we had a Minister less co-operative and less sympathetic to the industry we would still have the opportunity to raise the matter through Parliamentary Questions, through scrutiny and debate. A decision which appears to be unfavourable to the sensible development of the industry or private enterprise could be criticised through the democratic Parliamentary process. With that I feel considerably more assured than I was before putting these Amendments. I feel that the Minister has gone further than one could expect in explaining that these matters are adequately covered in the existing and proposed legislation, and with the approval of my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Mr. Skeet) I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garrett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that even at this stage of the debate I could make a few observations without incurring your wrath, Mrs. Jeger.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Member. I have immediately to put it to the Committee that leave be given to withdraw the Amendment, but if the hon. Member wishes to speak that leave cannot be given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garrett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was the subterfuge of my standing up. I do not wish it withdrawn. I am very disappointed at the statement made by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Rost). Since he was elected to the House we have not had an opportunity to vote together on such matters and I thought he tested the feeling of this Committee to the limit. He is rather like the man for all seasons; he changes his tune so rapidly on this Committee that it is difficult to follow the logic of his political philosophy. Are there different politics involved in this Amendment or the other two we are discussing? It is regrettable, because I personally would have voted for the hon. Member's Amendment. There is a lot of sense in it. It is very logical. It gives the hon. Member and the hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Skeet) who supported him an opportunity to exercise their political initiative. Then we reach the situation when the hon. Member asks leave to withdraw. I think the Committee should not allow the Amendment to be withdrawn. This
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0778">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 971</span>
has been fully debated and those of us who participated—myself only a little—and the Minister would be rather disappointed that such an Amendment should be withdrawn. The opinion of the Committee should be taken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bob Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to follow on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend (Mr. Garrett). Unlike him, I would like the opportunity to support the Minister. The Minister made an excellent case in regard to Amendments 27 and 28. Had the Minister not made such a good case I am sure that hon. Members on this side of the Committee would have abolished the argument put by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Rost) supported by his hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Mr. Skeet).<br><br>
The Minister in his reply talked about the lack of political dogma in the debate we have had today. Surely the Minister does not seriously suggest that hon. Members on this side would be delaying the Committee purely for the purpose of political dogma?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where is my white sheet?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must protest. To make this suggestion is insufferable. The Minister is a nice man and would not wish to impute such things to my hon. Friends and myself. I can assure the Minister that all we are interested in is making what is basically a fairly good Bill into a lot better Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend not agree that even in politics one man's dogma is another man's common sense?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and this brings us to the question of definition. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. You would not look kindly, Mrs. Jeger, on my proceeding further into the definition of "dogma" and "common sense" so we will leave it there.<br><br>
I get more and more amazed as this Committee proceeds when I think in terms of the Second Reading debate and the fire in the belly stuff which the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South-East and the hon. Member for Bedford came out with on the Floor of the House. It seemed that they were going to tear the Minister to ribbons on things on which they felt keenly and which they were not prepared to let go easily.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 972</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paper tigers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Paper tigers" is a reasonable description of them. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, South-East is rapidly qualifying for a title in this Committee. I am not suggesting he is going to be kicked upstairs to the other place because of his conduct, but if anyone is rapidly qualifying for a title it is he, and the title must be the title of Mr. Head-stand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garrett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it my hon. Friend's view that this infection which attacks Government Ministers is spreading to the lower ranks of the party? We get a change of decision each day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This has less and less to do with by-product gas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to draw my remarks to a finish. My hon. Friend has been less than just. My hon. Friend is in fact giving me a reply as to why the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South-East is engaged on those sorts of convolutions in the course of this Committee. It seems that it is contagious, transmitted from Cabinet Ministers who have done so many headstands since the last election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garrett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Give examples.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks me to give some examples, but I am grateful for the fact that we have a very patient Chairman, and I do not propose to try her patience any further.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 29, in page 23, line 36, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where any requirement is made under subsection (5) or (6) above, the price paid by the Corporation for gas supplied to the Corporation shall not be less than the cost to the Corporation of their alternative supplies of gas at the point of manufacture of the gas to be supplied."</p></blockquote>
This Amendment is very straightforward indeed, and I hope the point which is raised here has already been virtually accepted by my hon. Friend the Minister. The purpose of the Amendment is to ensure that the corporation would pay a clear market price for any gas which the corporation agrees to buy or forcibly buys from refineries. Obviously it is most important that, as a monopoly purchaser, the corporation does not abuse that power, particularly as we have just
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0779">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 973</span>
seen on previous Amendments that there will be a restriction on alternative sales of private enterprise gas, other than to the corporation. Therefore it is essential that—to use the expression used by the Minister—the dog-in-the-manger attitude is not applied to adjacent refinery gas simply because the corporation is aware that the product of the private source cannot be sold any other way and is not suitable for any other purpose and, therefore, squeezes down the price because there is no alternative.<br><br>
12.0 noon<br><br>
I have no doubt at all, considering the way the Gas Council has operated so far, that it would not dream of abusing its powers, and I have no evidence of any case in which it has tried to do so. That is why this Amendment is not intended to try to correct some abuse which is already going on but to ensure and provide in this legislation long-term assurance that a fair price will be paid on a continuing basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the Committee and my hon. Friend. I fully understand the point of this Amendment, and we have debated it to some extent because it was automatically part of the last Amendment. I fully understand this position as regards price, and in so far as the objective of this Amendment is to ensure that the price paid by the corporation for gas acquired under this Clause is a reasonable one I think my hon. Friends may be reassured that the Bill already does this. It provides for this in the terms and conditions—which must, I would stress, include price—on which the supply is to be given, and, in default of an agreement, the action of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry following an inquiry and report by an independent person. That is in subsection (8). The price so fixed would take account of all relevant factors.<br><br>
Part of the weakness of this Amendment is that it rests on only one specific relevant factor, and there are many—quality, reliability, the availability of alternative customers, and the capital cost to the corporation. What I really want my hon. Friends to take on board at this stage is that, because of the right to appeal to the Secretary of State where the terms and conditions—and although price
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 974</span>
is not stressed, the terms and conditions must in all legal interpretations include price—</span></p>
<p><i>And the Chairman's attention having been called to the fact that six Members were not present she suspended the proceedings; and another Member having come into the Room, and six Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Therefore I can give the assurance that price must be included in those words "terms and conditions".<br><br>
Perhaps my hon. Friend would like to consult anybody who is concerned with this, because I realise that he is well informed on the matter and, if he can produce any further evidence that would make me consider that the assurance I have given to the Committee today is not adequate, I will look at this again. However, all the evidence I can obtain at the moment leads me to say that I believe the terms within the Bill meet, absolutely and completely, precisely the point my hon. Friend is making.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for his detailed explanation. I do not regret having raised the matter by moving this Amendment, and I am sure his remarks will be noted among those who are concerned. With the assurances he has just given the Committee, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 50, in page 24, line 30, at end add:
<br><blockquote><p>"(12) This section shall not apply to natural gas got in pursuance of a licence under the Petroleum (Productions) Act 1934 (including a licence under that Act as applied by section 1(3) of the Continental Shelf Act 1964):</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Provided there is an agreement by the holder of a licence and the Central Electricity Generating Board for the supply of natural gas to the Board as a fuel for any power station of the Board up to but not exceeding 1,000 million cubic feet per day or such quantity of gas as the Minister may in his discretion determine."</p></blockquote>
We now come to a very important Amendment which I thought should be on the Paper so that it could be discussed bearing in mind that this matter is being determined by the Government. I am quite certain that Members on the other side of the Committee will be interested in it, although we only find one present at the moment.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0780">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 975</span>
The advantage of the modest proposals outlined here for more natural gas to be used in the power stations of the C.E.G.B. can be elaborated by pointing to the situation in Europe. My suggestion is that if they utilise natural gas to any extent in their power stations there is no reason why we in the United Kingdom should not follow a similar practice.<br><br>
Taking the case of the Netherlands, the 1975 position is likely to be something along these lines for domestic sales. That allocated to the gas distribution companies will be 17 billion cubic metres, to power stations 13 billion cubic metres, to large factories 10 billion cubic metres. Therefore, of total home sales 32.5 per cent, is going to power stations, and the operating company, indicates that, by 1975, 75 per cent, of the total domestic demand will be generated from natural gas and this will remain the position till the 'eighties, when it is likely that nuclear energy will take over. I am aware of the fact that there may be a tight situation for the time being in Holland.<br><br>
There are many more areas of the North Sea which must be investigated most carefully. However, on the basis of reserves, it is quite capable of feeding power stations in the United Kingdom to a modest extent, as the Amendment has suggested.<br><br>
This is the comparative situation of the reserves. In the United States, where there are many power stations powered by natural gas, reserves are 260 trillion cubic feet. In Canada, they are 61 trillion cubic feet, and it is interesting to note that the reserves in Canada are exactly the same as in the Netherlands—60 trillion cubic feet; in the United Kingdom, English basin, 32 trillion cubic feet and the entire North Sea estimated at 55 trillion cubic feet.<br><br>
I am quite certain that the Minister is not going to suggest that there is an insufficiency of natural gas in the North Sea. The company with which he was associated for many years has been very lucky in the Norwegian sector, and negotiations are going on for an agreement in the near future between Phillips Petroleum and the C.E.G.B., if the price is right. Therefore, I think this should be taken seriously.<br><br>
Before leaving the Netherlands, the figures for 1970 are as follows: oil 61.5 per cent., solid fuels 9.5 per cent., coal right down, natural gas 29 per cent. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 976</span>
figures for 1980 will be, in the same order: 57 per cent., 2.5 per cent., natural gas will escalate to 38 per cent, and nuclear energy will be 2.5 per cent.<br><br>
Very quickly I will give the primary energy requirements for power stations in the E.E.C. for 1975: oil 29 per cent., natural gas 11.3 per cent., coal and lignite 35.8 per cent.<br><br>
Arising from all this, the contribution of oil to electricity production will exceed that of coal for 1975. Natural gas will be rising fast and the largest users of natural gas for energy production will be West Germany, the Netherlands and Italy.<br><br>
As regards electricity generation in Belgium in 1971, 27.6 per cent, of total requirements came from natural gas, 52 per cent, from petroleum fuels and 19.7 per cent, from coal. That is roughly 100 per cent.—actually it is a little short. In Italy, 8.9 per cent, of total gas supplies are fed to power stations. That is the figure for 1970.<br><br>
In France, the Lacq supplies were covered by agreements in 1957 and 1958 under which the Electricte de France took as much as one-third of the total supplies. This was amended in 1961 to a retrocession of part of the natural gas quota. But they are still utilising natural gas in at least six power stations.<br><br>
In Western Germany, of course, the use of natural gas for power stations has been going up considerably.<br><br>
That leads me to the United Kingdom position, and this must be taken extremely seriously. The Government have been extremely slow by not facing the advantages which are likely to accrue, of which I should like to stress one or two. If they use gas instead of completely using coal up to a tonnage of over 6 million per year—although I understand opposition may come from certain quarters—the advantages of natural gas up to the figure I have put down in the Amendment will be lower specific heat consumption owing to smaller auxiliary demand; reduced investment cost because of lower construction expenditure and simplified design; relatively short construction times and better adaptation to load forecasts; less air pollution—a very significant point—and less corrosion of the plant and facilities because there is little sulphur in natural gas; stations can be dual fired by natural gas and oil, and dual-fired stations can be controlled much more effectively than
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0781">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 977</span>
stations using coal or simple automation because there is a system of perfect combustion; fewer operational personnel and lower operational costs because the periods of maintenance have been substantially cut down; greater security of supply because of reduced dependence on external conditions—as natural gas is sent by pipeline it is unaffected by frost; and—we have had recent experience of this with a labour-intensive industry—there are fewer strikes: we all know about the problems of the coal industry and I am not going into that, but the gas industry is less affected. No storage is required for natural gas. No washing of flue gases is necessary because there is no sulphur going up the chimney, there is no fly ash to be disposed of, and, if we will bring in power stations for this purpose, we can maintain or sustain a high load factor, which is essential.<br><br>
That is the background for the general case. It is essential that we in the United Kingdom adopt a forward-looking policy, and if European countries can adopt this there is no reason why we should not do so.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
Let us look at the energy balance in the United Kingdom in 1970. It was, oil 44.5 per cent, of the total; solid fuel—that is, coal—47 per cent.; natural gas as low as 5 per cent.; and nuclear and hydro 3.5 per cent. By 1980, those figures are likely to rise respectively to 53 per cent., 20 per cent., 18 per cent, and 9 per cent. Therefore, it is noteworthy that there will be a very substantial expansion of gas sales, and in order to maintain high load factors electricity generation will be used.<br><br>
In answer to a Question which I put down, we found that the production of natural gas in 1971 was 18 billion cubic metres. I indicated earlier that home sales in Holland total 40 billion cubic metres. Therefore, we are producing half that rate. Yet if Holland can put 32.5 per cent, into its power stations, there is no reason why we should not put in very substantial amounts up to the figure which I have indicated in my Amendment. I am not suggesting that we have all this availability at this moment, but we can go well beyond the quantity which is currently being employed.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 978</span>
In 1970–71, 0.4 million tons of coal equivalent was used in gas power stations, which is exceptionally low, and we all know the reason for that. It is in order to protect the monopoly of coal; it is in order to ensure that coal has a very significant outlet in one of the few realms which are left to it.<br><br>
The Minister now has minimum supply contracts which will bring him in approximately 3,225 million cubic feet per day. He is receiving at the present moment 2,500 million cubic feet per day, and the figure is rising to the point where the minimum supply arrangements will be reached. He has ample fuel coming into the United Kingdom, and will certainly have enough to sustain the figure which I have put forward in my Amendment.<br><br>
That would help the industry, and would help the public by reducing costs considerably. It is quite noticeable that prices continue to rise, and the electricity industry says that if its basic costs go up it must pass on very much higher charges to the public. If the public want reduced charges, the cost of fuels which are being let into the power stations must be reduced, unless one gets down to an agreeable energy mix of the form which I have indicated.<br><br>
It may well be that, as a result of the inquiry, the Minister will come to the conclusion that between 1978 and 1979 the megawatt capacity will be something of this order, which I recommend: coal, still approximately 38,000 megawatts; oil, 15,000 megawatts; nuclear, 9,000 megawatts; gas, 4,700 megawatts; other, 3,800 megawatts. That would be a satisfactory mix, but it would mean that natural gas would be lifted to 23 million tons of coal equivalent from the 1970–71 figure of 0.4 million tons of coal equivalent.<br><br>
The only argument which the Minister can put forward today is that he must continue to protect the coal industry. He can still do this, because he can ensure that with the increasing supply of electricity all of the increase will come from other fuels which are available. He will then say that there is an insufficiency of supply of natural gas from the North Sea. He knows very well that that is not the case; that if the estimate is 55 million cubic feet there is much more to come. The Gas Council and Amoco have been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0782">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 979</span>
looking around and have found some rather useful deposits in the North Sea. Amoco is also associated in one deposit with the Phillips Group in the Norwegian sector. A large part of the North Sea has not been looked at carefully and, if there is an abundance there, it is not much good saying to this Committee today, "We cannot afford to allow the electricity industry to diversify even to a limited extent". The figure which I have put down is extremely modest.<br><br>
Why not help this industry which wants this clean fuel? We are in an age when the quality of life is important, when we want to get rid of sulphur dioxide. One of the great faults of coal is that it has over 3 per cent, sulphur content. Here we have natural gas coming from the Shelf, which is 94 per cent, methane and has no sulphur in it. Why not use it to a limited extent? If Europe has given the lead, why can we not also give a lead here?<br><br>
May I mention this in reference to Torfelt and Ekofisk? There will be available ,as an associated product of oil, something of the order of 1.000 million cubic feet of natural gas, which will either have to come to the United Kingdom or go to the Continent. Why cannot the C.E.G.B. have that availability? If it is prepared to pay a reasonable price for it, which I understand it is, why should it not have it, even though it may mean earmarking something like four or five power stations for conversion to natural gas? I am quite certain that hon. Members opposite, who have listened to one or two of my remarks, agree that it is reasonable to suggest that the C.E.G.B. should be given flexibility in its fuel supply. This would not be unduly injurious to the coal industry, and it would certainly make provision for the future when, as the gas runs out, if we fail to make very considerable discoveries in the next 20 years, nuclear energy will be in a position to take over.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Mr. Skeet) for moving this probing Amendment, because it allows us to have a slightly different debate from that which we have had previously in this Committee, on a slightly wider topic. The Amendment has a considerable number of technical defects, but I do not intend to bore the Committee by reading out a list
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 980</span>
of five or six, which I know was not in the mind of my hon. Friend.<br><br>
First of all, I would deny that any Government, either this or the previous one, have been extremely slow in their development of natural gas in the North Sea. It is probably the fastest turnround in any area of the world from exploration to development in the use of natural gas. It is important that that should be said and understood quite clearly.<br><br>
Secondly, my hon. Friend may have been saying that we were slow about its application into the electricity power industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, I shall not be quite so dogmatic. I should have thought that that argument could be made. I do not deny it, because we are still not up to the 4,000 million cubic feet a day which was projected in Dick Marsh's White Paper, which was presented by the Labour Government. But when one considers that our present known reserves are four times less than the known reserves at Groningen—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sixty trillion and ours is 32 trillion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will not argue about the figures. They are considerably less.<br><br>
It is intriguing to note that in the Dutch Press at the moment—and I was in The Hague only two weeks ago—there is considerable concern that the estimated reserves at Groningen will not reach the previously published figures. Therefore, I would reject the suggestion that we have been extremely slow, when we have already taken some action of which I intend to give some details, and when the Gas Council's level of need has not yet been negotiated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the reserves of Groningen are 60 trillion cubic feet and our reserves are 32 trillion cubic feet, and if the percentage devoted to power stations in Holland is 33 per cent., why can our figure be, if not a half—because the daily production has not reached the top level—a quarter of that? If it were a quarter, that would bring the figure up to 7 or 8 per cent., which I should have thought very considerable. Also, let us remember that while the production in Holland is very considerable, at least half is going for export.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0783">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 981</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to get bogged down in a debate about the Dutch situation, because if I pursued that for long I should be out of order. I must point out that reserves are not an absolute fact in relation to nothing else. These are in relation to the Dutch demand in a nation which is four times smaller than our own. Therefore, the structure is entirely different and is not parallel with the situation in this country. If I may use the French position as an example, they were over-committed in their natural gas supplies to power stations, and they subsequently regretted it and had to buy back the contracted supply. Surely that is not the sort of situation into which we want to get, although I am not for one moment suggesting that that is what my hon. Friend has implied.<br><br>
The situation is not quite so simple, as the rather sweeping broad brush, but very interesting presentation which my hon. Friend gave the Committee would make it appear. In fact, I noted down that it seemed to be the shortest major electricity fuel policy which I have ever heard propounded and we shall have to look at it again in that light, rather than in the light of this Amendment.<br><br>
It will be useful to take into account the existing position in relation to the supply of natural gas to power stations in this country. Hams Hall is dual-fired with coal and is already being supplied with natural gas. West Thurrock is also dual-fired with coal and is already using gas to a limited extent, although it is still in the process of being converted. When the latter is fully converted, they are expected to use together about 275 million cubic feet a day, which will make the C.E.G.B. the largest United Kingdom user of natural gas as a fuel. That can hardly be called extremely slow. Further conversions would be a matter for the C.E.G.B. in the first instance. No applications are at present before the Government for further conversion. If any more are made, they will, of course, be considered on their merits.<br><br>
The C.E.G.B. is potentially the largest but not the only potential large bulk user of gas and is able to take supplies on a fully-interruptible basis, which is obviously of great interest to the Gas Council. Such interruptible supplies are a valuable means whereby the gas industry can match the demand for gas with the availability of supply. The supply of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 982</span>
gas to bulk industrial users is normally a matter for commercial negotiation between the industry concerned and the gas industry, with the latter having regard to the availability of gas and the claims of alternative markets.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
In the case of supplies to power stations, Ministerial consent is required before a new power station can be built or an existing one converted to burn a different fuel. The Secretary of State, before giving consent, has in the past and would have now to consider the implications for the coal industry as well as the gas industry and the electricity industry. While I understand, and I know my hon. Friend will know how well I understand, the argument for an extended use of North Sea Gas there are other considerations. We have to be concerned particularly with the economic effects, with massive public money which has had to go into the subsidisation of coal burnt in the electricity industry in order to support the coal industry. I am not criticising that at this moment in any way, but to allow a situation of <i>carte blanche</i> for the supply of natural gas to the C.E.G.B. without any consideration of these other factors would, as I am certain my hon. Friend would agree, be wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary help the Committee? Assuming that coal has more or less the guaranteed market which it has at present, and assuming the United Kingdom needs a lot of additional electricity in future, will he permit the C.E.GB. to import from abroad natural gas or L.N.G. from foreign suppliers in the quantities which it wants and allow it to use it in natural gas power stations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are getting very involved and quite a long way from the Amendment, but I can try to answer my hon. Friend in a way which will not hold me to ransom to him and yet still be sensible.<br><br>
Conversion or an application for a new station must be approved by the Minister. That is not at the moment before the Minister, and I intend to hide behind the useful Parliamentary disguise of saying that it seems to me to be a hypothetical question at the moment, and while it is hypothetical I do not think I could or should answer it, but my hon. Friend is not to think that the whole matter is not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0784">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 983</span>
under very careful consideration. Of course it is. It would be absurd of me to try to give the impression that it is not. The position that my hon. Friend mentioned of fields not within the British Continental shelf are not covered by the Amendment, and, therefore, any detailed answer would be out of order, but, of course, in the same way this matter is under consideration, and he must realise it would be wrong to go into detail.<br><br>
This whole matter is of the greatest concern. Matters of conservation have to be considered. We have had no discussion on the conservation of natural gas anywhere in this country. I have found that this is a weakness and something to which, as time goes on, and I do not have to spend Tuesday and Thursday mornings in this Committee, I may be able to give some thought within the Ministry. In the same way, the overall energy structure of the nation, the Opec nations, and the position of oil supplies are a considerable problem. We are continuing to consider this whole matter fully and completely, and this is a matter which every Minister who has been concerned with the power industries has always in front of him.<br><br>
I am only too pleased to assure my hon. Friend that the debate is useful in that it has allowed people to understand that the Government are dealing with what is a massively complicated, involved and intricate problem. The different balances are not financial or international, but domestic or social or problems of employment. The whole thing is in the widest possible field and not just the narrow aspect of this Amendment. The debate has been useful, and I thank my hon. Friend for initiating it. Of course he will understand that I have not gone into the legalistic arguments against the Amendment, and I am certain that he would not have thanked me for so doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise to the hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Skeet) as I was out for a little time and did not hear the beginning of his speech. It is on a theme which is, with my electricity interest which I declare, close to my heart.<br><br>
I thought that in his demand that the electricity supply industry should take in natural gas at the rate he was suggesting without let or hindrance was making him somewhat more royalist than the king. I do not think that the C.E.G.B. or Scottish
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 984</span>
boards have ever demanded that kind of freedom. I take the view, which may not be supported by my hon. Friends, that natural gas, a new source of energy, should be available to all the fuel industries. I have always objected, as an electrical man, to the gas industry having a monopoly of the wholesale taking in and at the same time being the retailer. While it would be out of order to continue with this now, I have argued this already, and I made this point on Second Reading. I would have preferred to see a natural gas marketing agency which would have made available to all the fuel industries the advantages and benefits of natural gas. The electricity supply industry must have reasonable freedom to choose between the four primary sources of energy which are available now to it. This was conceded in the Labour Government's Fuel White Paper of 1967. The four sources are coal, which is the primary source, and likely to remain so for a long way ahead, nuclear fision, oil, and now natural gas.<br><br>
The hon. Member is, perhaps, right if he is suggesting that future power stations are carrying through an industrial process and using natural gas and turning it into kilowatt hours in the same way as any other industrial user is turning it into a product such as furniture, machinery and so on. Therefore, I am of the opinion that a power station should be treated as a normal industrial user. This may be of benefit to my hon. Friends who are concerned with the coal industry, because there could be dual firing, and this would mean that there would still be a considerable use of coal. There may be circumstances where the load on the gas system is such that it would not be necessarily available and coal would be used. So from the point of view of the coal industry, dual firing by coal and natural gas would be preferable to having a nuclear station where there would be no dual firing. This is a suggestion to which the coal industry should not be strongly opposed, and I do not think that it is.<br><br>
Where I part company from the hon. Member emphatically is when he suggests that this kind of arrangement should be reached without the Minister having the normal power of intervention.</span></p>

station? Should we not allow the C.E.G.B. to look after its own affairs without Government intervention?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the first point, the Coal Board has arrangements for gas exploration and is working with oil companies, but its more important role and more historic role is as the main producer of energy, and it employs a great number of miners. The Coal Board has very widespread obligations to the mining community. Its partnership, reluctantly conceded by the party opposite, in natural gas and oil exploration is a relatively minor matter. We must have in this country—and there is no dispute in principle between the parties on this—some kind of co-ordinated and organised fuel policy. There must be ultimate power of Ministerial intervention, and the Minister must be able to say that there are some circumstances where he is not prepared to concede a turnover of a power station to natural gas because it does not fit in with the prior planning of the fuel economy as a whole.<br><br>
I have considerable sympathy with the point of view of the hon. Member, but he spoilt his case by taking it to excess. The practical effect of his Amendment would be that those holding a licence, apart from the Gas Corporation, could make their own independent arrangements for supplying the C.E.G.B. I cannot say I am terribly enthusiastic about that. This is biasing the scales very much in favour of the private sector to the detriment of the public sector. I am arguing, instead, for a balanced but reasonably flexible fuel policy.<br><br>
Having declared my interest and expressed my personal point of view about the use of natural gas, I think the Minister is right to reject the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garrett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, Central (Mr. Palmer) that the Amendment should be rejected, I congratulate the hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Skeet) on the logic with which he presented it. It shows he has done his homework in relation to the argument he was advancing on the use of natural gas by the C.E.G.B.<br><br>
However, I am pleased the Minister has decided to offer some corrective views because as the hon. Member for Bed-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 986</span>
ford's argument was advanced I was beginning to feel apprehension. His views would have been received with horror in the mining areas. They would have viewed them with dismay. If carried to their logical end there would be less coal used in the power stations. The Minister made a half-sentence when he said that the social consequences would have to be considered. I suggest that the social consequences, especially in the North-East, would be appalling and would counteract completely the economic position of the Coal Board who depend on long-term contracts from the generating boards for their basic economy and efficiency and they equip themselves accordingly.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the point must be that if the National Coal Board continues to sell, in the next 10 years, the same quantity of coal to the Central Electricity Generating Board while other fuels take over the growth in electric power, the miner is not at a loss? Will the hon. Member accept that view?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garrett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are getting dangerously close to a debate on fuel policy. It was hinted at by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, Central and by the Minister. It would be useless to do so, because Governments have never been able to have one, and it would be pointless for a modest Committee like this to discuss it. The Coal Board would like a larger slice of C.E.G.B. requirements in future, but whether it gets it is a matter for ministerial decision.<br><br>
I am pleased that the Minister showed awareness of the dangers of the Amendment because while it looks extremely desirable on the surface, beneath it are awful implications. Therefore I shall oppose the Amendment, but the hon. Member for Bedford should be congratulated on moving it because if we had a national policy there would be some merit in the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I echo the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend (Mr. Garrett) because the hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Skeet) has done a service in putting the Amendment down as it has afforded an opportunity of debate on this matter of much importance to all the fuel industry.<br><br>
I support the line taken by the Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V002P0I0786">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 987</span>
and my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, Central (Mr. Palmer) that it would be unwise to try to write this provision into the Bill, and the Minister is right in resisting it, but on 10th March we had a debate on fuel policy initiated by the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr). The question of North Sea gas was discussed. I was pleased when the Minister referred to the situation developing in France where they are seriously concerned about gas supplies, and on 10th March there was an article in <i>The Financial Times</i> which said:
<br><blockquote><p>"A serious shortage of natural gas is beginning to hit French industry. The problem will become acute by 1975, with supplies running out and demand rising at a rate of around 20 per cent, a year."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While the Lacq field in south-west France has only limited supplies, France is importing from Holland and will later import from the Soviet Union, so that there will be no shortage as these supplies are brought in. Therefore that article is not quite accurate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell the hon. Member who wrote that article but it was in a serious journal which would not treat such a matter in a frivolous way.<br><br>
The last thing I want is that we in Britain should get into uncertainty, and the Minister is right. We need to go carefully in this matter. Neither can we assume that natural gas will be cheap. The cost of installation, maintenance, and the laying of pipelines will be extremely expensive, and there is no guarantee that it will be cheaper than indigenous coal. So we need to look at the matter extremely carefully before we go ahead.<br><br>
Gas is a marvellous fuel, and we need to explore its potential and to try to estimate its life. The most interesting thing in the debate on 10th March was the reply by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) who spoke for the Government. If anybody is a freebooting free enterpriser it is the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury, but he was extremely cautious on that occasion. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The known and proved gasfields on the United Kingdom Continental Shelf are expected—so far as is known—to reach a yield by the middle '70s of 4,000 million cubic feet per day, which is the equivalent of about 15 per cent, of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 988</span>
our fuel requirements."—[Official Report, 10th March, 1972; Vol. 832, c. 1881.]</p></blockquote>
He went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"I also confirm that the known discoveries are unlikely to last for more than 20 years. After that there will be a decline in yield from the known gasfields."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 10th March, 1972; Vol. 832, c. 1882.]</p></blockquote>
I well understand the hon. Member's point, that this only relates to the known reserves, but great caution was expressed by the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury on 10th March, and I think that is the right approach. This has to be exploited as quickly as possible, but we have to know where we are going.<br><br>
I am pleased that the hon. Member for Bedford made the point in an interjection in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend when he said that he foresaw a situation where the C.E.G.B. would be maintaining its coal take. I do not know how this will go, and I do not want to be accused of over-optimism, but I hope it is the situation, and that at some stage the Government will confirm that they are developing their thinking for the future. When the hon. Member was talking about the coal industry and the use of coal in power stations and used words about its being dirty and filthy it was a good thing that my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) was not here because he is Chairman of the Miners' Group and that would have been enough to give him the glennie blink and you, Mrs. Jeger, know all about the glennie blink.<br><br>
The Government are right. We have to move to a fuel policy based more and more on indigenous fuels like natural gas, and increasing the supplies of natural gas will be extremely important, but to allow the C.E.G.B. to use it willy-nilly without considering all the implications would be wrong at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skeet</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I indicated earlier that this was a probing Amendment and I am obliged to the Minister for one or two indications of his thinking on this. I hope the Government will accelerate the formulation of their views and take them before the House so that we may have a little rationalisation in this. In view of that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

This is quite a short Amendment. It has come to light since the Bill was published that there could be some doubt in the wording, and these are Amendments to remove doubt and to regularise current practice. They are to ensure that the physical act of stamping a gas meter, provided for in this Clause, need not be carried out by the meter examiner in person but may be carried out by someone else acting on his authority. This is the normal practice at present, but there was a possibility of a legal quibble in this matter and we wanted to make it clear.</span></p>
