The object of this Amendment is to meet a point which was overlooked by the Government when drafting the Bill. As paragraph (	<i>c</i>) stands houses which were under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
the original Acts have only 5 per cent. placed on them the first year and after that another 10 per cent. Houses brought in now for the first time have 15 per cent. placed on them at once. Houses brought in for the first time are obviously intended to be houses of a higher rental, but the Government have overlooked the fact that houses which include shops are brought within the limits for the first time. Therefore, as the Bill stands, a house of which the front room is used as a shop, even if the rental is only £10 a year, will have the full increase of 15 per cent. imposed at once. Surely that is not intended! It is for that reason that I put down this Amendment, but I am prepared to withdraw it if I receive an undertaking to meet what is obviously an injustice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir KINGSLEY WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will under take to look into the matter, and, if there is the point which my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel NEWMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move in Sub-section (1, 	<i>c</i>), at the end, to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>Provided also that tenants who could have claimed protection under the Act of April, nineteen hundred and nineteen, had they been able to use their rateable value alone as a test, shall be charged an increase of five per cent. only on their net rent for the first year under this sub-section.</p></blockquote>
The case which this Amendment is intended to cover is such an obvious injustice that I imagine the Government will have to meet it in some way or other. When passing the 1919 Act we did our business very badly in the House of Commons. We meant to enact that where the standard rent or rateable value was under a certain limit, the tenant should get the protection of the Act. We failed to do that. We have this anomaly at present.
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
You have houses under the 1915 Act, if the rent or rateable value did not on the 3rd of August, 1914, exceed the limit of £35, £30 and £26, but when you come to the 1919 Act, the position is somewhat reversed. A house is exempt from the Act if the rent or rateable value on the 3rd of August, 1914, exceeded £70, £60 or £52. So in one case the house is within the Act, if the rent or rateable value did not exceed, and in the other case the house is excluded if the rent or rateable value did exceed. That was an anomaly which was quite unjustifiable, and it was commented on by the Salisbury Committee. On page 10 of their report they remark:—
	<br><blockquote><p>It was held in 	<i>Isaacs</i> v. 	<i>Tittlebaum,</i> 149, L.T. 84, in reference to the rental limit of £70, that rent meant the whole sum which the tenant agreed to pay as rent, and not merely the balance after deducting so much as was payable in respect of rates.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The effect of this is, supposing there are two houses exactly similar in all respects, if one was let at (say) £55, the tenant paying rates, it would be within the Acts, but if the other was let at £75, the landlord paying rates, it would not be within the Acts. We think that this anomaly should be removed, and that the protection of the Acts should be afforded to a dwelling-house, if either the rent or rateable value is less than the prescribed limit. As the law stands at present, if the standard rent exceeds that figure the house is outside the Acts, whatever its rateable value. It may be observed that in making this recommendation we are reverting to the method of fixing the limits adopted in the Act of 1915.</p></blockquote>
Imagine a man occupying a flat at a standard rent beyond £70, but an assessable value below £70. He was excluded from the 1919 Act against the wishes of Parliament. The result was that the landlord acting within his rights was able to raise that man's rent from £75 up to, we will say, £95. Now this particular occupier comes within this Bill, and the landlord will be able to raise his rent from the present £95 to whatever the limits of the Act are. That will mean, say, that his rent will be put up from £95 to £125, or in less than two years his rent will have gone up from £75 to £125. Because we have made that mistake, we want to rectify it and enact in some shape or other that the landlord shall not be able to increase that man's rent by more than 5 per cent. the first year as set out in paragraph (	<i>c</i>) of Clause 2. I would like the Government to give us some idea as to how they intend to justify this injustice, if they desire to justify it, which has been perpetrated under the 1919 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The MINISTER of HEALTH (Dr. Addison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will not expect me to justify anything which the hon. Member says is an injustice which was perpetrated by Parliament in times past. What has happened under this Bill is that we have accepted, and I think quite properly, the recommendations of Lord Salisbury's Committee, that where either the rent or the rateable value is less than the figure named, then it falls within the scope of the Bill. Previously that was not so, and there were cases where the rateable value was less, and the rent was more, but the case conjured up by my hon. Friend with some ingenuity is entirely imaginary. In any circumstances the, increase of rent permissible would only be the fixed percentage of the net rent—that would be the rent in August, 1914, after deduction of the rates—and so the case which he has imagined of a man's rent going up from £75 to £125, is entirely imaginary. If a man's net rent were £75 in fact, while he had been charged on £95, his gross rent included rates, and therefore his net rent was £75. The maximum increase to which he can be exposed under this Bill by all the accumulations put together would be 40 per cent. on £75, which would be very much less than the figure which he has mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only effect of this Amendment would be to limit the class of property on which, under the provisions of paragraph (	<i>c</i>), 15 per cent could be charged in respect of mortgage interest, etc., during the first year of the operation of the Act, that is the premises brought under the Bill for the first time. All other premises can only be exposed to an increase of 5 per cent. in respect of this head during the first year. So we shall have these two sets of cases, first the cases which were frankly above the previous rental limit, or the previous rateable value limit, and then a number of border line cases which would mean endless complications and difficulties. We have provided that where they come under the Act for the first time, with all the limitations that a person exposes himself to once he increases the rent at all, that rent immediately becomes comparable to the rent paid in August, 1914. Subject to these limitations, these premises now coming in for the first time may be charged this 15 per cent. That is a clear definition, it is a workable definition, and I think we ought to keep to it. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
Amendment would redress no injustice and would only introduce many needless complications. If it is not improper, may I appeal to Members, as this is a very complicated clause in a complicated Bill, and there was general concurrence and goodwill at the last sitting that we should try to finish to-morrow night, may I very respectfully ask Members to remember that we must make our remarks as short as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel NEWMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw my Amendment I will put it down on Report in a better form,. because it is a matter of some importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. LOEKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1, 	<i>d, i</i>), to leave out the words: "dwelling-house is one to which Section fourteen of the Housing, Town Planning, &c, Act, 1909, applies, or where in any other case the tenant is not under any express liability," and to insert instead thereof the words "landlord is responsible."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of this Amendment is to do away with legislation by reference. To my mind nothing is more confusing in an Act of Parliament, or in any other document, than always to be referring to previous Acts of Parliament. The words I wish to omit seem to me absolutely unnecessary. I have been looking up the Acts. First of all there is reference to the Housing and Town Planning Act of 1909, and that merely says that the landlord shall keep the house in repair in a state fit for human habitation, in certain cases which come under this Bill or in any other cases. There is another Act of Parliament, that of last year. There again it merely says that the owner of any house suitable for occupation, etc., shall keep the house in all respects fit for habitation. As far as I am aware the only definition of repairs comes under those two Acts. It simply says that the house shall be kept in all respects fit for human habitation. The Amendment seems to me to be much simpler. It simply says "where the landlord is responsible for repairs" That is exactly what the two Acts of Parliament did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Further Amendment made: In Subsection (1, 	<i>d,</i> i), leave out the words "equal to," and insert instead thereof the words "not exceeding"—[	<i>Dr. Addison.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The next four Amendments standing in the name of the hon. Member for the Duddeston Division (Mr. Hallas) and the hon. Member for Central Edinburgh (Mr. W. Graham) cover the same points. I understand that the hon.

Member for Central Edinburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. GRAHAM</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1, 	<i>d,</i> i), to leave out the words "twenty-five," and to insert instead thereof the word "five."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand I may be quite in order if, looking beyond the immediate Amendment I have proposed, I refer to the one which is fourth in the list, which provides for a grade of 5 per cent. spread over three years. The whole controversy on. this Amendment is stated in a single sentence. The Bill provides in this particular Clause, I think, an amount equal to 25 per cent. increase. We propose by our two Amendments to reduce that amount to 15 per cent. and to spread it over three years to the tune of 5 per cent. each year. Let me be candid and say at once that we should not have pressed it in this form if we had got any concession at all under the preceding Clause, but that preceding Clause was carried by a majority in the form in which it was presented by the Government, and from our point of view we still think that the Bill must be modified for the protection of tenants. This is an opportunity of saving at least 10 per cent. in what may be added to the rent under the conditions of this Bill. The right hon. Gentleman will probably ask, and he is entitled to ask, why in view of the fact that I have already supported a policy of repairs, I should now propose to do anything to restrict the allowance made. I do it for the reasons I have given already, but also because no substantial injustice will be involved in reducing this amount. One reply that may be offered to that, is that unless we get the sum of 25 per cent. down it is very unlikely that the repairs will be done or that any arrangements will be made to do them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
Against that I say that if we can get the repairs done and if at the same time we could make the position as easy as possible for the tenants, that would be the stronger policy in the matter. Twenty-five per cent. down to landlords, carrying with it the idea that repairs will be immediately undertaken, leads us nowhere at all, because we all know from the side of labour and materials that it is a physical impossibility to get the repairs undertaken, and that in any case in this country repairs must be spread over a considerable number of years. That being so, it is not unreasonable to give 5 per cent. the first year and 5 per cent. additional in each of the succeeding years, because during that time they will be able to start repairs or will be guaranteed an ultimate 15 per cent. On that ground, and also keeping in mind the physical proposition, I think there will be no interruption or delay in effecting the repairs, and the position undoubtedly will be easier for the tenants. I am very unwilling to detain the Committee, but I can put in some strong evidence supplied by the assessment authorities in Glasgow with reference to the ultimate and aggregate burden which will fall on house tenants under this Bill. I still entertain the hope that the right hon. Gentleman will modify this Clause and grade the increase over three years, and so ease the position of the tenants in a direction which would not jeopardise the repairs and would certainly make acceptance of the Bill a little easier for the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised in a compact form the main issue which arises on this Clause, and I am glad that he said he was discussing it in the light of other Amendments, which would be consequential. I hope, therefore, that we can have a general discussion of the various alternative schemes put forward in connection with this Amendment. My hon. Friend has spotted the weak case in his own arguments, and he has put up an ingenious counter-attack. What is the purpose of this proposal? Frankly, my purpose and the purpose of the Government is to try to get repairs done to existing houses, apart from what we can do for new building. As the hon. Member said, apart from the physical factor to which he referred, the 5 per cent. increase in rent in order to enable the landlord to execute repairs would not meet the necessities of the case. A rent of 10s. a week
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
would be represented by an increase of 6d. a week. That is not going to enable a man to execute repairs to property. As a matter of fact, we have to remember that the average proportion would not be that figure at all. It is the net rent to which we are relating this, the rent after the rates have been deducted. So that the percentage increase would on the average be a much lower figure. With regard to the vast bulk of property let at rents of 6s. 6d., 7s., 8s., or 8s. 6d. a week, which is often a compounded rent, 5 per cent. will only be 2d., 3d., or 4d. a week, and it would be quite inadequate. It would be no inducement to get repairs done. You would charge the tenant the extra percentage, and he would get nothing in return for it in the way of repairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our policy is to make the best use of the housing accommodation that exists, and to get it put into repair. If we are to have that policy running through our proposals, we must make the scheme of the Bill adequate. To split up the increase and spread it over three years would not achieve the end. In the first place any limit of time in which you could call upon a man to have repairs executed would have to disappear, because if it was a gradual increase spread over the three years, you could not expect him to have discharged his full liability with respect to repairs in, say, three years, or some long period of time. Therefore the time limit would have to be abolished. I suggest that for at least two out of the three years the tenants would get nothing for the increased charge. I do not believe that with the increased cost of doing work two and a half to three times is an immoderate estimate. I think that is quite a moderate estimate. I think it is probably at least three times, and, unless you make some allowance which will enable a man to execute those repairs, the thing is futile. A large number of landlords of this class of property, although some are big ones, are quite impecunious, having no big funds to draw upon, and, unless you allow something reasonably substantial, you will get nothing. Then there is the case of hardship, and I agree that is the point, of course, on which my hon. Friend based his Amendment—that it is too big an increase to make right away. But we have got to face the grievance. We have it one way or the other. He proposes spreading
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
it over three years, whereas I propose it straight away. Why have exacerbation of the grievance? I agree it would be very troublesome. If we have to face this issue and put these houses into repair, we have to take the necessary steps. I dare say it will be very unpopular, and I dare say the Minister of Health will be execrated from one end of the country to the other in making these proposals. Anyhow, we have to face it, and I ask the Committee to support us in sticking to the proposal in the Bill. We may have a big difficulty for the time, but it is better to face it than to spread it over three years, with a repetition of this annoyance to the tenant at the beginning of each year. On the whole, the inconvenience and trouble will be less by facing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to give whatever help I can by making this increase contingent upon the repairs being executed, and, therefore, if necessary repairs are not executed, I do not want the tenant to pay an extra 25 per cent. You have a definite line to work upon if you do it at once, whereas if you spread it over three years there is no criterion. With regard to the physical difficulty, I think that is my hon. Friend's best point, but I would point out that, according to the Census we took not long since, 60 per cent. of the building trade was then engaged on repair work—some of it, I am sorry to say, was luxury repair—which I understand is a very remunerative class of work, and, therefore attractive. If we could get anything like 40 per cent. of the building trade employed on our houses we should have a much bigger percentage. I wish we could get the balance, but if we have 60 per cent. of the building trade repairing houses which want repairs of this type, it is a real contribution to the Housing question, and I would be glad to get it. I wish, instead of building garages and extending retail shops and things of that sort, a good many were employed on this work, and if we could get them diverted to work of this sort it would be a great advantage. I think you had better face the grievance and deal with it right away; otherwise there will be no machinery for doing repairs and paying for them in the case of a large number of landlords. Therefore, although I would like to spread it out, I think it is better to face it now, and I appeal to the Committee to support our proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir COURTENAY WARNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think there is a great misunderstanding on this subject. I remember the Mover's speech on the Second reading in the House of Commons, and on that occasion he put forward the argument that landlords had benefited to a large extent by having all their houses let, and by various things during War time. It is quite true that the houses were let, but what has been the real position of the landlord during that time? I do not want to hold up the landlord as a virtuous being who ought to be protected in some sort of way, but I think the estate with which I have something to do is conducted on business principles, and always with consideration to the tenants, and I would put in a fair estimate of what the landlord has suffered. The accounts for 1913–1913 show a gross rental of £102,000 and a net profit of £31,400, in our accounts for the year under review—that is last year—the net rental was £116,000, which includes the increase rent allowed for the increased rates, and the net profit, instead of being £31,400, was £23,000. Not only does that cover the whole prewar costs—and I may tell you that this estate has been managed, not on a rack rent system; we could have put the rents higher if we had chosen to do so just before the War—but there has been a dead loss for the last year, and the repairs to-day are costing just on three times as much as they cost before the war. It is all very well for people with large capital, as my hon. Friend said, men who have got their money invested in various things, and can afford to plank down the money to do the repairs in the hope of getting back their money in the future. A great many landlords in the country are not in that position at all; they are dependent on their rents, and when you only give them 5 per cent. to start with, they cannot put anything in because anybody who will lend money requires that the property shall be profitable in the future, and therefore they cannot borrow the money. The man not having enough to put into it, because the rent is not sufficient, nobody will trust him, because the security is not good enough. That is a very serious position. I do not want to press it, but I want to show what it means to the poor landlord, and the great majority of these houses are held by people who are not rich people. I refer to the people who have a few houses
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
in the country, having put their savings into them, as they thought it a good investment in days gone by.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another thing. If you take the whole of this 40 per cent.—because I am taking the 10 per cent. which will come next year—which the landlord will get in two years, it will only put him in about the same position as he was before the war. That is not a very brilliant state of things, because everybody else is getting 2 per cent. more for his money at least, and he will not get as much as that. I want to clear up a point which has been very much misunderstood, and that is what this 25 per cent. and 30 per cent. mean. I want to have it quite clear. Thirty per cent. really means 18 per cent. on the standard rent, and the 40 per cent. would only mean 25 per cent. It comes to this, that if a man is paying a pound a week, and at the end of next year he has had the whole 40 per cent. increase on the net rent, it will mean, not an increase of 8s. a week, as it would appear to be, but an increase of 5s. a week. Supposing a man is paying 10s. a week rent, it will mean, not an increase of 4s., but an increase of 2s. 6d. I think if you put the actual facts it makes it quite clear to anybody. I myself regret that the Minister ever introduced the question of net rent. I think it would have been much clearer to put it on a standard rent, and we should not have had the Scottish difficulty either. As it is, I think it is quite clear that this is a reasonable amount, and it is the minimum amount that will enable the small landlord to effect repairs. If you give him less than this, he will neither have the credit nor the money to do it. Although I do not suppose all landlords will use it to the full extent, I think under the present circumstances almost all landlords have been such heavy losers on this sort of property that they will put it up to the 40 per cent. I do not want to argue for the landlords or for either side, but I want the Committee to know the case quite clearly, and I think putting the actual facts shows what this Bill means better than anything else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I desire to support the Amendment with regard to this introduction of net rent. If the Minister works it out in London, taking the rates at about one-third of the rent, he will find that about 15 per cent. of the net rent is almost equal to 10 per cent. of the standard rent where a landlord pays the rates. Poorer people are under some anxiety, as they think this increase is a great deal more than it actually is. If for London, at any rate, the Minister made alterations in the Bill, and said 15 per cent. in the one case and 10 per cent. in the other, it would work out almost the same, and prevent a great deal of confusion. I desire to support the Amendment, because I think 25 per cent., in addition to 15 per cent., amounting to 40 per cent. in all, is too great an increase to put on in one lump. During the war, it must be remembered, landlords have done far less repairs than they ought to have done to fulfil their legal obligations. They have got that to do, and it is too much to ask that they should put the whole increased burden of back repairs on a tenant at once. The Minister of Health says that this increase is necessary in order to get repairs done. If I follow him correctly, his view is that, unless you give this bait to the landlords, the work is not likely to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us see. Take London. Nearly every landlord within the meaning of this Bill is himself a leaseholder, and is under covenant to repair to the freeholder, and I know quite well that the freeholder does see that the property is kept in a very fair state of repair. 	<i>So</i> it is not a question of the poor landlord who cannot afford to do the repairs It is not fair to say that unless you pay him he cannot do the work because he has not got the money. It is solely a question as to what is fair and equitable to allow him because of the increased cost of repairs. I suggest the present proposal is a great deal too large. Take the Government's proposal as it stands. Will this get the landlord, who is not very keen
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
to do his duty, to carry out the repairs at all? What is the proposal? It is not to give this 25 per cent. additional to do the repairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel NEWMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon. He is going to have a three months' run under a subsequent Amendment standing in the name of the Minister of Health. When he has been paid this 25 per cent., and if he does not do the repairs, he has to go to the County Court and get relief. Speaking with some knowledge and an experience of these Acts in the past, and acting for both landlords and tenants, I say it is a most unlikely thing for a tenant to take upon himself the risk of quarrelling with his landlord and embarking on litigation in the County Court. If this Clause goes through as it is there will be a large number of tenants who will not have the courage, for various reasons, to go to the County Court to appear against their landlord. After all it is not very pleasant to quarrel with your landlord, because if you are 24 hours in arrears with the rent he may put the brokers in—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is provided for in a later Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those concerned will be grateful, and there will be no question of going to the County Court for an order to suspend it. I hope some words will be inserted to make the landlord's right to the 25 per cent. conditional on putting the property in repair before he gets the increased rent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel NEWMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to introduce controversial matters at present, but I do think that we are now drifting back again to what I call the housing of the working-classes state of mind. We are not the whole time thinking about the working classes in this Bill, or ought not to be. The hon. Gentleman below me talks about 10s. and 15s. per week rent and about weekly rents, and hon. Members opposite say the same, but we are dealing also with houses which are inhabited, dwelt in, and occupied by people who do not at all belong to the working classes. We have to think of these people. Let me point out, in this particular proposal, the right hon. Gentleman has departed from the recommendation of the Salisbury Committee, because,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
that if he will turn to page 4 of that Committee's report, he will read as follows—
	<br><blockquote><p>5. While, however, we consider the rents should he increased forthwith we are impressed with the hardship of the case of poor tenants whose income has increased very slightly or not at all since 1914, and yet who may be required to pay not only increased rents but increased rates upon a scale wholly beyond their means. We suggest that this hardship should be met by special treatment.</p></blockquote>
Then the Committee go on to mention the case of working-classes whose wages have 	<i>been</i> increased to a very great degree since August, 1914, and point out how fortunate they are as compared with the middle classes now whose income has not increased. Very well, we have to consider not only the poor tenants, not merely the working class tenant, but also the poor landlord. The hon. Baronet below me pleaded for the poor landlord. We have to consider the two cases, and how we can do justice. It is obvious, if we only give a mere 5 per cent to the poor landlord, he will not be able to do the repairs. Equally if you increase the rent of the poor tenant up to this 25 per cent. or 18 per cent. on the standard rate, you would be putting a burden on him that he may not be able to bear. I suggest a compromise. It may be that the Committee think it a very bad one, but I have an Amendment down on the Order Paper to Clause 16 to add the following new Sub-section—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) The County Court shall have power to refuse an order for possession or reduce rent at its discretion where the tenant can prove that his income has not increased since August, 1914, and there are reasonable grounds in the opinion of the Court for granting him protection and relief, including the absence of suitable alternative accommodation."</p></blockquote>
I admit that means mere litigation, and more work for the County Court Judge. I am speaking now of those whose rent is, say, £90 a year. That rent will be actually increased if this Bill becomes law from £90 to, say, £120, but my Amendment will at any rate give the man a chance of going to the Court and saying: "My income now is less than it was in 1914, I cannot afford to pay, and I claim the protection of the Court. You might equally, in certain of these Clauses, do something to protect the poor landlord. However, I do suggest this: that the poor tenant I have mentioned has a real claim for our consideration. That claim is recognised by the Salisbury Committee. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
ought to give him some relief under this Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the remarks of the hon. and gallant Member who has just sat down, I cannot conceive how the County Court Judge can fairly hold the scales, because he has to have it in evidence that practically all these landlords' incomes are less than before the war.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Major NEWMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have budgets from poor tenants!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have letters in my hand from ladies If you do not increase this Amendment adequately, and give some time to deal with it, and to accumulate a fund to deal with these repairs, you cannot get anything done. Here in my hand is the case of people who had to raise a mortgage during the War in order to carry on at all. You have to hold the scales fairly between the parties concerned. I do not think anybody is here—and I am not here—either in the interests of the landlord or the tenant. We want something which is fair and equitable, and something which is going to work. It is of no use giving doles out as in the past. Of the housing scheme the right hon. Gentleman has had experience. If he had only gone the whole way in his housing schemes, I can say he would have had a great many more houses than he has now. If you do not give an adequate sum for repairs the result will be you will not get your repairs; and you really want to help the housing schemes. The Mover of this Amendment gave us figures from Glasgow. I cannot understand a public body trying to hoodwink the public like they are doing by these figures. The percentages are wrong. The "rent allowed under the new Bill" is not rent. It is made up almost entirely with the abnormal and enormous increases in the rates, and nothing else. They have actually tried to prove too much. For a big body to set out and try to hoodwink the people is bad. They do not say a single word in this return of what were the landlords' rates in 1914—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must remind the hon. Member that we are discussing repairs, and not rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has to do with the increase of 25 per cent., if I may respectfully say so. The paper they have produced here is to suggest the very Amendment—not the Amendment the hon. Gentleman has moved, but something of that nature. The hon. Member for Stoke Newington is in error. He knows the provisions both in regard to the landlord and the tenant. He must realise that there are some very great hardships. These are not what have been sent to him only, for hon. Members have bombarded me why I do not know, but I have a great number of letters pointing out how it would be impossible for these people to do these repairs unless they get this relief, and unless they have some considerable time allowed. There is a grave objection to going to the County Court. If you put the percentage at 50 per cent. and not at 25, it would not cover all the repairs in many cases. What do you find? Wages are three times higher, and there is a demand from people in the building trade to increase their wages in October next by another 8d. an hour. Where is it going to end? The whole thing is labour—labour from start to finish. I am surprised that when it was a question of raising the rates on the Metropolitan Railway, and labour agreed reasonably with raising the fares, and said that if the men wanted more wages they must increase the amount to the company, that now they come here and say, Do not increase the amounts, increase the men's wages as much as you possibly can, but provide nothing for these wages to be paid. It is illogical altogether. We shall back up the right hon. Gentleman in this case. I quite agree he is going to get some odium. But he is likely to get his work done, which he would not do if there was an unreasonable amount put on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite satisfied, after listening to the discussion and reading the Report of the Salisbury Commission, that the proposal of the hon. Member for Central Edinburgh (Mr. W. Graham) is really indefensible. I am quite sure the amount he proposes will not have the effect desired. It stands to reason that you are legislating here for a-type of owner who has probably got to
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
borrow money in order to get repairs effected. You are not dealing so much with the landlord who is in a position to deal with the repairs. The repairs which have not been done hitherto are largely repairs to small property, or property in the hands of trustees, or some sort of public body. The increase to be allowed has to bear some practical relation to the increased cost of making those repairs. Five per cent. bears no relation at all, in fact, to the increased cost of making repairs. On the other side, I must say that I am impressed by one argument of the hon. Gentleman, to the effect that the 25 per cent. does not stand alone, and that it is part of a cumulative set of increases. I should like to see something done in this Bill to prevent these cumulative increases all taking place simultaneously. That is the weak point in the Bill, whether it applies to the working classes or to the middle-class proteges of the hon. and gallant Member (Colonel Newman). Everybody knows that where a man is carrying on his weekly, monthly, or quarterly financial life on a small margin, violent changes, disturbances, and increases are the things that really create the hardship. I am wondering whether the right hon. Gentleman in charge of the Bill could not do something to prevent Pelion being piled upon Ossa, and to say that under no circumstances shall, during the first year, the total increase exceed such and such per cent.—that is the total increase for the purposes of this Act. I meant to take the Glasgow figures, but I am not in a position to criticise those figures and to know whether they are right or wrong, or what is included and what is not included. I see, however, there is a figure at the end of 60 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the sort of thing that is frightening tenants up and down the country. I would like to know whether that can be cleared up and whether the increase that is going to be allowed for rates, plus the 15 per cent., plus the increase for repairs can all fall at a given date together on a particular tenant. If that is so it is going to cause a great deal of hardship in individual cases, and if it could be arranged so that a cumulative result shall not be experienced it would be a good thing. On the specific question of repairs if it were 25 per cent. alone that does not seem to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
unreasonable, but when you take the 25 per cent. plus the others it does seem to me that you have got to consider the position rather carefully and put in limiting words so that he shall not get 60 per cent. all coming on at once.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The SECRETARY for SCOTLAND (Mr. Munro)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This interesting and important Amendment affects Scotland as well as England, and perhaps the Committee will allow me to say a word or two before reaching a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It includes England as well as Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MUNRO</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: England has been fully heard. I am not going to be drawn into the Glasgow controversy, I am not familiar with those figures. They seem to be exciting a certain amount of controversy. I propose to deal with the Amendment and not with the Glasgow balance sheet. The Salisbury Committee went into this matter very carefully and exhaustively. Their recommendation was that 25 per cent. of the net pre-war rental was a proper figure to add for all repairs that fell to be made by the landlord. If we face facts we can justify the recommendation of the Salisbury Committee. I do not profess to be an expert in this matter, but I am advised that if you impose this 25 per cent. the first year, you will get executed the repairs which you desire, and the Committee will remember that the first year is the important year. Owing to the want of repairs during the war houses are now in a state of gross disrepair, and are deteriorating rapidly. The longer you delay the repairs the more difficult and more costly will they be. Accordingly it is important that they should be done during the first year. Something has been said about the landlords not having executed repairs during the War. I hold no brief for landlords, but in many cases of which I am personally aware that was due to necessity rather than choice. Moreover, landlords like other people during the War, through the increased income tax and increased cost of living, may not have been able, even though they desired, to execute necessary repairs. If you will get the repairs executed by giving 25 per cent. increase, they will be done probably the first year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
What is the position when you come to consider 5 per cent.? Here again, speaking under advice, I am told that you will not get the repairs. It will not pay for the paint, apart from all other commodities you require for repairing houses. The result is to condemn the tenants for whom my hon. Friend speaks, always with eloquence and force, to remain in insanitary and defective dwellings. From the point of view of the tenants this is a most undesirable prospect. Then reference has been made to the check that if there are no repairs there would be no increase. Something has been said about the timidity of the tenant in going to the County Court to meet his landlord. I agree that there is something to be said from that point of view. Many tenants would not desire to go to the County Court to quarrel with their landlords, and the Government are quite prepared to accept the Amendment of the hon. Member for Wood Green (Mr. G. Locker-Lampson), after the word "tenant" to insert the words "or the sanitary authority" The tenant will not need to go to the Court. The sanitary authority will do so. On the question of the poor tenant, the Government propose to consider more minutely whether anything can be done to meet the wishes of my hon. Friend (Mr. Ormsby-Gore), which were expressed also by the Salisbury Committee. I hope that the Committee may see its way to reach a decision on this very important question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HALLAS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has. already decided upon an increase of 15 per cent. to provide for increase in mortgage interest and devaluation of money. Now we are dealing with the question of what will be a reasonable allowance for repairs. Our proposal is that we shall allow 15 per cent. increase for repairs in portions of 5 per cent. spread over three years. We are told by one hon. Member after the other that unless something more adequate from the landlord's point of view is done, no repairs will be executed. I want to suggest that repairs are due now with respect to rents already paid. Landlords have no right to expect increases of rents in the future for repairs that require to be executed now. They have been saving, for five years and in some cases ten years and in others even fifteen years, portions of their rent intended as payment for repairs that they have not executed, and now it is sug-

	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
gested that the duty of executing repairs, which should be performed by the owners, shall not be performed unless an increase of rent is permitted forthwith that will provide the money necessary to finance those undertakings. I could take Members of this Committee to streets of houses where the ceilings have not been whitened and. the walls have not been papered for fifteen years, where the paper is hanging in strips on the wall, where the beams in the bedroom are dripping with water and where the floors are uneven and rugged. Is. it suggested that owners of property such as this are not to be compelled to repair that property unless they receive an increase of rent that shall enable them to do it? I suggest that a man who owns and lets a diseased house ought to be dealt with as seriously as a man who owns and sells diseased meat. I protest against all this talk about the (Owner not doing this work unless he gets certain consideration. He should be made to do it. It is in no sense of the word the fault of the tenant that the houses are in this condition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HASLAM</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where is it that the neglect of the sanitary authority has allowed this to take place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point the hon. Member is making is dealt with in the existing Housing Acts and his statement means that the local authority in that area has neglected its duty. We empowered them, in the Housing Act of last year, if necessary to do the repairs themselves and to charge the landlord. They ought to carry out the law. The hon. Member's point does not arise here at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HALLAS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all respect to this Committee, the same argument is used by the owners as is being used by the Committee now: "we cannot afford it" I object to that argument being permitted to cover such offences. I am referring particularly to Birmingham. There and in many other towns houses are inhabited when in the condition I have described, houses which, before the war, were condemned by the sanitary authorities, but because of the acute shortage of houses, have been allowed to remain inhabited. There is a great deal of such property in
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
the country. With respect to the graded advance, as compared with putting on the advance forthwith, I wonder whether the Committee have considered the psychological effect of imposing a 40 per cent. advance right away. The advantage of a 5 per cent. advance, indeed the advantage of keeping the total advance to 30 per cent. as compared with 40 per cent. will surely be manifested in the goodwill of the people as a whole in their contented acceptance of the advance imposed, and in the promotion of peace throughout the country as compared with a very great deal of unrest and trouble, and undoubted rent strikes, that will occur if the proposals of the Bill are carried out. It does not seem to be recognised that what is going to happen as the result of this Bill, having regard to the increases that are taking place in rates throughout the country, is that the average tenant will soon be paying to his landlord nearly double what he paid him before the war.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HALLAS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was dealing with one or two points mentioned by hon. Members. Perhaps you will permit me to say, in regard to the effect upon wages, that this Bill will be followed by all-round applications for increases in wages to meet this increased cost in rent, and there will be all the consequent trouble and upheaval. I hope the Committee will very carefully consider this question, and for psychological and other reasons will make it as easy as possible for the tenant to pay the increased rent by graduating it, and will not forget the very important fact that repairs are already due for rent paid over a long series of years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"In the absence of any agreement to the contrary, the repairs under this Act are those normal to the class of property, internal and external, structural and decorative, in addition to those necessary under the various Acts of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
The difficulty in this particular Clause is that we really do not know what the word "repairs" means. So far as I know, there is no definition of "repairs" As I mentioned just now, in the 1909 Act it means keeping houses reasonably fit for human habitation, and under the 1919 Act
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
the same kind of explanation was given. Of course, in regard to very poor property, keeping it reasonably fit for human habitation might be quite sufficient, but we are dealing now with questions that will give a basis for the increase of rent, and, in the case of better property, I do not think myself that a landlord ought, perhaps, to be able to increase the rent unless he does repairs normal for the class of property which will come under this Bill. In the case of very poor property, so long as he keeps it watertight, and in a state reasonably fit for human habitation, I quite agree he ought to have an increase of rent; but in the case of a better class of property, inhabited by professional people referred to by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Finchley (Colonel Newman), I think he ought to do really more than keep it in a state fit for human habitation. For instance, a landlord might have one house in a street. The whole of the rest of the houses might be painted, and he might allow the paint on his house absolutely to peal off, and the tenant might be forced, in self-defence, to paint the house himself. I do not know that I have given a very good illustration, but I hope the Committee see my point of view. As there is no definition in any Act of Parliament as far as I know—I am under correction—I think the repairs under this Bill ought to be repairs normal to the class of property dealt with under it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MUNRO</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope my hon. Friend will not press this Amendment. It is quite true, I think, as he has said, that there is no definition of repairs in any Act of Parliament, and I think the reason is because it has always been regarded as exceedingly dangerous to import a rigid definition in any Act of Parliament—a definition which, quite unwittingly, so far as its author is concerned, might rule out a number of cases and create hardship. I would submit that where you are con

	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
sidering a question of reasonable repairs, the safest thing is to leave that for the determination of the Court in each case My hon. Friend has spoken about "normal" What is normal in one set of circumstances would be entirely abnormal in another set of circumstances, and my point is that the Court, dealing with each case that comes before it in the circumstances disclosed before the Court, should determine what is reasonable in each case. I think it is far safer to leave the Court to decide for itself in each case, rather than impose a hard and fast definition, which might result in many hard cases which my hon. Friend would desire to protect. As my right hon. Friend reminds me, it is not as if you were imposing upon the Court a new strange or difficult duty. The Courts have been dealing with cases of this sort for more years than I or any other Member of the Committee can remember, and to import, at this time of the day, a definition of the extremely elastic word "repairs" in an Act of Parliament would be to create an exceedingly bad and dangerous precedent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HAYWARD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman, the Minister, in dealing with one or two previous Amendments, said frankly the object of this Bill was to get the repairs, done. The payment of sufficient rent is one of the inducements to get repairs done, but this Clause, I understand, is intended for the same purpose, and is intended to confer a double assurance to the tenant that these repairs shall be done. My hon. Friend who moved the Amendment has raised a very important point, and I do not think the matter is at all met by the reply of the right hon. Gentleman. I think that this Clause as it stands gives very little indication, or very little guidance certainly, to, the Committee as to what is the, nature of repairs which can be insisted upon under the Act. The right hon. Gentleman said, which might be perfectly true, that what "reasonable repairs" or "fit for human habitation" means has not been decided by any Act of Parliament. That may be so, but I think very likely it has been decided by case law, and I think, probably, somebody on behalf of the Government will tell the Committer, so far as he can, exactly what
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
obligation, in his judgment, would lie upon the landlord under the terms used in this Section. One is that the property shall be fit for human habitation. I believe it has been settled again and again what that means, and I believe it means very little indeed. I believe, legally, it means little more than that you should keep up the walls, keep a ceiling overhead, and keep the rain out, and no more than that. It is not as if the words of the Clause meant "fit for human habitation and otherwise in a reasonable state of repair," but it is "or," so that, if the property is kept in a state fit for human habitation, the landlord has complied with the obligation, and there is no more to do. If that is correct, there need be no repairs whatever executed under this Act, and the Clause would become a dead letter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOR DEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole thing hinges on the word "normal," and you may read that word "normal" as "reasonable" You cannot possibly define it. If you had twenty surveyors, they would have different views with regard to a house being in normal repair, and, therefore, you are up against the same proposition you would be if it did not exist, and I think to try to define it is practically useless, because it does not mean anything. The word "normal" has no real meaning in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir C. WARNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. Friend has made a mistake about the word "or" If "and" were inserted, it would mean that you could not get off paying the extra rent unless both things were done. I would appeal to the Government to see if they could not find some form of words which would make rather a higher standard of repairs not only for the better houses but all houses—whether words could not be inserted on Report necessitating rather more drastic repairs and cleanliness, because that it is the point—the whitening of ceilings, attention to drains, water supply, and such things—a little more stringent than at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A very common instance, at least in London, is this: A landlord, for the purpose of this Act, would be a person only liable for part of the repairs, and, as it now stands, I rather gather that a landlord, who is possibly a sub-lessee, only partially responsible for repairs, might get the full 25 per cent. out of the tenant in those cases where the tenant himself is under express liability
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
for repairs. It is a very common case. Therefore, I think the Government ought to define "repairs," and bear in mind paragraph (	<i>d</i>) whilst doing it. I was rather interested in hearing the Secretary for Scotland say that the Courts have been dealing with this problem for many years, and have found no difficulty in interpreting the meaning of repairs. That may be the condition of affairs in Scotland, but not in England, because half of us live under constant quarrels as to what repairs may mean. It is on purely altruistic grounds that I am suggesting to the Government that whilst they are busy they should give, if they can, a clear definition of repairs. Although I sympathise with the object of the hon. Member for Wood Green I think his definition would be rather worse than no definition at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Committee will be satisfied if I give an assurance on behalf of the Government to look into this matter between now and the Report Stage to see if any definition can be usefully inserted. I think, however, hon. Members who are here, and many of whom, I know, are used to the practise in the courts, will agree with me when I say that the last thing you want to do is to embark upon putting in definitions in matters of this sort. In my judgment—and I want to say this to the Committee quite respectfully—I think you might very well leave it to the County Court judge as a matter of fact, and not as a matter of law, as to whether repairs have been sufficiently and adequately done or not. Obviously, the Amendment which my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green has put down is open to very many objections, for you are raising different standards of repairs in regard to different houses. However, my right hon. Friend the Minister of Health instructs me to say that he will look into the matter, and see if any definition of repairs can be usefully inserted, and I have no doubt the Committee will be satisfied with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1), at the end, to add
	<br><blockquote><p>"(iii) Where the tenant is under an express liability for the whole of the repairs, no increase in rental under paragraph (	<i>c</i>) of the foregoing Sub-section shall be permissible."</p></blockquote>
In the discussion on paragraph (ii), the hon. Member for Woolwich (Sir K. Wood) said, in reply to a small Amendment I had down on the Paper, that it would be possible, where the obligation of the tenant and the obligation of the landlord were more or less the same, to meet the point I raised, namely, that some consideration should be given to the obligation of the tenant in regard to the increased cost of repairs which now has to be met. The object of this Amendment is to go a little further, and to say that, where the tenant is entirely responsible for repairs, he shall be given compensation for the increased cost, in the same way that the landlord is given compensa-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
tion under paragraph (	<i>d</i>). I quite realise, as the Amendment is drafted, that it may not be possible for the Government to accept it in that form; but I would ask them to consider the fact that, as the Bill stands at present, a tenant who has to undertake the entire obligation gets no compensation at all for the increased cost which he now has to pay for executing repairs. I would ask the Government, therefore, sympathetically, to consider the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. and gallant Friend recognises that in such a case as he has mentioned, it would not give the tenant any claim to prevent the owner of the house getting the assistance which paragraph (	<i>c</i>) affords him in connection with paying any increased interest on his mortgage. Paragraph (	<i>c</i>) relates to the increased interest on mortgages. My hon. and gallant Friend recognises that it would not meet that point at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am afraid I see grave difficulty in introducing anything of that kind in such a case.

Perhaps my hon. and gallant Friend will let me think it over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, at the end of Sub-section (1) to add the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"(iii) Where in any case all the increases allowed under this Section are operative at the same time, nothing in this Section shall permit of a greater cumulative increase than 35 per cent. of the net rent exclusive of any increase in rates."</p></blockquote>
The object of this Amendment is to try to meet the case which was represented before lunch by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Ormsby-Gore), where you get all the increases allowed under this Section operative at the same time. I know quite well it can be said that in many cases the Amendment would be unnecessary, but the point to be remembered is that the general public,
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
looking at this Bill, are not lawyers, and they look, not at the different little points of the Bill, but at the Bill as a whole. They follow very largely what is given to them in the Press, and the Press, in giving out a summary of this Bill, has, I note, on previous occasions, not given the effect of each Sub-section separately, but the cumulative effect of all the Sections They have described the Bill as permitting increases of 40 per cent. in rent, and the public look at that and say, "This Bill allows an increase of 40 per cent. in rent. What are we going to do?" The result is that you get demonstrations and people attempting to organise some opposition to the measure, and, although I feel that certain Subsections of this Section, particularly the Sub-section in regard to increases allowed for repairs, are entirely justified. I consider that we want to place some limit, particularly on the tenant occupying a house with a small rental. Although it is quite true to say that many people have had large increases of wages, it is also quite true to say that there are many people who are living in houses which are now included under this Bill, who have had no increase of wage or salary of any kind. They are living, to a very large extent, on the same income on which they lived before the War, and, if they are going to be suddenly faced with a large cumulative increase of rental, they will not be able to meet it. There is one other point which I would like to mention in this connection. My hon. Friend opposite, the Member for St. Pancras (Mr. Lorden), referred to a statement issued by the Glasgow Corporation. I happen to be the only Member who represents a Glasgow constituency on this Committee, and I would like to say that the statement which has been issued is perfectly correct, if it is properly understood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that we can discuss the correctness or incorrectness of a statement of the Glasgow Corporation. The members have been asked to confine themselves as strictly as they can to the terms of the various Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then I will leave that question alone. Apart from the increases allowed by these Sub-sections, I do not think full consideration has been given to the fact that, if you
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
are going to have increases of 30 or 40 per cent. in rental, it will result in a very considerable proportionate increase in the rates. I do not mean in the amount of the rates, but in the amount of the rates according to the increased rental, and it was with that object in view that this statement was issued. It does not affect English Members, but only Scottish Members. The fact remains that if you get an increase of 30 per cent. allowed in the rent, the rates payable subsequently will naturally be so much larger. I feel that this Amendment which we have drafted, and which is on a very moderate scale—it allows 35 per cent.—will go some way to meet the case which my hon. Friend has tried to represent. You will avoid getting the full 25 per cent., the 15 per cent., and the small increase allowed under Sub-section (	<i>a</i>) placed on all at once, quite regardless of the question of the increase of rates. It is only right that the question of increase of rates should be excluded from this Amendment, because every householder is a ratepayer, and if he, or the general body of householders, consider that the rates in a particular locality are too high and are badly administered, they have their own remedy as ratepayers at the next municipal election. It would be a great mistake to pick out rates and in any way try to standardise them in a Bill of this kind. Therefore we have tried to frame this so as to exclude the question of the increase in rates altogether, and simply make it apply to the other three paragraphs (	<i>d</i>), (	<i>a</i>), and (	<i>c</i>). I hope that the Government will consider this point favourably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think my hon. and gallant Friend's aim is altogether quite accurately expressed in this Amendment. I take it that what they are aiming at is that, notwithstanding the provisions in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>d</i>), all these things added together in respect of increases in rent shall not, at all events in the first year, amount to more than so much. This Amendment does not say that. It says that the cumulative increase shall not be more than 35 per cent. That is without limit of time, either in extent or in its application. That is not quite what my hon. Friend opposite (Mr. Ormsby-Gore), anyhow, meant when he spoke this morning. I take it that this Amendment is intended, without interfering with the increases of rent which have been provided under
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>d</i>) particularly, to secure that in any one year their cumulative effect shall not be more than so much, and the balance will have to be made up in the next year. There is a good deal to say for that proposal. It is really a question as to the way in which the increases should become incident upon the tenant. That is really the point in question, and perhaps my hon. Friends will allow me to explore that between now and the Report stage, or, if necessary, to refer to it later on in Committee if any appropriate opportunity occurs. I am quite sure that this Amendment as it stands would not do at all. I see the general purpose of it, which is. to say, "Notwithstanding all these increases, which we accept, only a certain proportion is to come in the first year" The balance may come in the second year. Perhaps my hon. Friends will allow me to think it over, and either suggest another Clause, if I can frame one, or bring up something on the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to thank the right hon Gentleman for his frank consideration. He has certainly got the point of the Amendment, as far as I am concerned. It is the cumulative effect of putting all these increases on the first year which is the great hardship. There is one point which we have not cleared up between us. I do not suggest that in the second year the landlord should have the right to collect, as it were, the full increase that accrued during the first year. I hope that is quite clear. I am not at all sure that 35 per cent. is not quite high enough, and I should like it left an open question, whether it should not be 30 per cent. the first year and the full 40 per cent. the second year, or whatever it is; I believe it amounts to 42½ per cent. I am very thankful the right hon. Gentleman will consider this point. If he could bring it in the Committee stage of the Bill it would be far more advantageous than leaving it to the Report stage. I must apologise for the drafting of this Amendment. My hon. Friend and I only thought of it this morning during the discussion, and I quite see that, as it has been handed in, it is not quite suitable to the object that we have in view. I do hope the right hon. Gentleman and the Government will consider the matter further, because I am sure it would ease the passage of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am afraid I made a statement on the Second Reading of the Bill which the text of the Bill did not warrant. I presented my apologies to the House then, and I renew them to the Committee. This Amendment is in order to bring the text of the Bill into accord with what I said. The proposal—I can quite see its contentious features—is that the increase in rent shall be allowed for three months before you necessarily require the County Court or take other proceedings to suspend or reduce that increase of rent on account of the repairs not having been executed. I was advised, and I am quite sure it is true in a large number of cases, that there are vast numbers of these houses held by people who have a very small amount of credit at their disposal, who are not very familiar with methods of borrowing and so on, and who have just two or three cottages each. They would want a little time to turn round before they could raise the money to pay for the necessary repairs. Therefore I propose that they should have three months in which to turn round and to have further increased receipts coming it. Then, if their obligations are not carried out, provisions are suggested in an Amendment to be proposed—and which is to be accepted—by my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green (Mr. G. Locker-Lampson) whereby that increase of rent may be suspended in the event of repairs not being executed. I feel with regard to a lot of these people that it would not be fair, or in the interests of getting repairs done, to say, "You shall not receive a penny increase until you have spent all the money in carrying out repairs," because they cannot find the money to do
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
so in the first instance. Therefore I think that three months' grace is perhaps a fair way of meeting this difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might I just appeal to the Minister to consider whether the three months cannot be increased? I have an Amendment which increases it to eighteen months. It seems to me that three months do not give people time enough to be able to accumulate anything at all, if it be a small house. If it were made six months, very probably I could see my way to withdraw my Amendment. It would be much more likely that repairs would be done. What is six months on a house of £10, or £20, or even £30 a year with regard to the repairs which are necessary, even if they are only ordinary repairs? 	<i></i>It does seem to me, as the right hon. Gentleman has already mentioned, that they ought to be given some time in which to turn round. Three months does seem an extremely short period, and I would ask the Minister if he could not see his way to increase it to six or, at a pinch, to nine months. We do want this thing to become operative. Many of these people will have to pay their money down before they can get the work done. I have received several letters from persons pointing out that they cannot possibly find money for repairs. Therefore I think we are warranted in dealing with these people in a reasonable sort of way, and I ask the Minister to see if he cannot meet the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel NEWMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to support what my hon. Friend opposite has said. It is impossible for an owner of small house property to get his repairs done within three months. Six months would be more reasonable, or it might meet the case if something were put in the Bill giving the landlord the right of appeal to the County Court for protection, and the County Court to determine whether he had or had not had a fair chance, and to give him further time, if necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am afraid this Amendment possibly is more controversial, but I do feel that the County Court is one of the last bodies before which I should like to see the tenant have to go. I am very much averse, and I am sure a great many Members of the Committee are averse, from the tenants having to go before any legal body. Everybody is most averse from taking legal proceedings, and it has to be remembered that County Courts sit occasionally once a fortnight, but usually once a month, and they may be sitting at the county town fifteen or twenty miles from where the premises are situated. To my mind, it will be a most difficult problem for the Court to deal with. It has a great deal of work already to do, and it will be flooded with applications from all these tenants. Personally, I should have thought that the Local Assessment Committee would have been a far better body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

They are always hearing claims, and they are always dealing with this kind of work. I am simply throwing this out as a proposal. I do not rule out the County Court. I simply say that in the first instance it seems to me better that the tenant should be able to apply to the Local Assessment Committee—or the landlord for that matter—and, if they do not get satisfaction, then they can apply to the County Court. I feel that this particular body is really not the proper body to deal with the vast number of claims which will come before it; it will not have time to look into them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that the Government cannot see their way to accept this Amendment. Most members of the Committee will agree that the County Court Judges have had considerable experience already in matters of this kind, and have conducted them very satisfactorily, as far as one can be satisfied on a matter of this sort. They are trained in this sort of work, and to set up a sort of foreign body such as that
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>
suggested in the Amendment, which sits in secret as I understand it, and which does not, I believe, of necessity have anyone of legal training or knowledge upon it, in order to deal with a matter of this kind, privately and without publicity, the public or the Press not being present, would be a most undesirable thing. Having regard to all the facts and to the previous experience which the County Courts have had, I consider it is far better to continue with the County Courts.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move this Amendment in order to emphasise a principle which appears to me to be laid down in this Sub-section. That principle was laid down by Mr. Joseph Chamberlain in his Radical days, when he asked, "What ransom shall property pay?" That is an hyperbolical way of saying that property has its duties as well as its rights, and it appears to me that we have now, by the provisions laid down in paragraph (	<i>d</i>) of this Clause, given the landlord no. excuse whatever for not carrying out the necessary repairs to any house which he happens to own. I am afraid that in this paragraph which we are at present discussing there is not enough guarantee that the landlord will spend the 25 per cent. increase which he gets upon repairs. The penalty which is imposed by this Sub-section upon the landlord for not carrying out the duty of repairs is, in my opinion, insufficient, because we all agree this morning that the essential thing was to get repairs done. Therefore, if we give the landlord, as we have done, the money with which to do these repairs, we should have power to punish him, and to punish him severely, if he does not carry them out. Therefore some additional penalty ought to be imposed upon a landlord who does not carry out his duties of doing repairs. I would point out that he will receive the money before he is called upon to execute the repairs, because we have just given him three months' grace before any appeal can be lodged. Therefore I do submit to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>211</span>
Committee in all sincerity that it is not unreasonable to demand that, having received the money to do a specific job, he should do that job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir C. WARNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I often suggested, some 20 years ago, that a house which was uninhabitable should not be allowed to pay rent, but in this particular case we have houses that are heavily mortgaged, and the effect in some cases would be to hand over the house from the present owner to the mortgagee. Therefore, we cannot give the whole rent, but I think it would be very fair to give all the uncharged rent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise for the purpose of supporting the Amendment, because, as the Clause now stands, it is perfectly plain that it will often pay the landlord not to carry out repairs, because. he will still get the 25 per cent. increase in rent. The Clause enables him to leave it to the unfortunate tenant to take such remedy as he can under this Sub-section. I should like to ask the Government to consider the question of re-casting this Clause altogether. To my mind, it is most unsuitable. Under the machinery which has been set up, there are two ways of dealing with a landlord who does not do his duty. Either the tenant goes to the County Court and finds himself at daggers drawn with his landlord, especially in the case of property of a high rental value, in which case the landlord is responsible for the structural repairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the question before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was putting this forward in order to emphasise the point that some penalty is necessary. The sanitary inspector in a borough where the Public Health Act is not in force will do nothing, and the landlord will get off free. A landlord getting this increase of rent must either do his duty or be penalised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TREVELYAN THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one further point. During the War repairs have not been carried out. The landlord has been getting full rent with no empties, and, therefore, has been getting a bigger ratio of income than in pre-War times, while the property has had no call upon it. Under normal conditions, the local authority would, in a great many
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
cases, issue a Closing Order on its own initiative in respect of a great deal of property not fit for human habitation. That would play into the hands of the landlords. He would be able to get vacant possession, the one valuable thing that he wants. Therefore it would pay the landlord not to do repairs and to force the hand of the local authority to pass a Closing Order, which would give him vacant possession. We ought to provide for the waiving of the issue of Closing Orders; otherwise we shall play into the hands of the owner who is unscrupulous. Not only should the landlord have no opportunity of securing vacant possession, but, until the repairs are carried out, he should receive no rent, and additional pressure should be placed upon him to carry out repairs forthwith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Sir Gordon Hewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the temporary absence of my right hon. Friend who is in charge of this Bill, it appears to me that there is very much to be said in support of this Amendment and the speeches which have been made in support of it. At first blush, it does seem odd that the Sub-section should contemplate that, in the case of a house not reasonably fit for human habitation or otherwise not in a reasonable state of repair, a portion of the rent might, upon these grounds, be refused, whereas certain other portions of the rent might, in spite of these grounds, be payable. It looks anomalous, and the anomaly is not entirely met by the circumstance, with which Members of the Committee are familiar, that the local authority under the Housing Acts can carry out repairs where a landlord fails to carry them out, and debit the landlord with the cost. On the other hand, I am not able to say that the words suggested in the Amendment can be adopted. I would suggest that the Amendment should be for the time being withdrawn, and that we should sympathetically consider the matter between the present time and the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In this paragraph, because the repairs are not carried out, you take away what you have previously given in the preceding Amendment. If you are going to do that, you will get no houses at all. Nobody will attempt to build in circumstances under which you can take the house entirely away and deduct money also in the case of mortgage. I hope something will be done with regard to this Section. I thought that we wanted to get houses; it now seems that it is not houses and repairs that we want, but that we wish to penalise somebody, and in this case it is the man who has property and cannot repair it. There are people in dire distress living on property and getting nothing from it. The hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Mr. T. Thomson) said that they have had a good time. With all the incubuses that have been put upon property, I really think that something must be done in order to get people to build and own property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move this in order to ascertain what is the Government's view of the exact meaning of these words. I am not going to press the Amendment to a Division, but I do urge the Government not to use the words "not reasonably fit for human habitation". I am very strongly under the impression that these words mean very little, if anything at all. Under an
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
Amendment which I believe has been accepted, the sanitary authority might be called upon to say whether the property was fit for human habitation, and, if they decided that it was not, they would be condemning themselves, because it would not be right for the property to be inhabited at all. I do urge the Government to use some stronger words than are provided at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir G. HEWART</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure that I follow the observations of my hon. Friend. I gather that his object is to make the provisions of this Clause not less, but more stringent. If the Amendment were to be adopted, it would follow that, in order to obtain relief under the Sub-section, the applicant would have to show two things, (	<i>a</i>) that the house was not reasonably fit for human habitation, and also (	<i>b</i>) that otherwise it was not in a reasonable state of repair. Thus, by making the two conditions cumulative, the Section would be not more, but less stringent. It is enough as it stands now. As it is, the unfortunate tenant will only be required to satisfy the court of one state of things or the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This appears to be a small point, but my hon. Friend (Mr. A. Williams) on whose behalf I am moving the Amendment tells me that it is an important one. Houses in mining districts have been irretrievably damaged by subsidence, and in such cases the landlord, obviously, could not put them in a state of repair on the comparatively small sum that he could obtain. He could not rebuild and he could not get any relief at all under this Act, because the houses would not be reasonably fit for habitation. My hon. Friend has put down the Amendment in order to get from the Government some indication of their intentions. I understand that hon. Members of the Labour party did bring in a Bill with regard to subsidence and compensation. The Government did not adopt it, or it was defeated, but the Government undertook later to introduce legislation to deal with the subject. My hon. Friend has put down this Amendment to learn from the Government their intentions in dealing with this hardship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel NEWMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (2), to leave out the words "or otherwise" ["certificate of the sanitary authority or otherwise that any"].
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this particular Clause the County Court Judge will have a lot of difficulty He will have to decide if a house is, or is not in a reasonable state of repair. There will be many actions on this subject, and therefore we ought to make his work as easy as we can. What does "or otherwise" mean? If the certificate of the sanitary authority is not enough, what is enough? And if it is not enough why have the certificate of the sanitary authority at all? The words are very misleading and confusing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir G. HEWART</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that the case against this Amendment was reasonably clear. The question is upon what sort of material is the Court to be satisfied that such a ground as which that has been referred to is established. The Bill makes particular mention of the production of a certificate of the sanitary authority, not, as is suggested, because the Bill contemplates that though the sanitary authority had certified the affirmative the Court might fail to be satisfied and ask for something more. No doubt if the sanitary authority did so certify the Court would be very likely be satisfied. The words "or otherwise" are not inserted so as to add something to the certificate of the sanitary authority where it is granted, but obviously, I should have thought, to provide for the case where for some reason or other the certificate of the sanitary authority has been refused If the tenant can produce a certificate from the sanitary authority, one would imagine that the County Court Judge would find all plain sailing. But it might be that although for some reason the sanitary authority has not given a
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
certificate, there is other evidence upon which the Court ought to be satisfied, and might be asked, properly, to be satisfied that the ground referred to is established. These words diminish the burden on the tenant and the omission would increase it, and I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (2), after the word "agreement" ["default or breach of express agreement shall"] to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall serve notice on the owner requiring him to execute the necessary repairs within such time as may be specified in the notice, and"</p></blockquote>
The object of the Amendment is to do what the Committee agrees should be done to improve the condition of the property and make sure that the repairs are made. The Clause at present merely suspends the increase of rent until the repairs are done. This Amendment seeks to go further, and to give the Court power to order the owner to execute the repairs forthwith. I am aware that local authorities have at present powers, but they are not always willing to exercise all the powers which they possess with regard to compelling owners to improve their property. This Amendment adopts the Government's own words. It is taken from Clause 4 of the Agriculture Bill, which provides that the Court may make an Order on the owner with regard to lands, and I hope, therefore, that the Government will take a favourable view of it. The effect of this Amendment, and of an Amendment lower down, is that if the owner does not execute the repairs then the Court may give the tenant power to do the repairs and deduct the cost from the rent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir G. HEWART</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One may say of this Amendment what was said of the fairy in the story, "I am not what I am, but what I shall be" This Amendment standing by itself would be comparatively nugatory. But it is intended to lead up to the Amendment which my hon. Friend has referred, which I look at in the light of a consequential Amendment. Looking at it in this way it is unnecessary. It would put upon the county court the burden of making this notice, and further, in the only event in which this provision burden of making this notice, and, further, Order. It is quite sufficient that the Court should do that which the Bill at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0107">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>217</span>
present provides, that it shall do, namely, shall order that the increase be suspended until the Court is satisfied on the report of the sanitary authority, or otherwise, that the necessary repairs have been executed. For what is ancillary to that? There is, I should have thought, sufficient power already existing in the local authorities under the Housing Acts. The judicial body, the Court, which is to be satisfied upon this matter, will, I submit, have discharged its task when it makes the Order suspending the rent until, upon satisfactory evidence, it is satisfied that the repairs have been done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The desire is that it should be possible to transfer the rates to a tenant. At present there is considerable trouble with the continual rise in the rates, and there is a feeling among a great number of people that, in the interests of property and in the interests of tenants themselves, the tenants should pay the rates, and that the transfer of rates should not be deemed to contravene this Section.

Under various parts of this Clause various claims might arise which would be open to dispute, and we must provide some means of settling the dispute in a fair way.

The object of this Amendment is to safeguard the position of people who may, because of the difficult conditions of recent times, have entered into, or been compelled to enter into, agreements very much against their interests.

The object of this Amendment is to continue the provision in the present Acts with respect to the notice to the tenant of increases in rates, so that there shall be four weeks' notice of any increase of rates that has to be paid by the tenant instead of one week's notice as is set forth in this Clause. I think it would be fair for a tenant to have this notice for many
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
reasons. He would be able to inquire into the increase of rates that he was expected to pay, and satisfy himself that everything was fair and above-board. We have heard of things being done which are quite other than fair and above-board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K.

Friend. The Committee in their Report pointed out that the effect of the existing law was to prevent the landlord from recovering an increase on account of rates in respect of the four weeks preceding the termination of the notice. The Bill reduces the four weeks to one, and it seems necessary in order to avoid many cases of real injustice. I hope my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one point I want to raise with regard to this question. I do see a considerable difficulty here—it has already happened—with regard to one clear week's notice. It ought to be "after the rate is made" I know of several London boroughs whose rate has been made four or five weeks after it comes into force. The rate is not made until the 28th of April in some cases, and it is applicable as from the 1st of April. A local authority might make their rate three months after the date, with the result that there would be three months' rates and One week in which the landlord would have to give notice. Some amendment is, therefore, wanted to meet the question of the date on which the rate is made, because it is not the intention, I take it, that the landlord should bear a considerable proportion of the increase of rates but that the tenant should bear the increase of rates. I can bring before the Committee the case of a rate in the district in which this House happens to be, that was not made until considerably after the day on which it became applicable. Although the rate may be made weeks afterwards, it is operative, I believe, not only from the date on which it is made, but it may include all the expenses that have gone on previously. Therefore if you are going to put one clear week upon the landlord after he has known that the rate has been increased, it may be that a month or two months will elapse before he is able to know what that rate will be.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that the general purpose of this Amendment is to avoid what I think the Committee would agree may easily be a procedure which is not fair, and which savours, shall I say without using an obnoxious term, of sharp practice, whereby a good many notices, I am informed, have been served on people in anticipation of the passing of this Act, and which might take effect before the Act authorised them to take effect. We do not want that. That is clearly what my hon. Friends have had in their minds, because they provide that this notice shall apply "subsequent to the commencement of this Act" I am sure the Committee will desire that we should keep the date of the commencement of this Act coming into operation as a clear date, and that the operations permissible under it should not be effective before that date. I think the better way of meeting the proposal would be if I were to insert after the word "a" ["served upon the
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
tenant a notice"] the word "valid," and then, at the end of the Sub-section, insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"A notice served before the passing of this Act of an intention to make any increase of rent which is permissible only by virtue of this Act shall not be deemed to be a valid notice for the purpose of this Section."</p></blockquote>
That would meet the case in a much better way. If my hon. Friend will withdraw the Amendment, I will move the insertion of those words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>Amendment made: In Sub-section (2), after the word "a" ["served upon the tenant a notice"], insert the word "valid"—[	<i>Dr. Addison.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Subsection (2), to leave out the words "a reference to the provision of this Act under which the increase is permitted" and to insert instead thereof the words "a statement of the amount of the proposed increase".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment is intended to convey—and I think it will meet the general desires of the Committee—that when notice of the amount of increase under the Act is given, it should contain exact particulars of such increase, so that the tenant may know exactly what he has to pay. This is a desirable Amendment, on which the Committee will not need any further explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel NEWMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (2), after paragraph (	<i>b</i>), to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>c</i>) Where the increase in on account of repairs or re-decorations, by a statement showing particulars of such repairs or re-decorations, and their cost".</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether the last Amendment which we have accepted covers my point or not, but what I want to do is perfectly obvious. I want, in addition to the particulars that have to be given in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>), that where the increase is on account of repairs or re-decorations, the landlord should have to give a statement showing particulars of such repairs or re-decorations, and their costs. I do not know whether that is covered or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not necessary; it is a fixed amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that the percentage is fixed. It is 25 per cent. on the amount incurred, and therefore the tenant does not need the particulars which are referred to in the other part of the Sub-section. I should have said 25 per cent. on the net rent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. GRAHAM</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (2), after paragraph (	<i>b</i>), to insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>c</i>) In any case where the tenant is entitled to apply to the County Court under Sub-section (2) of Section 2 of this Act, by a statement in simple terms of the provisions of that Sub-section, and also a statement of the particular sanitary authority to whom the application for a certificate should be made".</p></blockquote>
The object of this Amendment is simply to secure that there may be on the notices a very short printed statement of the meaning of Sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Bill, and also an indication of the name and address of the sanitary authority. It may be contended that this is perhaps asking too much of owners of house property, but against that there is the view that we have everything to gain by full and definite information on these points being available. I think two or three lines of print on the innumerable notices which are issued to tenants and which are kept ready for the purpose would meet this need, and probably lead to the avoidance of a good deal of friction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can well see that these notices should be sent out in proper form, and that the information available for the tenant should be as nearly in standard form as possible. I am anxious to meet the case as well as I can. We have discussed it, and we came to the conclusion that probably it would be better if I were to put down a prescribed form of notice in a schedule. I think that would be the simplest way. If my hon. Friend will withdraw the Amendment, I will put down to-morrow a schedule proposing a standard form of notice. I think that would meet the needs of the case much better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir C. WARNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a very small point, but it will have to be very carefully done—I mean giving the address of the sanitary authority in the Schedule—because there is always the danger that the tenant may think that it is an Order
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
from the sanitary authority, which is the last thing that we want him to think. On the other hand, he may think that it is an Order to go to the sanitary authority and ask whether it is right, and that is another thing that ought to be avoided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make one point with regard to the remarks of the hon. Member for Woolwich (Sir K. Wood). I presume that the giving of this notice would be a condition precedent to the landlord recovering an increase of rent. Therefore, if there should be a slip in complying with the conditions, it would invalidate the notice. I would suggest to the Minister of Health, where there is a 	<i>bona fide</i> slip which does not prejudice anybody, that there should be some power given for the Court to give relief, so that the landlord can get his increase of rent notwithstanding; otherwise it will become very technical, and many men will be defeated in obtaining their rights by an unimportant slip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that is perfectly fair. I should explain to the Committee that my advisers told me, when I agreed that we would submit an alternative form of notice in the Schedule, that on the Report stage some words would need to be inserted referring to that notice in the Schedule. It must be understood that I shall have to move those words on the Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Subsection (2), after paragraph (	<i>b</i>), to insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>c</i>) In any other case a statement of what the landlord alleges to be the standard rent and what the landlord alleges to be the net rent of the premises and the percentages of any proposed increases."</p></blockquote>
We felt, on looking into this, that, the increase being based upon the standard rent, a tenant was entitled to know what is the standard rent upon which the increase is based. Otherwise, they might not know on what basis they were paying their 30 per cent., or 25 per cent., or whatever it is. Therefore, we ought to provide that the tenant should be informed by the landlord what he alleges to be the standard rent, and what he alleges to be the net rent, and the percentages of the proposed increases, showing the tenant quite clearly on what basis the increased percentages are being charged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that the notice that is going to be included in the schedule would make provision for this, would it not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That would be a common notice. That could not apply to the infinite variety of cases which would arise. When a landlord claims 25 per cent. or something or other because of repairs, the tenant is entitled to know on what it is based. It must vary with each individual house. It may be 25 per cent. on 7s. 6d., or 7s., or 6s. 6d., or some other figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will print the 25 per cent. in the notice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will consider that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad you put the Amendment down, because it covers the point raised by the hon. and gallant Member for Finchley (Colonel Newman) in a former Amendment which was withdrawn, and which the hon. Member for Woolwich (Sir K. Wood) did not answer correctly. He said that it was not necessary, because it was 25 per cent. on the amount incurred. It is not that; it is 25 per cent. of the net rent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I corrected that statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope therefore that the Committee will accept this Amendment, because it is most necessary that the tenant should know what the increase is which it is proposed to charge in respect of decorations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>Further Amendment made: At the end of the Clause add the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"A notice served before the passing of this Act of an intention to make any increase of rent which is permissible only by virtue of this Act shall not be deemed to a valid notice for the purpose of this Section"—[	<i>Dr. Addison.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Question proposed, "That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to get some indication from the Minister as to how he will deal with the difficulty that has already arisen with regard to a rate not being made until some period subsequent to the period for which it covers the expenses. It is a very real difficulty. It very often occurs that the rate is not made
	<span class='label label-info column'>226</span>
until several weeks afterwards. I hope some means will be devised to meet this point sympathetically. If you insist upon a week's notice after the landlord has received notice or has received his demand note, which is the first intimation that he has that an increase has taken place, probably there may be a matter of five, six, or seven weeks that will elapse during which there will be no payment, and the payment, according to this, will not be recoverable. I want the Minister to deal with that if he possibly can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has omitted to look at Sub-section (5) of Clause 2, which I think answers his point. It is there provided that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the expression 'rates' includes water rents and charges and any increase in rates payable by the landlord shall be deemed to be payable by him until the rate is next demanded."</p></blockquote>
That is to say, as from the date when the rate is payable by him. It means that rates which are dealt with in this notice would be covered as from the dates at which the rate is payable by him. It is not payable by him until the rate is made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another attempt, about as hopeless as the previous one, to keep down what we regard as an exorbitant increase in rents. The Committee are aware that one-half per cent. increase in mortgage interest means 5 per cent. increase in rents. Having regard to that which has gone
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>227</span>
before, I am afraid that nothing can be said to the Committee by the Labour Members that will induce them to believe that they are acting unwisely and unjustly in seeking to impose an increase of 40 per cent. on the rents of property in this country. I confess that it does not seem to me to be of any use to do anything more than formally move the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member, in moving his Amendment, did not think that, in resisting his former proposal, we had been in any way desirous of charging more than was really necessary. I am sure that I am representing the views of every Member of the Committee in saying that that was not so. The fact is that the rate of interest has gone up. It is not a fact that people can get money on mortgage for building houses at one-half per cent. more than they could before. They are very lucky if they can get it at one per cent. more, and we are not going as far as the real facts warrant us in putting it at one per cent. It was not out of any lack of sympathy with those concerned that the Committee resisted the hon. Member's former proposal, and will now resist this; it is because we are bound to recognise the facts of the situation. I am quite sure that one-half per cent. would not be any good, and that is why we put in one per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Clause provides that no order shall be made for the recovery of possession of or ejectment from a dwelling to which this Act applies, except in certain contingencies. One of those Contingencies is that any rent lawfully due from the tenant has not been paid. It is desirable that there should be some time limit. I do not stand by the time limit specified—fourteen days; that is an arbitrary limit—but I should like the right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir C. WARNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that fourteen days would leave weekly tenants in a difficult position.

	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
I reminded the Committee that this Clause provides that no order shall be made for ejectment except upon certain contingencies. Another contingency is that an obligation of the tenancy has been broken. The Amendment that I have put down is not merely a drafting one, because, I understand, supposing the tenancy of a house to which this Act applies expires, it will not expire because the Act will keep it alive. At the same time, this Clause provides that if an obligation of a tenancy has been broken the tenant can be ejected. An obligation of a tenancy is to give up possession at the end of the tenancy. It is merely a matter of interpretation. It seems to me, supposing a tenancy did come to an end during the operation of the Act, or supposing a landlord gave notice and the tenancy expired in that way, that the Act then becomes inoperative. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will consider whether some such words as these are not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see the object of my hon. and gallant Friend. Of course this Act deliberately overrides a contract of the kind that he has mentioned by securing for the tenant continuity of tenure. It is a fair point to meet, and I would suggest that the best way of meeting it is to insert, after the word "Act" ["tenancy or under this Act"] the words "so far as the same is consistent with the provisions of this Act".

We should like to understand what is meant by "annoyance to adjoining occupiers". Some people are very easily annoyed, and it takes much more to annoy other people. My hon. Friend who put down the Amendment (Mr. Myers) wanted to prevent people being turned out simply because they chose to sing hymns on Sunday, or something of that

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is conscious of the same difficulty which I myself have encountered. It is very difficult to define "annoyance," and we shall not get over the difficulty if we insert the word "serious," because any annoyance is serious to the person to whom it is an annoyance.

We move this Amendment because Judges have had a great difficulty in interpreting the word "himself" It might be held that the landlord himself only needed one bedroom.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of alternative accommodation is a very difficult one, and gives rise to more heart-burnings than any other of the many contentious points. I have a case here of a man with a family and several children who writes to me as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"During 1919 I heard of some property being sold at a reasonable price by certain mortgagees, and, after much consideration and clearly seeing the poor prospect I had of hardly ever getting anything like suitable accommodation, I decided to buy one of the houses, although I had to borrow every penny in order to do it. The present tenants, a middle-aged couple with no children, have the house on a 3-years' agreement, which expires in June, 1921, which fact I, of course, fully understood at the time of purchase, but was perfectly willing to try and make shift until the period should expire and I could take possession."</p></blockquote>
This gentleman is obviously afraid that he will not get possession. Here we have a couple living in the house and he with his children are unable to get a place. What is true in this case is true of many others. In a case where a couple are living in a house, in which there are two or three rooms seldom occupied, and where a husband and wife and several children who require accommodation can show suitable accommodation for the childless couple, the Court ought to be empowered to make an Order to have the family without children removed into the other accommodation and allow the man with the family to take possession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I cannot think of any words which go farther to corner every conceivable case than the words "in all respects," and were we to endeavour to limit these words by putting in such words as "having regard to the number of questions" we should be detracting from the effect of the words in the Bill. We are advised that "in all respects" would cover the number of persons to be accommodated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel NEWMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1, 	<i>d</i>), to leave out the words "in all respects."

These words from another standpoint give rise to some difficulty. I had another letter from a gentleman and the difficulty with him was that he wanted to get into his house. He had to show reasonable Alternative accommodation to his tenant, and he proceeded to do so. The house was apparently one with the same number of rooms, and was absolutely suitable. In only one respect was it less suitable. The dining room floor was not quite the same size. The tenant had bought a new dining room carpet and was not going to sacrifice that. My friend wrote to say that the Court might take the view that a man must not sacrifice his dining room carpet. That is the case which might be covered by these words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the question as to whether a dwelling house is suitable in all respects involves in any way the question of a dining room carpet. It is better to keep the words in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir ARTHUR FELL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would "in all respects" cover the case of a house being a little further from a railway station, or some circumstance such as that? If so I do not see how an owner can ever get anyone out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These words as to alternative accommodation give rise to more difficulty than anything else in the Bill, but we have to get in pretty wide words, and leave discretion to the Court to interpret them. We give to the Court the full option of taking the whole Clause on its merits. You must have wide words of this kind in, and you must give the County Court power to interpret them reasonably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendmant, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has been very good to us this afternoon. We have made excellent progress. It is generally agreed that in our two sittings tomorrow we ought to finish. Clauses 2 and 3 were the big Clauses of the Bill. I think that we shall have two full Sessions, and that we might look forward fairly confidently to finishing to-morrow. If it meet the convenience of the Committee, I would suggest that we might adjourn at this point, on the understanding that we shall finish in two Sessions to-morrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel NEWMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to business premises, are you going to introduce an Amendment in Committee stage or on the Report stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I went out to have a conference with the Prime Minister and other Members of the Government on that very point this afternoon. The Government view is that the right time to deal with the matter is when we come to the new Clauses in Committee. That was the pledge which I gave, and the matter will come up to-morrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel ASHLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have an Amendment to move, a new paragraph (	<i>e</i>). I take it that that will be the first Amendment to-morrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first Amendment will be the Amendment standing in the name of the hon. Member for Smethwick (Mr. J. Davison)—in Sub-section (1), at the end to add the words
