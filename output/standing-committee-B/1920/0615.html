and, in any such case as aforesaid, the court considers it reasonable to make such an order or give such judgment.</p>
	<p>The existence of alternative accommodation shall not be a condition of an order or judgment on any of the grounds specified in paragraph (	<i>d</i>) of this subsection—
	<ol>
	<li>where the tenant was in the employment of the landlord or a former landlord, and the dwelling-house was let to him in consequence of that employment and he has ceased to be in that employment; or</li>
	<li>where the landlord gave up the occupation of the dwelling-house in consequence of his service in any of His Majesty's forces during the war; or</li>
	<li>where the landlord became the landlord before the thirteenth day of September nineteen hundred and seventeen, or, in the case of a dwelling-house to which this Act applies but the enactments repealed by this Act did not apply became the landlord before the twentieth day of May nineteen hundred and twenty, and in the opinion of the court greater hardship would be caused by refusing an order for possession than by granting it.</li></ol></p>

	<p>(2) At the time of the application for or the making or giving of any order or judgment for the recovery of possession of any such dwelling-house, or for the ejectment of a tenant therefrom, or in the case of any such order or judgment which has been made or given, whether before or after the passing of this Act, and not executed, at any subsequent time, the court may adjourn the application, or stay or suspend execution on any such order or judgment, or postpone the date of possession, for such period or periods as it thinks fit, and subject to such conditions (if any) in regard to payment by the tenant of arrears of rent, rent, or mesne profits and otherwise as the court thinks fit, and, if such conditions are complied with, the court may, if it thinks fit, discharge or rescind any such order or judgment.</p>
	<p>(3) Where any order or judgment has been made or given before the passing of this Act, but not executed, and, in the opinion of the court, the order or judgment would not have been made or given if this Act had been in force at the time when such order or judgment was made or given, the court may, on application by the tenant, rescind or vary such order or judgment in such manner as the court may think fit for the purpose of giving effect to this Act.</p>
	<p>(4) Notwithstanding anything in section one hundred and forty-three of the County Courts Act, 1888, or in section one of the Small Tenements Recovery Act, 1838, every warrant for delivery of possession of, or to enter and give possession of, any dwelling-house to which this Act applies, shall remain in force for three months from the day next after the last day named in the judgment or order for delivery of possession or ejectment, or, in the case of a warrant under the Small Tenements Recovery Act, 1838, from the date of the issue of the warrant, and in either case for such further period or periods, if any, as the court shall from time to time, whether before or after the expiration of such three months, direct.</p>

We desire to be clear as to what is meant by employment. I do not say that the words I have moved are necessarily the correct words to fit the position, but they are words that would be clearly understood by millions of workpeople

who are occupiers to-day. I am afraid I cannot say that the wording of the Bill as it stands is clearly understood, even by Members of the House of Commons. I should like to mention one or two things that I should not consider to be employment such as would warrant a property owner in claiming a particular cottage. Suppose that a man is a mechanic and a sort of handy man, and helps the property owner in keeping his motor car in repair, for, perhaps, an hour or two of an evening. I should not consider that to be employment for the purposes of this Bill. Again, a miner who is a decent gardener may go and help his manager, who has a garden, perhaps, as big as a billiard table. I should not consider that to be employment. Even amongst the workers we have toadies who are ready to bend the knee and go a long way in that direction, as well as in the upper circles. It is in order that we may understand what is meant by employment that I move this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The MINISTER of HEALTH (Dr. Addison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think my hon. Friend is altogether warranted in suggesting that anyone taking part-time employment is necessarily a toady. I think it is quite a self-respecting way of supplementing one's earnings. That, however, is neither here nor there. My hon. Friend's purpose is to secure that the Act is not evaded by someone being given an hour or two's employment, and I think that is a good point. Several cases have occurred in the Courts, and what my hon. Friend has pointed out is an omission in the wording of the Bill. I think it would be best met by the insertion of the words "whole time" before "employment" in paragraph (	<i>d</i>). We have, unfortunately, passed that point how, but if my hon. Friend will put down an Amendment to insert the words "whole time" before "employment" in paragraph (	<i>d</i>) on Report, I will accept it. I think that that is the best way of meeting the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1), after paragraph (	<i>d</i>), to insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>e</i>) the owner offers, or has already offered, the tenant accommodation in the Same dwelling-house, such accommodation
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
being considered by the court as reasonably sufficient in the circumstances, particular consideration being extended to ex-service owners who have purchased houses for their own personal occupation."</p></blockquote>
The object of this Amendment is to do something to remedy a state of affairs which has arisen largely in regard to ex-service men. As the Bill stands, it is possible for a landlord to claim the house for his own occupation, but nothing is said in regard to the case of a landlord who only wishes to occupy a part of the house. There are many houses occupied by families, which, in the present stress of housing conditions, are not fully occupied, and which could quite well be occupied not only by the tenant but also, possibly, by the landlord. There would be no fear of overcrowding in such cases, because the matter would lie within the discretion of the Court. In paragraph (ii), provision has been made for ex service men, but, as I read that paragraph, it only means that, where an ex-service man has been the owner of a house in which he was living, and, owing to the war, has ceased to occupy it, it will not be necessary, if he still remains the owner, for him to prove the existence of alternative accommodation. There are a large number of ex-service men who may have been owners of houses which they sold when they were called up, because it was not possible for them to continue as owners; and there are also a large number of ex-service men who were only tenants of houses, who gave up their tenancy automatically when they were called up, and have since purchased houses which they are now unable to occupy, because, in their case, the provision that it is not necessary to prove the existence of alternative accommodation does not apply. Therefore, there is a legitimate grievance, and, if anything can be done for these men who went to serve their country, I think it ought to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TREVELYAN THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have on the Paper an Amendment in somewhat similar terms to that which the hon. and gallant Member has moved, and I should like briefly to emphasise the point which he has put. I believe the Government are prepared to give it favourable consideration. Owing to the increase in the rigidity of the definition of the alternative accommodation required by the Bill, the ex-service man is put in a worse position than that in which he has been put by the rulings of the Courts
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
under the previous Acts. Under the previous Acts, the Courts have in many cases ruled that part accommodation in the same house was adequate alternative accommodation, but, owing to the increased standard of alternative accommodation required by this Bill, the ex-Service man who, on the strength of previous rulings, has bought a house in order to get accommodation, will not be able to get out a tenant by merely offering him part accommodation in the same house. The purpose of my Amendment is that, where a landlord is an ex-Service man who has bought the house because he has nowhere to go, the Court shall recognise part accommodation in that house as alternative accommodation. We fear that, as the Bill stands at present, owing to the stiffening up of the standard of alternative accommodation, that would be ruled out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think everyone recognises the hardship which some men who have been at the war suffer. They gave up their houses, and on coming back are unable to get possession of them, even on fair terms. We are all, I am sure, anxious to do what we can, consistent with what is practical, to meet those cases. I have spent a good deal of time looking into it, and I think the subsequent Amendment, in the name of the hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Mr. T. Thomson), really covers the ground better with the addition of the words "on reasonable terms" after the word accommodation. With that alteration I have no objection, on principle, to the Amendment, and in that way you would have something to show that the tenant was not exploiting the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment made: In Sub-section (1), after paragraph (	<i>d</i>), insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>e</i>) the landlord became the landlord after service in any of His Majesty's forces during the war and requires the house for his personal occupation and offers the tenant accommodation on reasonable terms in the same dwelling-house, such accommodation being considered by the court as reasonably, sufficient in the circumstances."—[	<i>Mr. T. Thomson.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Subsection (1), to leave out the words "considers it reasonable to," and to insert instead thereof the word "shall."

The Amendment which has just been agreed to does meet some of the difficulties, but I feel when you have laid down certain lines and regulations, if the Court is then to be allowed to take many other circumstances into consideration that is going to lead to a great deal of difficulty. In a letter which I received from an ex-Service man as to this point he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I venture to draw your attention to a point which vitally concerns myself. I owned and lived in my own house before the war. I joined the Army in 1914 and gave up my business and house, letting it to save expense. I was a private in the Army. The tenant is still there. On demobilisation I went to my tenant, who successfully evaded any military service, and asked him for the house. In June, 1919, I gave him three months' notice to quit by September, 1919. He retained possession. I went to Barnet County Court in October, 1919, but the judge, in pursuance of the power he possessed, granted the tenant until May, 1920, to get out. Before that Order could be enforced, the tenant applied for and got an extension until August 20th next, and presumably the business will so drag along. Under the recommendation of the Salisbury Committee, which forms the basis of the new Act, it is stated that there is to be a discretion to grant an ejectment order on the part of the Judge in the case of a landlord who joined the Army and had to give up his house: It would seem that the Legislature have in mind that the ex-Service man has some right in his own house. What I do not like the look of is the unfettered discretion. My contention is that any ex-Service man should be entitled beyond any dispute, and without the exercise of any discretion, to obtain possession of his own house on giving legal notice to quit."</p></blockquote>
If you are going to leave the judge discretion you are going to evade very largely all these exceptions you have put in. Judge Graham, of the Bow County Court, in a letter to the "Times," said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In such cases, I personally, should not think fit to make an order for possession."</p></blockquote>
He gave a number of cases which might, arise under the Bill, and added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The making of it should not be left to the discretion of the Judge."</p></blockquote>
In certain cases, I do not say in all, he does not want that discretion. If you cut out those words everybody will know where they stand and what their rights are. When you pass an Act of Parliament you should make it operative, and not leave it to the discretion of first one and then another. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman, if he cannot accept my words, will do something to strengthen the Clause and enable these people to obtain possession in a reasonable way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir KINGSLEY WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government could not for a moment accept the Amendment. I think it would be most undesirable that the discretion should be taken away from the County Court Judge and that he should not be in a position to consider all the facts of the case. He has got to be guided, and his decisions have to be based upon the Sections enumerated in Clause 5. To deprive the judge of the power to make an order which, in his judgment on all the facts, he considered reasonable would be very detrimental to all the parties before the Court. It would be an exceptional step to set out these four paragraphs and then say he must make the order, even though he might not consider it reasonable or that the circumstances warranted it. It is far better to give discretion to the Court, and in this way you will have more justice done. I remember reading the letter of the judge of Bow County Court, of which my hon. Friend quoted a few lines. I remember also that another County Court judge replied the following day, putting exactly the contrary point of view. I hope the Committee will reject the Amendment and allow all the facts to be brought before the Court, so that the judge can be guided and governed by the terms of the Clause. Under the circumstances, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot withdraw. What the hon. Gentleman has said only strengthens my case. You have County Court judges giving different opinions and how are you going to deal with those gentlemen. It really depends on what they have had for luncheon, or on the condition of their liver and digestion, which may in some cases be against the tenant and in some cases against the landlord. I must press the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir COURTENAY WARNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg the Government to reconsider their decision on this point. We know that some of the County Court judges are not very favourable to ex-soldiers, and I do not think this sort of Clause ought to be left entirely in their discretion. If the word "shall" cannot be agreed to, some such words as "shall except under exceptional circumstances" might be put in perhaps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Sir HENRY NORRIS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening now for two days, and the conclusion has almost been forced upon me that tenants are more or less angels from heaven and landlords are rogues and
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
vagabonds who ought at once to be put away somewhere, but let us take paragraph (	<i>b</i>) and just see on what the Court has to be satisfied with regard to that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the tenant or any person residing with him has been guilty of conduct which is a nuisance or annoyance to adjoining occupiers, or the condition of the dwelling-house has deteriorated owing to acts of waste by or the neglect or default of the tenant or any such person."</p></blockquote>
As I understand, the Court can come to the conclusion that all those things have been proved, and yet they have a discretion as to whether they shall grant possession to the landlord or not, and it seems to me that that is obviously wrong. If there is a tenant in a house who has so neglected his duty as to allow these conditions to have come into existence, I think the landlord ought to be entitled to an Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to join in the appeal to the Government to reconsider their decision. I feel very strongly that when you have enumerated the grounds, as you have in this Clause, the words which follow, "the Court considers it reasonable to make such an Order," are much too loose and wide, and therefore I very much hope that even if the specific Amendment cannot be accepted the Government will give an assurance to the Committee that they will reconsider the matter and themselves propose words which will carry out the purpose which my hon. Friend has in view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. Morison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to appeal to my hon. Friend not to press his Amendment, as I rather think there is some misconception as to what the function of the County Court Judge is under the words to which he objects. It is not a case in which the County Court Judge has an unfettered discretion, either to grant or withhold an ejectment order. He is bound by such regulations as appear in the Clause—and there are four of them—and if the case absolutely fits the particular Regulations the Judge is really bound to decide in accordance with that view. The reason why it is better to leave some latitude to the County Court Judge arises from this, that it is quite impossible beforehand to deal with all the matters which arise in connection with these applications. The question really is whether you do greater harm by tying the Judge by rigid rules or whether you should lay
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
down general rules, as this Clause does, and give him a reasonable discretion for the exercise of his common sense within those rules. Speaking with a very long experience of the Courts, I venture to think it would be much more commonsense and that much more justice is given in the way proposed in the Bill than by laying down hard and fast rules. At the same time, I sympathise very much with the observations which fell from my hon. Friend opposite. I think these cases do raise questions in which the County Court Judge may be helped by regulations laid down by this Committee, and we certainly would be willing to consider any new Regulation which, within the limits that I have expressed, might make it more certain that the Judges' decisions should be in accordance with the views of this Committee. I am sure my right hon. Friend would be willing to consider any added regulation on that line, but it seems to me that the drastic course which is suggested by my hon. Friend goes a great deal too far. I should desire to point out that these words were in the previous Statute, and although I have no doubt that you can occasionally find a case—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NORRIS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Generally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MORISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say occasionally find a case in which a County Court Judge has given an erroneous decision, I know for myself many cases in Scotland where the decision of the Judge has met with satisfaction, and I think, when one finds that in most cases the County Court Judges have under a Regulation like this acted in the past rightly and properly, the presumption is that that course of conduct on their part will be continued, and that it really does not help matters to suggest that on some occasions wrong decisions have been given. County Court Judges are not, of course, infallible, but when you have experience to justify the particular words which the Government invite the Committee to accept, and when you have an offer by us to consider any additional regulation, I think that should meet the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not much impressed by the Government's offer. We have had a great many things postponed to the Report stage, and we are getting rather bewildered at the number of under-
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
takings that have been given, some quite substantial and some rather shadowy, as to what is going to be done on Report. I urge my hon. Friend to press the Amendment, because then the Government will have to put down for the Report stage the Regulation which is apparently now in embryo in the mind of the Lord Advocate. Unless we do give some very clear Regulations to the County Court Judges, there will be this continued element of uncertainty. The trouble in the administration of these Acts is that the landlord and the tenant are both taking part in a gamble. If they get a County Court Judge suspected of being favourable to the landlord's interest, then it will be a good thing for the landlord, but if, on the other hand, the Judge has been known to be favourable to the tenant's interest, it is a good case for the tenant to take, and that is very unsatisfactory. I think there has been rather a tendency in our legislation lately to leave things rather loose. A good case can be made out for leaving a certain degree of latitude, but we are going a little beyond that, and we are putting in many cases discretion on to Judges and judicial authorities that is not really very good for the position and status of the judiciary. It is distinctly embarrassing to many of them, and it is really shirking our responsibility to see that Bills become Acts of Parliament properly and closely drafted and thoroughly thought out. I know it is easy for Parliament to leave the matter to a Court, but, particularly in these thorny questions as between landlord and tenant, you cannot afford to be shoddy, and I recommend my hon. Friend to press the Amendment, if only so that we can force the Government on the Report Stage to put the Regulation and the counter-Amendment down. We have got an accumulation of pledges, and I think it is time we pressed the Amendment and put it into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure we have all been greatly refreshed by the lecture of my hon. Friend, and, of course, feel duly admonished, but at the same time I do not feel in the least guilty. Last night I went carefully over the numerous pledges to which he refers, and I found that, apart from verbal promises, there were four of substance, all of which we have already arranged to meet, and seeing that we have got to the middle of

	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
the fifth Clause of a highly intricate Bill, and as we pass lines, as we did this morning, before a point really arises with full force, the fact that we have reserved even as many as we have for the Report Stage speaks very well for our labours. That is why there is a Report Stage, and I do not therefore feel guilty on that account. My hon. Friend professes to say that it is sloppy work, or some phrase of that kind, if we do not draft our Bills in such a way that they cover every conceivable case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the only logical interpretation of the hon. Member's words. If we were to try and draft conditions covering even the cases that have already arisen you would have a volume of a hundred pages. You cannot do it in an Act of Parliament, as a matter of fact, and I differ from my hon. Friend with regard to the functions of Parliament. I do not think it is the function of Parliament to prescribe in meticulous detail cases relating to every variety of hardship or difficulty which may conceivably arise. It would pass the wit of man to do it, and if we did it we would only make much more trouble for a number of quite innocent people than we set out to do. My hon.

	<p>ticular words are like the laws of the Medes and Persians, but the point is that the Amendment would leave no latitude at all to the County Court Judge. Take the first condition in the Clause: "any rent lawfully due from the tenant has not been paid." If that tenant were one day in arrear with his rent, however reasonable the case, however legitimate the excuse, the County Court Judge would have no option whatever but to give an eviction order. That is a monstrous position to put a Judge in, to say that he shall have no option in any such cases but to make an order for eviction. Then take the next condition. Supposing the tenant played the piano and was a nuisance or annoyance to a neighbour on one night, and the neighbour came and swore a glorious oath that it was a nuisance to him, the Judge is to have no option whatever in such a case but to give an eviction Order. I could go through the whole gamut and deal with every line of the Clause in the same way. I picked out these two points, however, to show how eviction orders could be obtained. I suggest it would be a monstrous thing, and it is not the function of Parliament to legislate in that way. I hope, therefore, the Committee will support us in sticking to these words.</p>
	<p>Question put: "That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Clause." The Committee divided, Ayes, 22; Noes, 5.</p>
	<p>I attach importance to this amendment. I feel there ought to be something in the Bill to prevent recovery of possession merely with the object when recovery is obtained, of selling at an extravagant profit. As far as I can see there is nothing in the Bill which would really prevent the recovery of possession merely with the intention of selling at an extravagant profit. Under Clause 2, paragraph
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
(	<i>a</i>), the landlord can raise his rent, and if the tenant, as a matter of fact, cannot afford to pay, the landlord can recover possession; he can also recover possession if he finds alternative accommodation for the tenant. If hon. Members will look a little further on they will find that if the landlord is able to prove hardship in not recovering possession, if he can find alternative accommodation, he can recover it. It seems to me he could fairly easily prove hardship in many cases by showing, for instance, that his place of business happens to be nearer the house he wants than is the house he is living in at the moment. He might go in for a month, or he might send his servant in to occupy the house for a month, and then having got vacant possession, he could a very little time after sell at a very large profit. I am certainly in favour of good landlords and this Amendment is really only directed against those landlords who try to recover possession in order to sell at a very large profit. I am a landowner myself, and the last thing I would do would be to try and bring in an Amendment against the interests of good landlords. The Government may possibly argue that it is a great hardship that a man should not be able, under all circumstances, to recover possession of his own house. After all it is very unlikely that a man who owns a house would not live in it rent free. If he is living in another house, the presumption is that the house he is not living in, but which belongs to him, is producing a higher rent, and if he chooses to try and recover possession he will lose that higher rent which he has been in receipt of. His only object then in seeking to recover possession would be in order to sell at a high figure. It is quite possible that this Amendment is not drafted properly. I do not pretend to be a draftsman, but I hope that the Government will, somewhere in the Bill, embody the principle which is contained in my Amendment. The landlord will still be able to sell at a considerable profit, because all the Amendment says is, that he shall not be able to sell at a profit which the Court considers outrageous or extravagant on recovering possession.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MORISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have every sympathy with the motive which lies behind my hon. Friend's Amendment. As I understand him, what he desires to secure is that a
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
proprietor shall not get possession of his house by an order of the Court on the ground that he is going to occupy it himself and then cease to occupy it, in order to sell the house at a premium. I take it that is the object of the proposal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MORISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is rather apprehensive that a landlord may take advantage of the provisions of Section (3) in order to secure possession and to sell his house at an enhanced price. Let me point out in the first place exactly the circumstances under which this proviso would operate. It applies only if the landlord has obtained possession on one of the grounds allowed by the Bill, and if the Judge has pronounced an order which permits him to regain possession. That, of course, must be presumed to be a thing which the Committee sanction. He must have been able to satisfy the judge that he is entitled to regain his house. The question my hon. Friend suggests arises in this way: Does the Committee think that there are likely to be any substantial number of cases that will arise for consideration in which an attempt will be made to re-sell at an extravagant price, or does it not think that there are a far greater number of cases in which the landlord, who has properly got possession of his house, may, on account of death, or some accident, or some unforeseen circum stance, be compelled to sell his house, and to sell it at a price which he might have paid some years ago, when prices were totally different from what they are to-day? That might quite well happen if this proviso is passed. I suggest to the Committee that the Bill as it stands is really a sufficient safeguard against the particular evil which I am sure the Committee would wish to stamp out, and which my hon. Friend has in his mind. These cases will be very rare indeed. I do not wish to go into technical matters, but it is right for the Committee to know that it would not be possible to carry out the ideas of my hon. Friend in the scheme which he proposes, because there is no machinery in the Amendment for carrying it out; one does not know who it is intended shall enforce this particular remedy, how the case is to be brought before the Court, or how the Court is to say what is a reasonable price. Although it is conceivable that there may be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
occasional cases in which a landed proprietor might get the better of the Court, and might succeed in securing an extravagant price, such cases will be very rare indeed, and, in view of the hardship which such an Amendment as this would inflict upon proper cases, I suggest that it should rule out the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little disappointed at what the Lord Advocate has said in reply to this Amendment. He allows that there may be cases where landlords may take advantage of the Section to recover possession and sell at an extravagant profit, and yet, because he does not like the wording of the Amendment, or because the Amendment provides no machinery for giving proper effect to it, he says that the cases aimed at will be so few that we need not bother about them. Such a line of argument is not defensible. If there is a loophole in this Bill by which an individual could take an unfair advantage of conditions arising through the shortage of houses, then it is the business of the Government to put it right. If they do not like this Amendment, then they should add this to the large number of other points which are being reserved for consideration between now and the Report Stage, and they should see meantime if something cannot be done to try and remedy what may certainly prove to be an obvious injustice. It is quite true my hon. Friend has moved the Amendment to deal with cases which will be probably very few and far between, but however few they may be I submit that the Government ought to take steps to provide that such cases shall not happen at all, because nothing will create so much dissatisfaction in the country, or in our cities and towns, than cases in which a landlord obtains possession of his house, possibly lives in it for six months or a year, and at the end of that time, while the shortage of houses is still existent, takes advantage of that shortage and sells his house at a very large profit. I appeal to the Lord Advocate to reconsider what he has said and to bear in mind that if his statement goes forth to the public, it will cause a lack of confidence in the people who are entrusted with the administration of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir THOMAS BRAMSDON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one serious objection to this Amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
which has not yet been mentioned. It provides that if a landlord obtain possession, it shall be unlawful for him to sell such premises. Look at the difficulties that will create in regard to the title of the property to be sold. The conveyancer does not always trouble about the right to sell; his object is, as a rule, to find an appropriate purchaser for a given sum. If, as the result of this, there was a flutter in the dovecotes, conveyancers would have to go to the Courts, in order to find out whether such-and-such a step was reasonable and lawful. I am sure that my hon. Friend who moved this Amendment did not mean to create that difficulty. In order to get over it, some other strong explanatory Clauses would have to be put into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. GRAHAM</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable sympathy with the point of view expressed by the hon. Member for Wood Green (Mr. Locker-Lampson). It seems to me that what he really has in mind is getting at a certain class of proprietor, who, by something which, perhaps, does not amount to fraud, but is perilously near it, gets possession of His house. According to my view, the way to remedy that is not to prohibit, as this Amendment apparently would, the sale of property, nor yet to give power to a County Court or other judge to say that a certain percentage is to be given. We have no guarantee as to what view the judge would take, and I presume he would be governed by the market rates for property for the time being. If that is so, this Amendment would afford no protection at all. I think that what my hon. Friend really intends would be met by some power of having an order revoked, if it had been granted under conditions which were not those understood by the Court, and which amounted to fraud or imposition upon the Court, or if there was some purpose which was not apparent at the hearing before the Court. It seems to me that that could be met by the insertion of words in Subsection (3) providing for the revocation of such an order after such time and within such limits as the Court shall consider proper, where it becomes clear afterwards that the purpose of the owner of the house was to obtain merely temporarily possession, for an ulterior purpose which it is the object of the Act to prevent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

who is not in sympathy with the objects of my hon. Friend. Having listened carefully, however, to the debate. I have, personally, come deliberately to the conclusion that the balance of advantage is on the side of the Government in adhering to their words. I think that probably my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LUNN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Subsection (1), to leave out paragraph (	<i>i</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe it is provided in this Bill that its life shall be three years. I do not suppose, however, that there are many members of this Committee who would agree that the present shortage of houses will have been removed at the end of three years. There will be a tremendous shortage at that time, and I think we should protect a tenant who is the occupier of a house, even though it be as a condition of employment, so long as the rent is guaranteed. Before the war, in many districts, there were many empty houses, and I have known employers compel their employés to live in cottages owned by the employers because tenants
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
could not be got otherwise. Should the landlord to-day, because there is no accommodation, and when, in some cases, there are two, three four or five families living in a cottage, be allowed to turn them out because the tenant may have left his employment? I have known instances of houses being let to various sorts of inhabitants in a district, and when the employers desired the houses during the shortage, the whole population has risen against the turning out of the tenants. In one case the assistance of the Coal Controller was invoked, because miners were to be turned out of houses, owned by a railway company, in favour of railwaymen. In various parts of the country there are cases in which a whole village, practically, is owned by the employers in that locality. I know of mining districts where practically every house is owned by the colliery company. Yesterday I saw in the newspapers that the Scottish mine workers, realising the difficulty, passed a resolution amounting to threats, which I need not quote, if this paragraph is carried into Law. I have no desire to use threats or to encourage them, but they are in the resolution. Again, we have not passed the age of strikes. Although many of us would like to avoid strikes, they do happen in some districts where it would be possible for the employer, under this section, to turn everyone out. We have seen people living in tents in the middle of winter who were evicted during a strike. People have been living in churches and chapels because the employer has evicted them. This provision, if it remains, will permit that to continue. The shortage of houses being what it is, if an employer is in the privileged position that he can make his employé live in a particular cottage, he should, like other landlords, be bound to provide alternative accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that this Amendment cannot be accepted. If the Committee will look at the terms of this paragraph they will see that it provides that no order for ejectment is to be made even in this case, but it removes the necessity for the provision of alternative accommodation. This follows the recommendation of the Salisbury Committee. It must be borne in mind that, for this provision to operate, there must
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
be three conditions; firstly, that the tenant was in the employment of the landlord or a former landlord; secondly, that the dwelling-house was let to him in consequence of his employment; and thirdly, that he has ceased to be in that employment. It was obvious to the Salisbury Committee, and it will be obvious, I think, to many members of this Committee, that in a case like that of a farm, where it is necessary that the employés should be on the spot, it would be impossible to conduct the business of the farm otherwise. There are many other cases, and I do not think there can be any division of opinion that, where those three conditions obtain, it is obviously desirable, not so much in the interests of the landlord as of farming, trade and business generally, that such provision should be made, and that some steps should be taken in order that the employé may occupy the house or accommodation which has been specially built for him. There are cases that have arisen out of the War, in which people have gone there for special purposes and have left, and many other circumstances could be mentioned. I think I have said sufficient to satisfy the Committee that this is a reasonable proposition for the general good of the community, and it is recommended by the Salisbury Committee as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir C. WARNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend who has just sat down that this Amendment is impossible, but I do not know whether something might not be inserted in the Bill to prevent this applying in, say, large manufacturing districts, where all the houses are in the hands of one owner. The point is a difficult one. The case has been mentioned where colliery owners have all the cottages, and I throw out the suggestion that such cases, which might mean wholesale ejectments, should be covered in some way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HAYWARD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would ask the Government to consider the point which was put by the mover of the Amendment, and which has been emphasised by my hon. Friend who has just spoken, namely, the case of colliery houses. Such houses come within the three conditions laid down, and if the landlord cares to take action, there could be wholesale ejectments. In many of these large villages, which are practically towns, of 6,000 or 8,000 inhabitants, the whole of the houses
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
belong to the colliery, and consequently they come within this provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. CARTER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that those responsible for answering questions this morning do not appreciate fully the point raised by my hon. Friend. I can imagine many cases in which employés have met with accidents, and have been approached with a view to accepting a lump sum to liquidate the obligations of the employer. I have many cases in mind where people have accepted a lump sum as a final settlement of their case, and have remained no longer the employés of that particular company, but at the same time they were living in the house. Unless some provision is made whereby this class of worker is protected, they will be subject to eviction. Again, there are hundreds of cases where men have been discharged through no fault of their own, and, unless something is done to protect them, they will be turned out of their houses. If something is not done to protect this class of worker in the colliery districts, there will be trouble there. The workmen will not tolerate the eviction of people under the circumstances which we are trying to prevent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MORISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to point out to the Committee exactly the effect of this Amendment. If a man is discharged from his employment, then he may be turned out of his house; but if he voluntarily leaves his employment he is not bound to go. That is the effect of the Amendment. It does not, as it seems to me, really meet the point which the Bill makes, which is to make it certain that the person who is going to do the work in connection with which the house has been built shall get possession of the house. It applies to farms and to many other businesses. The hon. Gentlemen asked for special consideration for mining areas, and great industrial employment. I am sure they do not expect me to make any statement as to that. They have put their point very clearly, and my right hon. Friend (Dr. Addison) will certainly give consideration to the views they have expressed. With regard to the instance mentioned by my hon. Friend (Mr. W. Carter), I scarcely think that point arises under this Amendment, because a case where a miner meets with an accident, and compounds his compensation and leaves his employment, is a case in which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
the County Court judge, or sheriff in Scot land, is not bound to give a removal order. The class of accident is just the special and exceptional case, and it seems to me that the County Court judge would not give an order to eject. The man in that case is protected by the discretion given in the Clause. For these reasons I suggest the Amendment should be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I think it may be taken for granted that we shall move an alternative Clause on Report. The wording of the Clause now appears to be rather loose and vague. There may be many cases in which a house was let from a point of view which would not amount to an essential condition of employment and we should at least insist that the house was given as an essential condition of the employment.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-Section (1, iii), after the word "or" ["or, in the case of"], to insert the words

This is to rectify what appears to be an error in drafting, in this sub-Section. Under it, the landlord who purchased before September, 1917, is allowed a special advantage in not having to provide alternative accommodation. The landlord, who, before the Bill was printed, purchased a house which is now brought within the provisions of the Bill for the first time, is also given that benefit. The Government appear to have overlooked the unfortunate individual who purchased a house towards the end of 1918 or beginning of 1919, which at that time was not within the provisions of the Rent Restrictions Act but which was brought within the provisions of the first of the two Acts passed in 1919. I speak particularly of Scotland where landlords in several cases purchased a house say in the Autumn of

1918 or early in 1919 with the object of obtaining possession on 28th May. He did not know the Government proposed to introduce a Bill or its terms. The Government introduced a Bill which became law on 2nd April, and which raised the rental limit. That individual has never been able to obtain possession and unless something is done he will not be able to obtain possession for another three years. For no reason for which he is responsible he is being denied possession of the house he purchased in order to live in for five years. I imagine the same conditions apply in England.

The object is to prevent if possible a landlord selling a house which may answer all his essential requirements, for the purpose of putting forth the plea that he is about to be rendered homeless and in that way claim possession of a house of one of his tenants. It may not appear a very real danger, but a fortnight ago in one day nine tenants in Birmingham were dispossessed on those grounds. It will thus be seen what serious possibilities may arise.

There are very great difficulties in the way of any landlord carrying out that scheme, and the landlord always has to satisfy the Court, even under the provision as it stands, that greater hardship will be caused by the Court refusing than granting the application, and therefore, I think, as the hon. Gentleman himself admitted, that this is a case which will only happen on extremely rare occasions. I confess, however, I was rather moved by the information which he gave the Committee that he had already nine cases in mind in Birmingham in which persons had suffered from the operation of that particular scheme, and if my hon. Friend would let me have information which would show that there was any real likelihood of a number of such cases arising, I am sure the Minister of Health would be very glad to reconsider the whole matter. Meantime, I am afraid I cannot accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to press on the Government further consideration of this matter. I think the Clause giving up alternative accommodation is a very great concession and one that ought to be exercised within the narrowest limits. We all have had similar instances in our industrial constituencies to those mentioned by the hon. Member who moved the Amendment, and therefore it is desirable that this door should not be open to landlords to obtain possession of houses. I think we ought to guard the right of the tenant to alternative accommodation, and if you do give it up it requires the protection which is shadowed in this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move to leave out Sub-section (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am viewing the whole of the Act as likely to end in an enormous amount of litigation all over the place. The costs will be enormous, the lawyers will benefit, and neither tenants nor landlords will get any satisfaction out of it. This Clause proposes to go back upon pretty well everything you have done with your previous Acts, and it seems to me that it is entirely unnecessary. You have gone out of your way to ask the County Court judge to do something that he decided was not in the interests of the parties previously, and now according to this Subsection, where "any such order or judgment which has been made or given"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is speaking to another Amendment. The Amendment which he is moving is to leave out Sub-section (2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I am reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought the hon. Member was reading from Sub-section (3). May I appeal to the Committee. If we are to finish the Bill to-day, we ought to try and get at least Clause 5 by lunch time. If we do not do that, I do not think that we are likely to finish to-day, and I therefore appeal to hon. Members to shorten their remarks as much as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not keep the Committee long, but I was reading from Sub-section (2), which says—
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the case of any such order or judgment which has been made or given, whether before or after the passing of this Act, and not executed, at any subsequent time, the court may adjourn the application, or stay or suspend execution on any such order or judgment, or postpone the date of possession, for such period or periods as it thinks fit."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>262</span>
I am bearing in mind this letter that I have received from this ex-soldier, and I have received a great number of letters in exactly the same way. It hits them very hard indeed, and it is not right to allow the Court to re-open all this litigation that has happened. All the Acts that have been brought in have created friction between landlord and tenant. I appeal to those in charge of the Bill that they should try and stop litigation as much as possible, and therefore I move the emission of this sub-section.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government cannot accept the Amendment. The Clause simply gives a County Court judge the right at any time, on an application, to stay or suspend an execution and otherwise to vary an Order, and obviously the tenant or landlord should have the right of applying to the Court to vary the operation of an Order in certain circumstances. It is the old point over again, that no discretion is to be left with the Court, and I think the Government have sufficiently demonstrated the necessity for some elasticity in that matter. I do not think a mass of litigation need be apprehended in connection with this Bill. I think you will find that the vast majority of landlords and tenants will, as in the past, come to a sufficient and orderly arrangement amongst themselves without recourse to the Courts, and I do not believe there is going to be this vendetta that my hon. Friend indicates. As regards costs, I would point out that under the Bill these matters will be dealt with in the County Court, where the costs are small, and therefore all these fears and bogeys which my hon. Friend puts forth in support of his Amendment will not, I hope, be accepted by the public outside as any indication of what the probable result of this legislation is likely to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. REMER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support the Amendment, and, in reply to what the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0130">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>263</span>
hon. Gentleman who has just sat down has said, I would remind him that there have been extraordinary decisions given by the Courts on the previous Acts. There has been a great deal of sympathy with tenants and none whatever for the property owners, who are very often placed in a most difficult position. I had a letter this morning from a parson who was injured in France and suffered from shell-shock and who cannot for some technical reason get into his own house. Therefore, I think there is some considerable case for the omission of this sub-section.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have withdrawn my Amendment if it had not been for the provocative speech of the hon. Member representing the Government, who went out of his way to state what are not facts and not proved, and he must know it. There is a very large number of actions with regard to tenants who never would have raised them if it had not been for this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in sub-section (2), after the word "fit" ["as it thinks fit"], to insert the words "or may order the payment of any lesser rent than the increased rent permitted by this Act."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After what you have said, Mr. Morant, I will cut my remarks down to a minimum. A Court may suspend an Order for recovery of possession or may refuse it or postpone it, but they are not given any power to reduce or alter the rent. In a good many cases the tenants will not be able to pay an increased rent because their income has perhaps not only not increased but has actually diminished during the war, and therefore I think there ought to be some provision to enable the Court under the circumstances to reduce the rent payable by the tenant. I rather understood the Government had indicated their intention of dealing with this. I would add that it is not my Amendment, but it was suggested by the Salisbury Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MORISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I personally have every sympathy with the views of my hon. Friend. On the other hand, I am afraid it is not possible to accept his Amendment as it stands. May I suggest to the Committee that the Minister in charge of the Bill will give this particular topic reconsideration, as he indicated yesterday, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
will endeavour on the Report stage to frame a form of words which will meet the point? I cannot go further than that, and I hope the Committee will not expect me to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member press his Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are mortgaging the Report stage very considerably. I rather gathered yesterday that there was a promise on the part of the Government to put down something in this direction, and I cut my remarks to-day very short because I believed they were going to do that. Unless I can get a really definite assurance that this point will be met on Report, I am afraid I cannot withdraw my Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did say, when the matter came up yesterday, that he would see if it was possible to frame a reasonable Clause in relation to the recommendation of Lord Salisbury's Committee which my hon. Friend has quoted. I think that is a fair statement to make of the position, and I hope my hon. Friend will accept it. Obviously one feels in a little difficulty in pledging a Minister in his absence, and does not want to go further than he went. I fancy that, if anything, I have erred to-day rather on the side of being too cautious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cannot you accept these words?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is obviously impossible. It would be open to very strong objection to ask the County Court judge himself to fix the rent. It would be putting an undue burden upon him. I am sure the Minister will do all he can to meet this particular point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not like having to leave this to the Minister. I have cut my remarks as short as possible, in order to follow the advice of the Chair man, but I do not think we ought to leave these things to the Report stage. There has been a perfect avalanche of promises already—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only five or six.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is possible that the words of my Amendment may not meet the case from a draftsman's point of view, but unless the Government can definitely pledge itself to put some-

	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>
thing down on Report, which will enable a tenant to have his rent reduced under these special circumstances, I do not think I ought to be asked to withdraw my Amendment. I hope the consultation now going on among those in charge of the Bill will result in some such pledge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry I had to leave the Committee for a short time in order to fulfil an engagement entered into before I knew of the arrangement made for the sitting of this Committee. I apologise to the Committee for having had to be absent a short time. This Amendment is a good illustration of the necessity for allowing discretion to County Court judges. If I remember aright, an hon. and gallant Friend behind me last time managed, to his own satisfaction, to draw me a bit on the question of the discretion to be given to County Court judges, on an Amendment which would have left them no discretion. This Amendment proposes to give them too much discretion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A great deal too much!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Amendment is too wide. At the same time, we know that Lord Salisbury's Committee have made a recommendation in respect of poor tenants. My hon. Friend is very anxious that we should not postpone everything until the Report stage. I will make him this offer, that I accept this Amendment on the understanding that we may provide an improved set of words if we find it necessary on Report It is too wide as it is. We do not want to make the County Court simply a rent court. The Amendment obviously wants qualifying, but, on the understanding that the feeling of the Committee is generally in favour of it—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir PHILIP MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are very much opposed to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am willing to leave it open to the Committee on the understanding that, if it is accepted, we shall propose better words on Report, and we shall be open, without any suggestion of a breach of faith, to limit it materially by the insertion of appropriate words later on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My objection is that the Amendment gives power to the County Court Judge to fix the rent, and I think that is quite beyond any power which he should be called upon to exercise. Any words which will give such power will certainly meet with the opposition of a large number of Members of the Committee. However the rent may be lowered or altered it certainly is not the duty of the County Court Judge to fix the exact amount to be charged, and we object to that on principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already by this Bill given more than enough discretionary power to the County Court Judge. This is opening the door very widely indeed to abuses which might easily develop in a direction which, I am quite sure, my hon. Friend would deplore as much as I do myself. Therefore I hope the Government will reject this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much obliged to the Government for accepting my Amendment. The Committee ought to realise that in accepting it, the Government are not really tying themselves down to this form of words. They simply say they accept the principle, in certain special cases; that the tenant should have his rent reduced, and on report they will devise some better form of words to meet these special circumstances. Therefore, in agreeing with that the Government has said, the Committee is not tying itself down to any form of words, but is simply accepting the principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We object to the principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. BRAMSDON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Government will not concede this. They had better reconsider the whole matter before the Report stage. It is a much more difficult subject than it appears to be on the face of it. It opens up the whole question of enabling County Court Judges, in almost every case brought before them, to consider whether or not the rent ought to be reduced. Litigation will result to an enormous extent. Almost every advocate before the Court will in these cases raise the question of reducing the rent. Therefore I say it would be much better to leave the whole matter until the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir C. WARNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I look on this as a very serious Sub-section. On Clause 2 we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>267</span>
had a long discussion, and the Minister himself said that it was vital that these percentages should be maintained. Now the whole thing is to be swept away by this form of words and be handed over to the County Court Judge. It will upset the whole Bill, if it is going to be put into the hands of a County Court Judge, as this Amendment provides. If it is carried, I shall vote against the Bill and everything in it, because it is a most mischievous Amendment. It will lead to litigation and upset the principle on which the Bill is based from beginning to end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I came in at the end of the discussion. I recollected the recommendation of Lord Salisbury's Committee. I confess now I have read and reread these words they are much wider than I first thought, and I really must ask the Committee, while recognising the importance of the recommendation of Lord Salisbury's Committee, and of doing what we reasonably can to meet it, to allow me to reconsider the whole question between now and the Report stage. These words would turn the County Court into nothing else than a rent Court. There is nothing in the Amendment about special cases. I am afraid I must ask to be allowed to reconsider what I have said, and, notwithstanding the objection to deferring things to the Report stage, I must ask the Committee not to accept the Amendment, but let us consider whether any form of words can be introduced later on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very averse to raising difficulties in this matter. Do I understand from the right hon. Gentleman that he will put down something definite for the Report stage to meet these exceptional cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. MAGNUS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman does not make any promise at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman will make that promise, I will withdraw my Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot make that promise. I have had some considerable experience, as has my hon. Friend, that when one begins to enumerate conditions
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>
he soon gets a page of qualifications. I am well aware of the recommendations of Lord Salisbury's Committee, and we tried to frame words to carry it out, but we found it practically impossible without prescribing whole schedules of conditions which we did not want to put in. I will consider the suggestion again, and see whether we can bring up any suitable words which are reasonably appropriate to the specially hard cases mentioned by my hon. Friend. I would not like at this stage to give any promise. I am sorry to disappoint my hon. Friend, but I am sure his Amendment as it stands would make the County Court Judge's Court nothing but a rent Court, and we cannot have that now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. REMER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support my hon. Friend who moved this Amendment. If we are going to give this power suggested in this Sub-section, I shall vote against it altogether, because, so far as I can see, the only people who would not be liable to have their rents reduced would be the very few people my hon. Friend referred to yesterday, bad landlords who will not keep their houses in repair. These are people who ought to be severely punished, and their cases ought to be laid before the County Court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot understand the position of the hon. Member who last spoke. He objected to the whole Sub-section, and now he approves of an Amendment which would weaken the whole Bill, and make it practically a. farce. I have been taken to task by one of the Ministers in charge of the Bill, on the ground that I said this measure would not end litigation. As a matter of fact litigation is blowing over now, under the old Act. I hope the Minister will make some stand. If you are going to whittle away the effects of this Bill, instead of its being a blessing, as I thought was possible when it was brought in, I fear it will be a curse, and it will only end in much litigation and trouble, while it will not prevent that feeling of irritation between landlord and tenant, which these Bills in the past have engendered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no wish to delay the Committee, but, as so many things are being carried over to the Report stage, I must reserve to myself the right to move on Report some of the Amendments standing in my name. I think we really must take away some of these irritating little Clauses from the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These words are simply reproduced from the Act of 1919. It was found to be necessary to make some provision with regard to orders made before the passing of the Act, and, as far as I know, it has been found to work quite smoothly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. GRAHAM</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (3), after the word "given" ["at the time when such order or judgment was made or given"], to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or where it subsequently appears that the order or judgment was given under conditions which were not then fully apparent to the Court, and for a purpose not at that time disclosed."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Wood Green (Mr. Locker-Lampson) stated the case of sale, and pointed out that, in certain cases, that was really the ground on which recovery of possession was sought, although it was not at the time disclosed to the Court. If it had been disclosed, recovery of possession would not have been given. The object of these words is to provide for the rescinding or revocation of the order in cases where the full facts were not, for one reason or another, disclosed at the time when the application was made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that this is intended to cover what would, in effect, be an abuse of the process of law, that is to say, when a person has made an application and gets possession of the house,
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
on some ground not disclosed, and then, perhaps, proceeds to sell it at a handsome profit to someone else a few weeks afterwards. No one wants the Act to be evaded in that way. It is difficult to accept a manuscript Amendment in a highly technical Bill like this, but the draftsman advises me that, as far as he can see, the words would only have that effect, and would simply cover cases where there has been an abuse and the Court has been misled. I have, however, only had it just now, and my hon. Friend must allow me, if I accept it, to do so on the understanding that I may have to modify it, or even oppose it, later on. It appears to be quite fair in itself, and I will accept it on that understanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The point raised by this Amendment is a limited, but not unimportant one. The object of my Amendment, which I move purely in the public interest, is to exempt railway lands from the restrictions which are imposed on them under this Clause, as to the recovery of possession of any dwelling to which this Bill is to apply. As hon. Members know, all railways hold, and are bound to hold, land for the extension of their lines, for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>273</span>
stations, works, and so on, in addition to the land actually used for railway purposes, at any given moment. That is a practice which has been repeatedly approved by Parliament, and has been recognised as necessary for the carrying on of the business entrusted to railway companies. The practice would have been impossible if that discretion had not been given by Parliament. I am sorry there is no representative of the Ministry of Transport here. I wish there were, because I cannot but believe that he would have warmly supported this Amendment, which, as I have said, is purely in the public interest. If there had not been some such provision inserted in railway Bills, developments could only be carried out at ruinous cost. That cost, as things are at present, must react not upon the dividends, but upon railway rates and fares. It happens that land which is held by railway companies for extensions is frequently, and indeed generally, occupied by buildings and by houses very often, and those houses are in the ordinary course let to tenants until wanted for the purposes for which they have been acquired under the authority of Parliament. It is obvious that it is essential, if the purpose of Parliament is not to be defeated, that the land when wanted should be available. The railway companies, who are landlords of large numbers of dwelling houses, let them on terms which enable them to recover possession at short notice. This is a common form of agreement on which the large railway companies let such premises—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The landlords may, after the expiration of fourteen days' notice in writing to the tenant of their intention so to do, which notice may be given at any time, re-enter upon and retake possession of the said land and premises or of any portion thereof they may require for purposes of their railway or works connected therewith without payment of compensation to the tenant."</p></blockquote>
The Bill in its present form will make it impossible to recover possession of houses to which it applies, and the result will be that improvements and extensions which are urgently necessary for the development of traffic may be held up. There is an important precedent for the Amendment. In the Finance Act of 1909–10 Parliament recognised that in respect of that Act statutory companies were entitled to
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
particular consideration in respect of land held for the purposes of their undertakings, and such land was expressly exempted from undeveloped land duty, as well as other land duties, on the representation of dock and railway companies that they were compelled to hold the land for future development. I repeat that this is an Amendment which is being moved on behalf of statutory companies which are carrying on duties imposed upon them by Parliament and which claim for that reason to be in a rather peculiar position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess I do not like this Amendment very much. As it stands, it might apply to any sort of statutory company—and there are a good many of them of different kinds—and it does not say that the premises in question are required for the purposes of the undertaking. They may have been acquired for the purposes of the undertaking, but it does not say that the particular premises which they wish to pull down are here and now required for such purposes, which is a very important qualification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am willing to insert those words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then there is nothing with respect to the obligation of alternative accommodation, and I do not quite see that a statutory company should be in any better position in respect of that than any private owner. In fact, it is a greater hardship on a private owner to have to be under an obligation to supply alternative accommodation than it would be to an important company. I have only mentioned two objections, which I see at once, to the Amendment, and both, I think, are very important objections, and I am afraid, therefore, I could not accept it as it now is. Perhaps my hon. Friend could discuss it with his friends and see whether he could submit a proposal of a better kind. I am not saying I would accept it, but I am sure this proposal would not do. On the question of bare justice, the whole point is based on housing shortage. We require alternative accommodation, except in certain limited cases, because of that housing shortage. We place that obligation even on the smallest private owner, and I do not see why a big public owner should be exempt from the same responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Clause 7 proposes certain restrictions upon the mortgagee, calling in his mortgage. As long as the interest be paid, and the covenants of the mortgagor are kept, and the mortgagor keeps the property in a proper state of repair, the mortgage cannot be called in. There are on.; or two exceptions provided for, and one is the case of mortgages which are made payable by periodical payments covering principal and interest. This, of course, is a class of mortgage well known to every Member of the Committee, namely, building society mortgages. I believe this exception was taken from the original Act. I have no doubt that there were two considerations which decided the Government at that time in making this exception. The first, undoubtedly, was that it is necessary that the periodical payments which cover principal and interest should be kept up. It probably occurred to the Government that, as a matter of fact, building society mortgagors were protected, because it was thought that there was no power in build ing societies to call in their mortgages. That is not so. I know that there are cases in which building societies reserve themselves the right to call in their mortgages. That is, by ordinary notice of instalments being in arrear. Now, if that be so, and building societies are exempted from the operation of this Bill, they can merely give notice to call in their mortgage, and in that way increase their interest. This is more than a mere academic question, because, as a matter of fact, I know of a very large building society which, during the course of the operation of the original Act, attempted to put up its interest in this way. My Amendment provides that so long as the periodical payments are not more than 21 days in arrear, the building society mortgagor, like every other mortgagor, should have the benefit of these provisions. I venture to say that above all classes of mortgagors whom every Member of the Committee would desire to protect is the building society mortgagor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The point that I endeavour to bring out in my Amendment is that all building society mortgages, whether for the term of five, ten, or more than ten years, should be treated on the same basis. You will notice that the period from which the mortgages are to start is from the date of the actual mortgage. It may well be that the mortgages originally taken out for ten years may be reduced to terms of about five years. I do not think that there is any reason why there should not be equality, simply because the words happen to be taken from an Act which was framed in 1915. The fact that some things which ought to have been done were not done then is no reason why they should not be done now". Any borrower who borrowed his money from a building society, where principal and interest are payable over a term of fifteen years, is entitled to the same protection as a mortgagor who took money for a term of less than ten years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think my hon.

That would be quite impracticable. It would only require some instalment system, of any period less than ten years, to defeat the whole general purposes of our mortgage provisions. I would agree to making the ten years longer, but to put it at less than ten years would certainly defeat the whole purpose of the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I move this Amendment in order to ascertain why the restrictions on premiums should not apply to the renewal or continuance of a premium for a term of 10 years or upwards of any tenancy. My concern is that, in order to escape
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
the restrictions set forth in this Section, there might be a disposition to take premises on such terms. It is quite common at present for leases to be renewed at the standing rent, on payment of a premium of, it may be, £50 or £100.

The operation and general incidence of these Acts is, we hope, going to be of a short term duration, and therefore we do not want to legislate to cover long term leases.

My Amendment seeks to put the man who has paid up to date in the same position as the man who is in arrear, and to make the amount irrecoverable as regards the past as well as the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment is moved in order to meet a number of cases of real hardship which have already occurred, where the husband dies and the widow has not been recognised as his legal representative or as the tenant in succession of the house. It is a fact that a widow who was left in possession has had to turn out, and I am quite certain it is contrary to the spirit of the Act, and to the intention of this Committee, that because the breadwinner happens to die therefore his family shall cease to have the protection which they have enjoyed during his life. I hope that the Minister will be able to give, not merely sympathetical regard to this Amendment, but go further and put that sympathy into practice by accepting this definition. Whether it goes quite far enough, I am not quite sure. There is also the question of daughters and sons, but this Amendment is enough to raise the general question. I hope if we cannot give the whole we shall, at any rate, retain the family in possession, with the protection which the Act has given, so long as the breadwinner is alive. When he has gone, surely they are in greater need of protection than before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This part of the Bill is a reproduction from Section 21 (	<i>d</i>) of the 1915 Act. I am not aware of cases, and my legal advisers are not aware of cases, where the difficulty anticipated by my hon. Friend has arisen, and the Act has been in operation now for five years. We would all desire that the widow and the family should have the protection which my hon. Friend wants to secure for them, provided they continue in occupation of the premises or wish to do so. I should have thought the words "deriving title" under the original Landlord and Tenant Bill would have covered them. There is a conceivable case if a man died intestate, but I have as a matter of fact come across cases where the contrary is the case. But we could not put in the words that my hon. Friend proposes because that would give the widow the right, even if she were living somewhere else, which would be improper and against his intention as well as mine. I will inquire further into it, and if it be thought that in the case of a person dying intestate there is any doubt
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
about it, we are prepared to consider words to meet the case; but I am advised that no difficulty has occurred in the definition of the word "tenant". I will look into it from that point of view.

I have put this Amendment down because the County Courts in many areas meet at very irregular intervals. My suggestion is that we should include Courts of Summary Jurisdiction. I think you will have to have some words like these, because I do not think the County Courts in the country will be enough to deal with the cases that will arise. A great number of instances no doubt will occur where people will think they have a case, and I think you should not send people to a distance.

For instance, under his Amendment you might have in country districts, instead of a County Court, a Bench of Magistrates dealing with these matters. How far my hon. Friend would like that I do not know, but I think it would lead to a great deal of difficulty in many respects if Benches dealt with matters of this sort. As I said this morning, I do not apprehend this flood of litigation which my hon. Friend anticipates. I think the vast majority of landlords and tenants will be able to come to a satisfactory arrangement under the terms of this future Act. It may be there will be a few test cases, and they will decide a good many of the others. It is quite open if there be a large number of cases for special sittings of the County Courts to be arranged to deal with them. I hope my hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of this Amendment is to make this Act apply to every house, irrespective of what its rent may be. In moving this Amendment I venture to think that I am quite consistent, because I opposed the maximum of £75 in the last Act. The reason I venture to suggest that all maximums should be done away with is this: Either this Act is a good Act or it is a bad one. If it is a good Act, why should the tenant who has to pay rent of £110, or any figure from £105 upwards, be deprived of its benefit? In my own borough there are a large number of residential flats where, I happen to know as a matter of fact, the rent has been increased from £120 to no less a sum than £350, and those tenants have not the slightest protection of any kind. I will call attention to another anomaly. The maximum under the old Act was £75. A landlord, where he had a tenant paying a rent of £76, would be entitled to raise his rent. If he raised the rent to £106, again he is outside the provisions of this Act, but if he raised the rent to £104 the tenant would have protection. It seems to me that an anomaly of that kind at once shows its absurdity. I do venture to think that every tenant, no matter what his rent may be, should have the same protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's root and branch Amendment, I quite agree, knocks the bottom out of the whole thing It is not a question whether this is a good Act or a bad Act. It is purely and frankly a makeshift provision for dealing with an emergency which we all hope and trust will pass. We have allowed in it an increase of rent, with the intention of trying to get things towards an economical level. As my Friend explained, it is simply part of the general policy to restore housing. But my hon. Friend's Amendment would include, let us say, Chatsworth House and park. It is true that wherever you impose a limit you always produce anomalies. When the
	<span class='label label-info column'>288</span>
limit was £75 you might have somebody with £74 19s. and somebody else with £75 5s. You must have a border line if you have a limit, and there must be some cases that are above or below. But to propose that we should extend this to every class of premises, however expensive, seems to me to defeat our main purpose. What have we found? Why are we trying to limit it as much as we can? Because we find it is destructive of the incentive to build, and my hon. Friend would spread that desolating influence to every building in the land. I hope at this time of day we shall not spend much time in discussing the Amendment. With great respect, I think it is quite impossible. It would include every building, however expensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is purely a matter of drafting. I move the Amendment in order to ascertain if my right hon. Frend is quite satisfied that this Clause does cover the case of a flat where a whole block of flats, of which one flat forms a part, is rated at over £105 per annum. It is purely a point of construction, because the sub-Clause, after stating that the Act "shall apply to a house or a part of a house let as a separate dwelling, where either the annual amount of the standard rent or the rateable value does not ex-deed," goes on to say, "in the case of a house in the Metropolitan Police district, £105." I do not know, but it seems to

and to insert instead thereof the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that in the case of any mortgage comprising one or more dwelling-houses to which this Act applies and other land the mortgagee shall be entitled by notice in writing to the mortgagor to apportion the principal money secured by the mortgage between such one or more dwelling-houses to which this Act applies and such other land, and thereupon this Act shall not apply to that part of such principal money apportioned to such other land to which this Act does not apply."</p></blockquote>
In practice this Amendment raises a point of very real and substantial importance. As the Bill is drawn, in the case of a mortgage—and there are many such—where the principal money is secured on several properties, some of which may come within this Bill and others of which do not come within the Bill, then if the rateable value of 10 per cent. of the whole comes within the Bill, the whole mortgage is included within the Bill. I venture to suggest that that is not the way to deal with this question, and that very grave hardship is inflicted by pursuing this course. I suggest that the proper way of dealing with it is to enable the mortgagee to apportion his principal money among the various properties—to say it applies so much to the property coming within the Act and so much to the property outside of the Act, and that the principal money secured by the property or apportioned to the property outside of the Act should not come within the Act. Let me give an illustration which has been brought to my notice which will at once show the Committee exactly what I mean, and the hardship of retaining the Clause as it stands at present. The case I have in mind is that of a man who some years ago lent a very large sum of money on mortgage on various properties for a period of five years certain at 3¾ per cent. interest. The five years expired during the opera-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
tion of the original Act, and therefore the whole mortgage for the purposes of the Act comes within the Act. As a matter of fact this was a mortgage covering a brewery and other properties, and it so happened that 10 per cent. of the whole was property within the Bill—dwelling-houses. Therefore this mortgage is now tied up in this way, although a great portion of it covers a brewery, at 3¾ per cent.; yet under the provisions of this Bill that mortgage cannot be called in and the interest cannot be increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see any reason in the world why the part of the mortgage money which is apportioned to property outside the Bill should not be on all fours like any other property. It was never intended to cover this class of case, and it is in order to remove that injustice and enable the mortgagee to apportion the mortgage money among the various properties, so that, having done so, the Bill will only apply to that part of the money coming within the Bill, that I move this Amendment. I say quite frankly that I am not altogether satisfied with the Amendment as it is drawn, but I should like to hear what my right hon. Friend has to say upon the principle of the Amendment. If he agrees to it in principle, probably the words can be amended later on during the Report. These words were drafted rather hurriedly, but I do feel that it is necessary to give the mortgagor this protection, so that when the mortgage money is apportioned among the different properties he should be entitled to redeem any part of the property by paying the principal money apportioned to that particular part of the property. It may be that, in cases of difference or dispute, there should be some power vested either in some tribunal, or arbitration, or court to settle the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that my hon. and gallant Friend has raised a point of real difficulty, which always arises when you fix a margin. As I was saying a few minutes ago, you have cases which are just below or just above the limit; and in the case that he has quoted, where the money lent on mortgage comprised a brewery and other property, it came within the provisions of this Act. The other property happened, in this particular case, to be worth more than
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
one-tenth of the whole sum. That is his case. He says, therefore, it is hard on the mortgagor, who happens to have lent money at a very low rate of interest some years ago, at all events, so far as that part of the property which is outside the scope of the provisions of this Bill is concerned, not to be allowed to make some reasonable increase in his mortgage rate of interest. In order to do so, however, he would have to separate his mortgage into two parts—one on property under the operations of this Act, which, of course, would be governed by the terms of this Act, and could not be altered except in that way, and the other which you could deal with as a free commercial transaction. I agree that, so stated, it is quite a reasonable case. The principal Act, of which this is merely a reproduction, the 1915 Act, provided that that liberty to alter the mortgage should not apply where the property coming under the operations of these Acts was worth one-tenth or more of the total value of the mortgage, and that happens to be the case in the instance quoted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and gallant Friend's Amendment suggests a procedure which I am sure would not be right. It would give the mortgagee a free right, against which there would be no appeal, to allocate the mortgage, which may be very unfair to the mortgagor. I can quite imagine that the mortgagor may say to himself: "I will have the biggest slice of this mortgage on the property just outside of this Act, and the smallest slice of the property inside the Act; then I will do well on the bit that is outside." That may be very hard on the mortgagee if he was quite unable to pay off the mortgage in respect of which he was being somewhat hardly dealt with. You could not give the right of apportionment to the mortgagee with no appeal against it. My hon. Friend's suggestion is that that will automatically be right because the mortgagor will pay off if he allots to him too small an amount of the property under this Act. He may, however, be quite unable to pay it off, he may be unable to raise the money from any source. I think if you had any apportionment at all it could only be apportionment by a court or an arbitrator. It could not be at the unfettered discretion of either of the parties. That would be quite wrong, and I could not accept the Amendment with that in it at all; but I will look
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
into it with him with a view to seeing whether we can formulate any practical proposal. I see it is a hard case, but there are a good many hard cases, I am afraid, inside and outside of these Acts, and they are incidental to the times in which we live. I agree it is hard. It is also hard on the people who have lent money on property inside these Acts, and who are limited as to what they can do with it. If the hon. and gallant Member will discuss this matter with my legal advisers, who are fully aware of the point, I shall be obliged, and perhaps between them they will be able to make some practical suggestion. I am quite sure the scheme of the Amendment would not operate satisfactorily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my right hon. Friend that the machinery which is proposed in this Amendment would be quite inadmissible. It is obvious that you could not leave it to the mortgagee to dictate on what portion of a property the mortgage or a portion of the mortgage should be allowed to rest. But, on the other hand, I agree with my hon. and gallant Friend that he has raised a point of real substance—that this Act was never intended to apply to mortgages on breweries or other property of that kind. At the same time I think my hon. Friend will agree that there were not very many philanthropists in this world who were lending money on breweries at 3¾ per cent. interest in the year 1914. I think the case which he has cited must be an exceptional one, but the fact of it being an exceptional case does not touch the principle. If I may respectfully say so, I think he has raised a point which deserves very careful consideration at the hands of the Committee, and I hope he will not part with his Amendment without some very definite assurance that his wishes will be met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It does not cost so much in the way of fees, and the stamp duties are only 1s. per cent. instead of half-a-crown, and the equitable mortgage generally contains a Clause that the mortgagor will execute a legal mortgage whenever called upon. But for all intents and purposes it is a mortgage. The borrower has received the money, and it is owing in exactly the same way as it would be with a legal mortgage. Personally, I can see no reason for any difference in treatment, and because I believe in consistency in all things, I move the Amendment which is down in my name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the first place, I must remind the Committee that this is simply a reproduction of Section (2), Subsection (4), of the 1915 Act. With reference to my right hon. Friend, I think it has a little to do with it, inasmuch as Parliament has already sanctioned this particular Section. It has already been discussed and has come into law. Secondly, of course, this particular Section applies more particularly to loans that have been obtained from bankers, and it is the opinion, and it was the opinion, of the House when this matter came up in 1915 that if this was excepted, as my hon. Friend desires to except it, it would be destructive of obtaining ordinary facilities for credit, especially short term credit. For that reason it was deemed inadvisable to deal with it in the way my hon. Friend suggests. Another reason is that it is obviously not so necessary to protect a mortgagee in connection with a measure such as this for restricting rents, because, obviously, a transaction of this kind is far more remote than one which would affect, as the other part of the Section does, the occupier of premises. I hope, under these circumstances, that my hon. Friend will see his way not to press the Amendment this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Subsection (8), to leave out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the assessment of rateable property the rateable value of any such dwelling-house

	<span class='label label-info column'>295</span>
(other than a reconstructed dwelling-house) to which this Act would have applied if it had been erected before the said date shall be calculated as though this Act applied to the dwelling-house, and as though the standard rent were the rent at which a similar dwelling-house would have been let at the date by reference to which the standard rent is calculated"</p></blockquote>
and to insert instead thereof the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"to rating the gross estimated rental or gross value of any house to which this Subsection applies shall not exceed—
	<ol>
	<li>if the house forms part of a housing scheme to which Section seven of the Housing, Town-Planning, etc. Act, 1919, applies, the rent (exclusive of rates) charged by the local authority in respect of that house; and</li>
	<li>in any other case the rent (exclusive of rates) which would have been charged by the local authority in respect of a similar house forming part of such a scheme as aforesaid."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
This Amendment raises an important matter. It will be remembered in the Second Reading of the Bill some animadversions were indulged in by various Members of the House as to the wording of this Sub-section, and I must admit that I felt there was some justice in what was said. I confess I myself read it over a great many times before I quite clearly understood its purport. Therefore I did promise to put down an Amendment with a view of making it clear. The general purpose, of course, is to secure that we have no inequity as between the assessment of the new houses and the existing houses of the same kind in the same place. What is happening now is that in some places the new houses, for which, of course, a very much increased rent, I am glad to say, is being obtained, as compared with other houses of the same kind in the locality, are being more highly assessed in consequence. Therefore the unfortunate tenants find themselves in the position of occupying a house in the same street with a friend occupying a similar house but erected pre-War, and not only paying an increased rent because of the increased cost of building, but also, in consequence, having to bear sometimes twice the rates that their neighbour has to bear. That is clearly unfair, because we are arbitrarily limiting the rent which shall be paid on the older houses. We are artificially limiting their rents and we are not artificially limiting the rents of the new houses,
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
and the local burden should be spread equally. Therefore, in order to make the matter clear, I propose that the words after "relating" in line 36 shall be omitted to the end of the Clause. I quite agree they do not place this matter on very clear terms, and I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar will make some reflections upon it. However, notwithstanding his desire for simplicity, I would like to assure him with great respect that it is not very easy, with the best will in the world, to express these matters in quite simple language. I think we have got it here as well as it can be got. We have said that this Act shall not apply to a dwelling-house, and so on, but for the purpose of any enactment relating to rating
	<br><blockquote><p>"the gross estimated rental or gross value of any house to which this Sub-section applies shall not exceed (	<i>a</i>) if the house forms part of a housing scheme to which Section seven of the Housing Town-Planning, etc. Act, 1919, applies, the rent (exclusive of rates) charged by the local authority in respect of that house; and (	<i>b</i>) in any other case"</p></blockquote>
that is, subsidised houses or houses built by a public utility society
	<br><blockquote><p>"the rent (exclusive of rates) which would have been charged by the local authority in respect of a similar house forming part of such a scheme as aforesaid."</p></blockquote>
That is to say, the basis of assessment for the new houses will be the rent, exclusive of rates, which is charged by the local authority in respect of the new house. That is taken as the basis, and not its value or the cost of its construction, which has entered into the consideration of the assessment in a large number of cases. Then there are the other houses built under the new conditions where a private person has let them at the best rent he can get—subsidised houses or built by a public utility society. In order to get equality, we suggest in (	<i>b</i>) that in the case of those houses it shall be the rent which would have been charged by the local authority in respect of a similar house forming part of such a scheme. They will have houses to go by in their own district which will guide the Assessment Committee in making their assessment. I think that is as fair a basis as we can devise. At all events it does remove what is now a real grievance, namely, that some authorities are taking the exaggerated cost of construction and what would be an economic rent on that, if you could get it, as a basis for assess-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>297</span>
ment, which is clearly most unfair to the newly-constructed houses as compared with other houses of the same kind in the same place. Therefore, the fairest guide, which is a firm guide and which is not open to all kinds of dispute, is to take the rent which is actually charged by the local authority for the new house, as the basis. Even then the new houses will be, I think, a little hardly dealt with as compared with the old houses, but at all events, it is more near equity than any other firm line which we can think of, and I think the words of the proposal are, at all events, much clearer and much more definite than those in the Clause as first presented to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the object which my right hon. Friend has in view, which, as I understand it, is that when a considerable amount of money has been spent on erecting property that should not tell against the person who has expended it by an increase in his rates. As a general principle I quite agree, but I am bound to say that I think this very partial application of the principle will land him in very great and serious difficulty. He adopts a standard which is, at any rate, understandable so far as the houses erected by local authorities are concerned, and then he goes on to say that he will give the benefit of this new system to any houses erected by public utility societies or by a private builder who builds under the subsidy. But, as I understand it, the subsidy is a subsidy for this year only.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RAFFAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite aware of that. The subsidy is a subsidy for this year only. But what happens to the private builder who proposes to build a house next year? He is not only deprived of the subsidy of £200, which he can obtain this year, but in addition to that he will have to pay the full rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. If you will read the Amendment it says, "any other case."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If I put it in the form of a question it will perhaps get the matter clear. My difficulty is with regard to the private builder who undertakes, to build houses after he is unable to secure the subsidy. After all, we do hope that there will be some; private building of houses for working people during the period that this Act continues to operate. What we desire is that private building should be resumed at the earliest possible moment. I think we are all extremely anxious that there should be no undue handicap as against the person who undertakes that. For this year he has the benefit of the subsidy of £200. It may or may not be necessary to continue that subsidy next

year; but if the subsidy is withdrawn, what I am anxious about is that he should be put in no worse position next year if he builds without a subsidy than is the person who undertakes to build with a subsidy this year. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar, I do not profess to be skilled in the legal interpretation of phrases. I should not have imagined from reading this proposal that the case is covered. I shall be very glad if the right hon. Gentleman will assure me it is, and that so long as the Act is operative any house which is built under it will always have the advantage of securing the rating being placed on the same basis as the person who builds this year, or as the house built by the local authority, or by the public utility society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only gave the case of the houses built under the subsidy—the public utility society houses—because they are unfortunately the class of house, with a few exceptions, which are otherwise being provided. But, of course, it does not refer to them in the Clause, and I can give my hon. Friend at once the assurance which he is asking for. If he looks he will see that if the house forms part of a housing scheme and so on it applies under (	<i>a</i>) and "(	<i>b</i>) in any other case"—whether built this year or next year or under subsidy or not under subsidy so long as the operation of the Act continues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is a very small Amendment, but I think it is a very necessary one. It might create a great deal of anxiety and trouble if the word "knowingly" was not put in. I take it there will be no objection to its insertion and therefore I move accordingly with as few words as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot accept the Amendment of my hon. Friend. His Amendment would make it read "if any person in any rent book or similar document knowingly makes an entry …. he shall be liable to a fine." Obviously a person who makes an entry in a rent book must do it knowingly. What I think my hon. Friend has in mind is that he should not have some evil intent or something of that sort. That, of course, would be a matter to be considered by the Court in the event of the case coming before it, and it would then have to be dealt with on its merits. You cannot have in an Act of Parliament the words "if a person knowingly makes an entry" because if he makes an entry he must make it knowingly. The question of what his motives were is a matter for the Court to consider. When an entry is made, obviously it must be made knowingly, and by the intent of the person who makes it. I think my Friend can be assured that there will be no question of penalising anybody who makes an error or commits an oversight or anything like that. That is a matter which would have to be considered by the Court when the case was being heard. When a man makes an entry obviously he must make it knowingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir C. WARNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is something to be said for the word "knowingly." He does not know necessarily that it is irrecoverable under this Act. That is the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Otherwise, as this Clause stands, I do not think it is necessary for the prosecution to prove 	<i>mens rea,</i> and a perfectly innocent mistake would subject the unfortunate landlord to a fine. I do hope the Government will accept some such words as I have suggested so as to make the matter clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The word "knowingly" occurs in other Acts of Parliament. It is frequently used to make it clear that the mistake must be an intentional one and not simply an ordinary error. Although I quite see the hon. Member for Woolwich reads the Amendment in a particular way (which I must say I have not looked at in that way before), I do feel there is a necessity for making this particular Sub-section clearer than it stands at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this word be put in or even the alternative words suggested by my hon. Friend, it would mean placing upon the other party the onus of proving that the entry was put in knowingly. As far as "knowingly" is concerned, I cannot conceive of any person, except he was in a state of somnambulism, not making an entry knowingly, because he makes the entry and of course he knows he is making it. What my hon. Friend means, I think, is that he is doing it to deceive somebody or other. Therefore, if the Amendment is accepted, you would have to prove that he made the entry with an intent to deceive. That would be exceedingly difficult to prove, and no Court, I am certain, where a slip or error of transcription or anything of that sort got into a document, would dream of inflicting any penalty. In reply to my hon. and gallant Friend, I think it is the uniform experience of Statutes in which the word "knowingly" has been inserted that it has practically defeated the intention of the Statute. It is almost impossible to prove the "knowingly," just the same as it is almost impossible to prove the intent of the person who makes the entry. It is placing a burden upon either the plaintiff or the Court, which it is almost impossible to discharge, and it has been a very general experience in regard to many Acts that the insertion of words to this effect has stultified the whole intention of Parliament, because it cannot be proved that it was done knowingly or that it was done with some intent or other. You must take the facts
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>

I am bound to say as a lawyer that I think the Amendment is right. I cannot conceive that anyone should be punished for an offence unless that offence be knowingly committed, and I think my right hon. Friend will agree that in all penal statutes that word is invariably put in. In fact, I cannot conceive that it should be omitted. If something get into a book accidentally, it is very wrong that anybody should be punished for it; in fact, it is contrary to all the principles of law. I appeal to my right hon. Friend to protect any person who accidentally or inadvertently inserts words in a book from being punished unless he does so wilfully and with intent to defraud.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Your suggested new Clause appears to me to be outside the scope of the Bill, and I am going to rule it out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was rather afraid that there would be some difficulty with regard to it, and that is why I raised the point at this moment. This Section say "25 per cent. in excess of the limits so specified". Twenty pounds is the specified rateable value in London, and if you put the rates and the increase in rent on the top, you will bring it outside the compounding amount. You are not going to hit the landlord by that, because you have already stipulated that he shall place the rates, whatever they are, upon the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the assessment goes up, as in many instances it will do, under this Clause, 25 per cent. will not cover the increase. Therefore I do appeal to my right hon. Friend to hold this Clause back, because he is giving the tenant a back-handed advantage. There is not the slightest doubt about that fact. The tenant has to pay the rates, and, if the assessment he raised, he will have to pay the additional assessment as well. Therefore it is not a question of so much in the pound. It is a question of assessment upon the compound amount. I do appeal to the Minister to put something in so that during the continuation of this Act the assessment for rating purposes should remain the assessment in force on 3rd August, 1914. If you do something of that kind, it will cover a point which is not only a difficulty, but something that will happen. I feel convinced that 25 per cent. would not cover it. Before we pass the Clause, will my right hon. Friend see his way to deal with it so that the additional impost is not put on the tenant and the rent raised unduly</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a little difficulty in apprehending what my hon. Friend wants to do. I should have thought that if he wanted to raise the limit he would have put an Amendment to alter the 25 per cent. That appears to be the only interpretation I can put upon his words. We were bound to make an increase by some proportionate amount; otherwise the increases of rent which we allow in the Bill would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>305</span>
bring in large groups of property outside the compounding limit. Therefore we had to raise the limit an equivalent amount to keep it out of the compounding limit. When you take into consideration the various amounts, 25 per cent. is mathematically about the right figure. Although my hon. Friend has made statements to the contrary, I do not think that he has given facts which would lead us to the conclusion that he draws. If my figure be not correct, I do not mind allowing a little here and there. You could not stereotype the assessment for one class of property and not for other classes of property in the same horough. That would make our inequalities even worse than they are. at present, and I should hope, if we continue, that we may be able to make some suggestions which will deal with the basis of assessment before the three years are up. I sincerely hope we shall. Points two and three are obviously necessary. First, there is the question of access, which we have mentioned, and the other is necessary in the interests of landlords. Unless we have words to this effect, his claims may be invalidated in respect of those cases, because he has accepted a week or two's rent, which would be clearly unfair. This Clause is necessary in order to meet injustices which have arisen, and, as there have been no Amendments, I think it is acceptable to the majority of the Members. If 25 per cent. be not enough, I will look into it again. I am not at all averse from putting in a little more, but I think this figure is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I may explain the purposes of the Amendment in this way. The Housing Act of Scotland of 1911 provides that, where in any borough or district the population is less than 20,000, the houses which are rented at £10 or under shall have the assessment paid by the owner; if the population be between 20,000 and 50,000, then the corresponding rental shall be £15, and where it is 50,000, the rental shall be £21. In these cases the owners are liable for the payment of rates. The Bill, as at present drafted, provides that the new amounts fixed shall be simply 25 per cent. beyond the previous limits. The Amendment has only taken account of the larger towns, in which the rental fixed is £21, and probably, if the Minister sees fit to accept the principle of the Amendment, it would require some further alteration. I wish to secure that tenants who are not liable to pay rates shall not under the new conditions find themselves called upon to do so. If they have not been used to paying rates, and are going to be asked to do so under the new circumstances, there are sure to be difficulties. Apart from that, it seems to me that 25 per cent. is not a large enough increase to make. We are going to allow an increase' of rental amounting to something like 40 per cent., and it seems to me that an increase of that amount should be allowed in these instances too. I have put down £35 as a possible figure. If it be not, I am quite prepared to accept whatever figure the Secretary for Scotland thinks it right. It seems to me that there is a real difficulty, in that these tenants, who have not been accustomed to pay rates, will feel that they have a grievance if, after this, they are called upon to do so, even although the rent they are going to be charged under the new circumstances is proportionate to the rent they were charged before. I hope that the Government will see fit at any rate to accept the principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

hon. Friend will not press it, for reasons which I can state quite shortly. The Committee will observe that we have already passed, in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of Sub-section (1), the following:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A reference to Section (1) of the House Letting and Rating (Scotland) Act, 1911, shall be substituted for a reference to Section 3 of the Poor Rate Assessment and Collection Act, 1869."</p></blockquote>
That refers back to Section 15, which we have just been considering, and therefore it is provided that Section 3 of the Poor Rate Assessment and Collection Act shall have effect as though 25 per cent. were added to the limits there imposed. We have already decided, therefore, that in Scotland 25 per cent. shall be added in the same way as under the English Act, and it is difficult to accept an Amendment which is really inconsistent with a part of the Section which the Committee has already passed. Moreover, on the merits there are also objections to this Amendment. What my hon. and gallant Friend seeks to do is to legislate with regard to one class of houses only, included under the House Letting Act of 1911. He has very truly said that there are three different classes of houses included under that Act, namely, houses in a burgh with a population of less than 20,000, with a population between 20,000 and 50,000, and with a population of 50,000 and upwards. For some reason he ignores the first two of these classes, and only proposes to legislate with regard to the third. Accordingly, from his own point of view, his Amendment is incomplete.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MUNRO</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not only incomplete, as my hon. and gallant Friend agrees, but it is inconsistent with the principle of the Bill, expounded in Section 15, which proposes to add 25 per cent. to the existing limits under the English Act. Instead of adding a percentage, my hon. and gallant Friend proposes to add a specific sum. The addition of 25 per cent. would bring up the figure in Glasgow, in which my hon. and gallant Friend (Major Henderson), who will probably speak after me, is interested, to £26 5s. That is the meaning of 25 per cent. on £21, which is the limit in Glasgow to-day. If this Amendment were accepted, the figure in Glasgow would be brought up to £35. It is difficult to justify that sort of legislation in Scotland as compared with the
	<span class='label label-info column'>310</span>
addition of 25 per cent. provided in England. The whole subject of the percentage, whatever it may be, is going to be looked into again by the Minister of Health, as he has promised. I undertake that I also will look into this matter, in conference with my right hon. Friend, against the Report stage, and, that being so, I trust that my hon. and gallant Friend will not press this Amendment, imperfect as he admits it to be, at this particular stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the right hon. Gentleman has said in regard to this matter. There was another Amendment dealing with this question, which we had to withdraw because it only applied to certain houses, and we put this down in substitution for it, perhaps rather more hurriedly than we ought to have done. The right hon. Gentleman stated just now that the houses in Glasgow covered by the House Letting Acts, 1911–1920, that is to say, the £21 houses, will now be £26 odd. According to statistics, I think they are more likely to be £29. Twenty-five per cent. will bring it up to £26, but the increases allowed under this Bill will bring it up to a figure more like £29. If you throw in the increase in owner's rates as an increase of rent from the tenant's point of view, it will make it from £30 to £33; so that 25 per cent is certainly not enough as regards the House Letting Acts in Scotland. We should try and establish the 	<i>status quo,</i> and not allow this Bill to interfere with it in any way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I feel certain that that is going to cause friction, and it was particularly with a view to preventing friction that we put down this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As the Secretary for Scotland knows, term day in Scotland is the 28th May. Because it comes a month earlier than in England, we had to have a special Suspensory Bill for Scotland. In Glasgow they generally complete their contracts for the ensuing year during February or March, and in the country districts it is often done as far back as January. It is desirable that contracts made before this Bill was introduced should be carried out. Under those contracts, the landlords agreed that any increases which were allowed to them under the existing Acts should be received by them. When those Acts are repealed by this Bill, the result will be that, unless words to this effect are put in, no landlord in Scotland will be able to receive any increase of any kind until Whit Sunday, 1921, although the increase in mortgage interest will become effective before that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>e</i>) Sub-section (6) of Section seven of the House-Letting and Rating (Scotland) Act, 1911, is hereby repealed, and in lieu thereof the following provision shall apply:—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Every assessing authority shall, in respect of the occupancy of small dwelling-houses, allow to owners from all occupiers' assessments levied on and recovered from them in place of the occupiers (less any repayments in pursuance of a claim under this Sec-
	<span class='label label-info column'>312</span>
tion) such deduction to cover cost of collection, as may be fixed by the sheriff on the application of the assessing authority, or any ten or more persons having an interest, after such intimation by advertisement or otherwise as he thinks fit, and after such inquiry, if any, as he may deem necessary;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Provided that, after such scale of deduction has been in operation for a period of not less than three years, it shall be competent for the assessing authority or for any ten or more persons having an interest to present a petition to the sheriff for reconsideration of such scale, and the sheriff, after such intimation by advertisement or otherwise as he thinks fit, and after such inquiry, if any, as he may deem necessary, shall fix and decide a scale of deduction accordingly, but after the expiry of a period of not less than five years from the date of such decision, and thereafter at intervals of not less than five years from the date of the final interlocutor by the sheriff, on the reconsideration of such scale, the scale may, subject to the like procedure, be re-submitted to the sheriff for reconsideration.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Provided further that the sheriff shall not fix a scale of deduction exceeding five pounds per centum, and it shall not be competent to appeal from any decision of the sheriff under this Section."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary for Scotland will remember that, when this particular Section 7 of the House Letting Act was passed, it was arranged, under that Section, that the amount allowed to the landlord in Glasgow for collecting rates which are compounded for, should be 2½ per cent. The amount allowed in outlying districts outside Glasgow was also 2½ per cent., subject to revision by the Sheriff at a certain future date. I am given to understand that the outlying districts have had their rates revised, and, whilst in Glasgow the allowance still remains at 2½ per cent., it is 5 per cent. outside. It costs 5 per cent. now to collect those rates, and the landlords have to pay 5 per cent. to the factors for that purpose. They can only recover 2½ per cent. themselves, and so, as far as Glasgow is concerned, they are actually 2½ per cent. out of pocket. I am sure that is not what is intended. I think it would be better if the rata were made uniform over the whole of Scotland. If the Sheriff at any future date considers that it should be revised, he has then power to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

ment at first, but, from what I have now heard from the hon. and gallant Member, I am afraid it is outside this Bill. It refers to the collection of rates, and not to increases under these particular Acts, and therefore it would not be in Order on this Bill. Had I properly understood it at first, I should probably have ruled the Amendment out of Order to begin with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1), at the end, to add the words

This Amendment is designed to fit this Bill into the term days in Scotland. The Secretary for Scotland knows that the term day has already passed, and, if this Bill is allowed to come into operation when it passes, it will come, not only in the middle of a term, which we cannot help, but in the middle of a quarter term, and that will cause a great deal of inconvenience. It would be better if the increases allowed under Section 2 came into operation on the 28th August, that is to say, three months after the 28th May; and, similarly, if the Acts were allowed to expire on the 28th May, 1923, which is the term day in Scotland. I hope it will be possible to meet that point, which will lead to considerable convenience in the working of the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MUNRO</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am impressed by what my hon. and gallant Friend has said, but I find myself in the same position as with regard to one of his former Amendments. It would not be possible to accept this Amendment in the form in which it is. In the first place, one would have to consider the fixing of the date for the coming into operation of the Act as a whole. It would be exceedingly inconvenient to say that Section 2 should come into operation on one day, and the remainder on a different day. If the principle of the Amendment is to be applied at all, it would have to be applied to the whole Statute. If that were done, it would be necessary to prolong the operation of the Suspensory Act which we have just passed to maintain the 	<i>status quo</i> in Scotland. I sympathise with what
	<span class='label label-info column'>314</span>
my hon. and gallant Friend has said with regard to the convenience of bringing this Act into operation and ending it on a quarter day, and, agreeing as I do with that view, I shall endeavour to put down something on the Report stage which I think will meet the point he has in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. GRAHAM</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1) at the end, to add
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>e</i>) Nothing in Section Two, Sub-section (1), paragraph (	<i>b</i>), of this Act shall entitle the landlord to add to the rent any increase in rates subsequent to the third day of August, nineteen hundred and fourteen, for which, according to the rating system in Scotland apportioning the burden of rates between landlord and tenant, the landlord is liable."</p></blockquote>
I think the Secretary for Scotland will agree that this Amendment touches a question of considerable importance in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>315</span>
Scotland. Under the Sub-section of this Bill to which the Amendment refers, all increases in the owner's rates after 3rd August, 1914, are added almost automatically to the rent charged upon the tenant. I cannot speak for English conditions, but in Scotland the rates are apportioned between the landlord on the one side and the tenant on the other. To us Scottish Members, it appears that within recent times there has been a departure from this principle, which I confess we find it somewhat difficult to trace. At the moment the departure appears to be contained in paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of Section 9 of the Rent Restriction Act, 1919. It is clear from that there was some earlier provision, but at all events the words employed there are to this effect:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Or where, by the law of Scotland, owners' rates are chargeable on the landlord of any dwelling-house."</p></blockquote>
According to the inquiries we have been able to make, it appears that this concession was made partly because, in Scotland, owners of property carried burdens which are not carried by the corresponding owners in England, and this was one method of giving them the benefit, on the old 10 per cent. basis, which was given to proprietors in England. In order to put proprietors in Scotland in the same position, something more was required, and instead of giving them a differential percentage, this proposal was embodied, which added to the rates of tenants all increases of landlords' rates since August, 1914. There was a general feeling in Scotland that, in normal times, all increases of owners' rates would be added to the rents in due course. For the purposes of the War conditions, we were restricting rents, and it was necessary to keep that restriction in view in any special concession accorded. I desire briefly to indicate what this means for Scottish tenants, and to try to show what I regard as the substantial injustice which this proposal might contain. A statement has been prepared by the Dundee Labour Housing Council, which shows that in Scotland the average increase in owners' rates is between 1s. 1d. and 1s. 2d. in the pound, the average increase in the occupiers' rates at the same time being 2s. 1d. The same statement gives statistics applying to some of the larger Burghs in Scotland, where, undoubtedly, the increases under this particular Clause will be more. In
	<span class='label label-info column'>316</span>
the case of Aberdeen, the increase, is 1s. 6d. over the owners' rates in 1914–15. In the case of Clydebank, which, I think, is a storm centre in these matters, it is practically 3s.; and in Glasgow, which, again, is a centre of acute controversy on this Bill, it is, on the average, about 1s. 6d. In Johnstone, also in the West of Scotland, it rises to 1s. 10d., and in Paisley and other West of Scotland centres it is 1s. 8d. It is plain that if, under the automatic operation of this Clause, that increase in owners' rates is going to be added to the rentals demanded from the tenants in Scotland, we have absolutely no idea where the amount is going to end, or what the position is going to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a much discussed statement prepared by the City Assessor of Glasgow, it is shown that, on a house rented in 1914 at £10, the increase in owners' rates, over the figure for 1914, is to-day £2 1s. 10d. If we go to the other extreme, namely, £90, covered by this Bill, the increase in owners' rates would be £18 16s. 1d., but that is probably not relevant, as being beyond the limits of this Clause. If any special hardships fall on any Scottish proprietors quite clearly this is not the way in which to meet them. It is important that we should not merely make an increase of that kind, in the case of Scotland, which makes it impossible for the tenants to say what their rents are likely to be. We have also in mind, however, that this is really an invasion—an accidental invasion probably—arising from War conditions, but now becoming very substantial on the system followed in Scotland of apportioning the rates between the landlord on the one hand and the tenant on the other. While the increase was small and negligible it did not count to the same extent, but in the proposals of this Bill very substantial increases have been passed by the Committee, applying, not only to Scotland, but also to England and the country at large. In Scotland we are opposing this also, because it must be a progressive increase in rental in the shape of owners' rates, which bound up year by year, and I contend that we should hesitate before we embark upon that in Scotland, where resentment has been very keen on this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>317</span>
in which it is expressed, although I agree with my hon. Friend that the question he has raised is an important one. He has said that there was an accidental invasion of the law of Scotland under War-time conditions. I think he may not have been present at the time, but I can assure him that the deliberate enactment in 1919 was no accidental invasion, but a thought-out proposition submitted to the House of Commons on my own responsibility, and accepted by the House. What he is now seeking to do is to alter the law as it was fixed by the Act of 1919. The justification for the Act of 1919 in this particular was that it was thought proper to place landlords in Scotland in the same position—no better and no worse—than landlords in England. I want to do the fair thing if I can. Let the Committee consider what is the position. In England I am assured that all rates are levied upon occupiers, and that the occupiers pay practically all the rates. In Scotland, as my hon. Friend has said, that is not so; the rents are apportioned between the owners and the occupier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the landlord in Scotland be precluded by this Bill from raising the rent, surely it is hardly fair to him that that rent should be further restricted and reduced in his hands by a rise in the rates. If such a rise takes place in England, it falls, not upon the landlord, but upon the tenant; and therefore the result of accepting my hon. Friend's Amendment would be that in Scotland the landlord would have to pay for the rise in rates, restricted as he is in raising his rent by this measure; whereas if the rise took place on this side of the Border, the liability would be the tenant's and not the landlord's. If that restricted rent be paid to the landlord in Scotland, and the land-lord be precluded from any relief in the matter, his position would be worse, obviously, than that of the landlord who is separated from him by the Tweed. The justification for the proposal in the Bill of 1919 was ample and complete. Whether it is possible with regard to the future to find any ease or not, whether the present system can be stereotyped at the present day, is a matter which I am prepared to consider and look into before Report. But absolutely to undo what Parliament deliberately did in 1919 is a large proposition, and I do not think it would be equitable or desirable. Therefore, with every desire to meet any reason-

able argument which my hon. Friend can present and, if I may say so, he always does prevent reasonable arguments—I can hardly accept the Amendment as he has moved it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened very carefully to the Secretary for Scotland, and I am afraid he has omitted certain points which are very relevant to this Debate. In the first place, I would remind the Committee of what I have said on a former occasion, namely, that this placing of increases of landlords' rates on the tenant is not yet operative in Scotland. Clause 9 of the Act of 1919, which applies the measure to Scotland, says that the increase shall not come into force until six months after the conclusion of the War, and the War is not yet concluded. From the point of view of actual practical working, I think this Amendment would give rise to no difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MUNRO</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and gallant Friend will remember that I did not say the Clause was in operation. I said it was on the Statute Book, which he does not dispute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not implying that the right hon. Gentleman had made any deliberate error, but was only reminding the Committee of something which occurred on a previous occasion, when there was a discussion on the subject. Again, the Committee stage of the Rent Restrictions Bill in the spring of last year was taken on two days, the latter of which was a Friday, which, as is well known, is always a very difficult day for Scottish Members. The particular Clause applying the Bill to Scotland was not in the original Bill, but was introduced by the Secretary for Scotland, without any previous notice, on that Friday. The Report stage was taken on the same day, within an hour, almost, of the introduction of that Clause; and, with practically no discussion on the Clause at all, except that I think two Scottish Members mentioned the fact, the Clause was embodied in the Bill, and it passed into law. I maintain that adequate discussion never took place on this Clause, which was really slipped into the Bill, I do not say intentionally, but perhaps by accident—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MUNRO</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in the least.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>319</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HENDERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the whole rating system of Scotland was thereby altered, although a large proportion of the Scottish Members were probably not aware of the fact at all. The Secretary for Scotland, when he introduced that Clause, adduced, as his justification for it, the Hunter Report. There have been two Hunter Reports, one in 1915 or 1916, dealing exclusively with Scotland, and one in 1918, dealing with the whole country. It was from the later Report that he quoted, in which the Committee said that there should be equality of treatment in all parts of the country on this question. I maintain that on this question there is equality of treatment already. Although this Bill deals with a particular class of house, the Committee will observe that the rents in Scotland for that particular class of house are relatively higher than in England; that is to say, £90 as compared with £78 in England outside London, which we can leave out of consideration for the moment. In former Rent Restriction Acts the same difference occurred. For the same class of property a higher rent is obtained in Scotland, because the landlord has to bear a certain proportion of the rates. Therefore the landlord in Scotland is getting additional benefit because of the percentages allowed under Section 2 of this Bill; he gets a larger percentage of increase for the same class of property than if he were a landlord of similar property in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been stated that the Scottish landlords are under a disadvantage, because in 1914 they were not in as good a position as the English landlords in that year. If Members of this Committee care to look at the Report of the first Hunter Committee, in 1915, they will see that that Committee deliberately stated, after going carefully into the matter, that rents in Scotland were normal, that is to say, not below the usual standard, and therefore that contention does hold water. It is most important that we should try and get some concession from the Secretary for Scotland. If this Clause is allowed to stand, and the increase in owners' rates is placed upon the tenant, the result will be that every subsequent assessment will be larger than the previous one. I am advised by the Assessment Authorities in Glasgow that the increase in owners' rates will be regarded as an increase in rent, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>320</span>
if that is so it will result in a larger assessment, and, every year that the Bill remains in force, the tenant will find himelf faced with a larger increase, simply because he has to pay a larger proportion each year of the landlord's increase. Sub-section (1) (	<i>b</i>) of Clause 2 of this Bill is very mistaken in its drafting in one way. It would remove a grievance to a certain extent if it provided that any increase in landlords' rates thrown on to the tenant should not be liable for assessment so far as the subsequent year is concerned. If the Secretary for Scotland would agree to that I think it might make some slight improvement in the position, and would lead to the tenant being able to look forward, during the next three years, to some sense of security, instead of his being each year in a worse position than the year before. If that is not done, instead of blessings being heaped on the head of the Secretary for Scotland, I am afraid that curses will result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MUNRO</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the permission of the Committee, I will say a word or to in reply to my hon. and gallant Friend. I cannot accept the suggestion that this Clause was passed without any adequate discussion. If that is so, I am not responsible for it. If I remember rightly, the Leader of the Labour party and one or two other Scottish Members took part in the Debate. I quite appreciate, however, the force of a great deal that my hon. and gallant Friend has said, but it does not really traverse my argument on the principle of the matter, and on the justification which, as I thought, and still think, existed for the insertion of that provision in the 1919 Act. At the same time in order to meet him, I am quite willing to do what I ventured to suggest, in the course of my opening observations, I would do, namely, to consider, before the Report Stage, whether, by way of stereotyping these rates and preventing any subsequent rise being laid upon the tenant, or by some other case, the situation can be met. Further than that I cannot go at the present moment, but I hope that my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Major WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, at the end of Sub-section (1), to insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>e</i>) A landlord, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, shall not be entitled in respect of any dwelling-house to which this Act applies to recover from a tenant for the year from the term of Whitsunday, nineteen hundred and twenty, to the term of Whitsunday, nineteen hundred and twenty-one, a sum of greater amount than the annual rent or value of such dwelling-house as entered for that year in the valuation roll made up under and in terms of the Lands Valuation Acts with, in addition, in the case of dwelling-houses coming under the operation of the House Letting and Rating (Scotland) Act, 1911, as amended by this Act, a sum sufficient to recover the occupiers' assessments on the said annual rent or value."</p></blockquote>
The object of this Amendment is to assure that if the landlord gets a higher rental for his house he will pay rates upon that higher rental. The valuation given in the valuation roll is the valuation upon which the landlord pays his rates. If the valuation roll is made up before this Act comes into force, then the landlord will be enabled to get his higher rent, but to pay the rates upon the previous rental. That seems to me to be unfair, and it is in order to secure that the same valuation shall be taken for both purposes that I have put down this Amendment. For instance, if the Amendment which was moved by my hon. and gallant Friend, but which has been withdrawn, to make the Act come into force from the 28th day of August, had been accepted, and the Secretary for Scotland said he would consider the question, it would result in the valuation being for the next year the old valuation and not the new valuation, so that the landlord would get the benefit of the old valuation for the purpose of pay-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>ing rates, but the new valuation for the purpose of collecting rents. It has been pointed out to me that this Amendment may cut the other way, and might have the effect, to some extent, of postponing the operation of the Act. That is not the intention of the Amendment, and I dare-say something could be done to prevent it having that effect. However, I am sure, if I have made it plain to the Secretary for Scotland that there is a real difficulty which I am trying to meet, he will no doubt be prepared to meet it, if it is possible to meet it at all. I move the Amendment in order to get a statement from the Secretary for Scotland.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MUNRO</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One sometimes finds in Committee that the intention and effect of an Amendment do not always coincide, and this seems to be a case in point, even on the confession of my hon. and gallant Friend. I think I appreciate the intention that he has in mind, but the effect of the Amendment would be, as he says, to postpone the benefit which this Act is designed to confer. In other words, the landlord would not get his increased rent until it was entered in the valuation roll. If the Corporation of Glasgow, let us say, did not get any benefit until next year neither could the landlord in the interval, and I am sure my hon. and gallant Friend, who does not represent Glasgow City, has no desire to bring about a result of that kind. Frankly, I cannot accept the Amendment, because it does not carry out what my hon. and gallant Friend desires. I can only repeat—I am sorry to have to do it so often—that I will look into this matter before the Report stage, and see whether the intention which has been ex-

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to move this Amendment at this hour of the day, but I cannot let the Bill pass to the Report stage without some slight discussion taking place on the period for which this Act is to continue. The period for which so pretentious and important an Act of this is to oppress us or to relieve us is of the most material effect. I have suggested in the Amendment that the period shall be reduced by one year—from three years to two years—and I hope it will be accepted, because if the Act is for three years, and it proves a failure, there is no possibility of getting rid of it. If, on the other hand, it is only for two years, and proves a success, it is a very simple thing to extend an Act of Parliament for another year or two years, or whatever time may be necessary, whereas to reduce it is prac-
	<span class='label label-info column'>324</span>
tically an impossibility. As there is always a possibility of the Act being a failure, as well as the hope of it being a success, I think for that reason two years should be inserted instead of three. But the main reasons I have for suggesting a shorter period are these. It is honestly believed by many persons that there will be a flood of litigation following on the passing of this Act. I believe every single tenancy in my constituency let this summer as furnished apartments will be liable to be re-opened under this Bill, and in that case the county courts could not deal with all the cases that might arise. There would be such a pressure of work that there would be an absolute dead-lock, and I do not know what would happen in the summer letting season. Rents have gone up very materially, furniture having gone up to the enormous price it has reached. My constituents feel that if the Bill goes through in its present form they would be oppressed by it. They feel that two years is quite a sufficient time during which a person should be able to get things at a great deal less than their value. There will be an immense amount of litigation under this Act which may cause it to break down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel very deeply on the housing question. I have always supported everything that has been put forward in connection with housing, but this Act would absolutely and completely stop any possibility of houses being built for a period of three years. I would very much rather that housing was stopped only for two years, and that at the end of two years we may get into the old way of doing things whereby builders, landowners, solicitors, building societies, and all the others concerned put their heads together and built houses by the thousand and tens of thousands as was done fifteen years ago. Building now will absolutely and entirely cease. There will be no more money available for mortgage on these buildings or to erect buildings as long as this Act is in force; and, therefore, I think it is a point of very material importance how long provisions of the character which come within the scope of this Act should be enforced in England. I hope the matter will be raised on the Report stage. I do not wish to delay the proceedings here to-night, but I could not let the opportunity pass, as nothing has been said on it during the

Committee stage. I merely raise the Amendment as a protest in order that the matter may be discussed on the Re-port stage, and in order that the subject should not be allowed to pass 	<i>sub silentio</i> here, which would be to the prejudice of those who wish to alter the period during which the Act shall continue in force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I think there is a great deal of evidence to prove that this is a proper thing to move. It has been quoted by the Minister and by those supporting the Bill that everything that was in the 1915 Act had the benefit of five years' test. This has also had five years' test, because it was in the 1915 Act. Therefore I think it should be put in to emphasise the point that it should be "and no longer."

Although I am an optimist, and always have been, on the solution of the housing problem, almost as much an optimist as is my hon. Friend opposite who shared some of the labours with me, I am afraid that I cannot say I think the housing shortage will be overcome in two years. Therefore I think the proposition contained in this Bill is a fair one, namely, that it should be a period of three years. I also want to say this. I have said it before in this Committee. It is my hon. Friend behind who started this suggestion about litigation under this Bill. I do not want Members to go away thinking that there will be a lot of litigation.

That is the kind of case which we have deliberately kept within the discretion of the Court.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the matter was discussed at such length before, it is sufficient for me to move this formally. The object of the Clause is that the Act shall apply to any premises used for business, trade, or professional purposes as it applies to a dwelling-house, and as though reference to "dwelling-house" and "dwelling" included references to any such premises. There are one or two reservations. Two of them apply to conditions in the Bill which affect furnished houses. It is perfectly plain that what we have in mind is, not large business establishments, but more particularly smaller shops and smaller business places in connection with which a tremendous amount of hardship has been experienced. I do not require at this hour to develop the argument, because, when the matter was discussed in Committee, most Members agreed that we should have had a substantial majority if we had pressed for a Division, and I think we shall have a majority now. It is of the greatest importance that we should seek to obtain this benefit for business and minor professional people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon.

I also made the point that anything we might fairly consider later would have to be limited in duration. That I do not see in the proposed Clause. In accordance with my pledge, I circulated a memorandum to the Cabinet in which I set out the discussion that we had in Committee. I said that I promised the Committee that the Cabinet would consider the matter in view of the discussion which had taken place. The</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Cabinet made a special appointment to consider this question, and it will be within the recollection of the Committee that I was absent one day about an hour. That was the Cabinet meeting at which this very memorandum was discussed. The Government also decided upon the terms of reference to the Select Committee on business premises, which I hope will be on the Order Paper this week. I understand that Members have to be suggested, and the usual negotiations, which, happily, I shall not be in charge of, as to who the Members shall be, may take time. The terms of reference are comprehensive and carry out our pledge in every way. My hon. Friend who moved the Amendment will be disappointed to learn that, although we discussed the matter again at great length, the Cabinet deliberately came to the conclusion, notwithstanding the feeling which had been manifested in the Committee, and notwithstanding that they fully recognised that a percentage of the smaller shopkeepers had been dealt with hardly, that, from the point of view of policy, it was the wrong way of dealing with it, and they reluctantly instructed me to report to the Committee that I was to adhere to what I had previously said and that the Government could not see their way to incorporate Clauses dealing with business premises in this Bill. I would only like to make one further observation. It ought not to be represented that we had not introduced a Bill covering the grievances of the vast bulk of smaller shopkeepers, because the vast majority live over the shop or in premises connected therewith, and they have been dealt with. We propose to press on vigorously with reference to the Select Committee with the full intention and purpose of dealing to the full extent with business premises, which have been such a long standing subject of discussion. We fully intend to do so, but I am sorry that, for the reasons that I previously gave, the Government have deliberately decided that they cannot accept this Amendment.</p>

It is a very important matter and I am not in a position to move any Amendment or to make any criticism, but it must be understood that I shall certainly examine it with great care between now and the Report stage. It may be necessary in consequence of that examination, apart from any general question of principle which is involved, which I will report to my colleagues, of course, to make various criticisms and Amendments on the Clause as it stands.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause has been given to me by a Member of the House and I approve of it, because I think that the sub-
	<span class='label label-info column'>334</span>
tenants have been the people who have been the difficulty very largely all the way through. There is no doubt that the tenants have let to lodgers—not lodgers in the ordinary sense—but they have let best part of their house and have only kept a very small portion for themselves. I think they should be penalised in some way so that this matter can be dealt with in a proper manner and that the landlord should get something towards the extra wear and tear. I know of my own knowledge of cases where houses with six or seven rooms have been let to five families where there is no authorisation whatever to let at all. I know of a case where a house was let at 10s. a week and where the tenant received by sub-letting 35s. a week. Therefore the profiteering has been very largely with tenants. I move this Clause because I think while it will probably not have a great deal of effect other than a deterrent, it will be a great deterrent upon tenants letting their houses out in rooms and in apartments which they are not authorised to do. At this late hour I am not going to detain the Committee longer but will move the Clause as handed in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that this Clause will have the following effect. If a tenant sub-lets any part of the premises without previous consent of the owner, 25 per cent. of the proceeds must go to the owner in respect of additional wear and tear. Two circumstances might arise. First, the tenant might be legally entitled to sub-let, in which case I am not sure that the owner has any claim at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have provided for that circumstance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The next thing is that the tenant might very improperly let, in which case my hon. Friend says, "Well, he is doing a wrong thing, but, at all events, the landlord shall have some share of the plunder." It can only mean either of those two things. The conditions under which a tenant may sub-let, the conditions applying to furnished lodgings and so forth, are set out in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P2I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>335</span>
Bill, and the procedure of the law must be to secure that those conditions are met. If any wrong or improper thing is done, the person ought to be dealt with accordingly by the process of law. There is no particular reason why any particular individual should benefit thereby. It is quite wrong that he should. I can see no justification for this. As long as the provisions of the Statute are obeyed, well and good. If they are not, the person should be dealt with according as the Statute prescribes and in no other way. No member of society is entitled as such either to be damaged or benefitted by anybody else's wrongdoing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not going to be a benefit to the landlord.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he get an extra 25 per cent., it is not a damage, anyhow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LORDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My Clause says: "If he sub-lets without the consent of the landlord." It is not with the consent of the landlord. It is an illegal thing, but you are up against this proposition—that you have given into the hands of the County Court Judge all your powers and the County Court Judge will not turn these people out. It is not desirable that they should be turned out in some instances. Therefore I think it is a reasonable Clause in that way. I do not for one moment suggest that where he has the consent of the landlord, or has obtained consent to the sub letting, that he should in any way part with some of the rent that he has obtained, but I do say, and I say it emphatically, that this sort of letting of houses means an enormous amount of wear and tear on
	<span class='label label-info column'>336</span>
the property, and it is only reasonable that he should make some contribution towards the repairs which he has created. It is not only repairs, but it is structural damage that has been done, and I think something should be done in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir A. YEO</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the face of it, this looks a very innocent looking thing, but if my hon. Friend had brought in an Amendment tackling the landlords who are dealing in flats, instead of those who are dealing in half houses and rooms, he might have aroused the sympathy of the Committee. I hope the Committee will reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
