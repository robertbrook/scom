	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed [	<i>16th March</i>]: "That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>Question again proposed.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The UNDER-SECRETARY of STATE for the HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. Oliver Stanley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we start the business may I take the opportunity of making a personal explanation? During the Debate yesterday, on an Amendment to Clause 29, I said, in answer to a question put by the hon. Member for Westhoughton (Mr. Rhys Davies), that I had received support for the Amendment from a deputation representing the municipal corporations. That was an error. I confused two deputations. The support to which I referred came, not from the Association of Municipal Corporations but from the County Councils Association. I thought it only right to correct that error in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RHYS DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I felt sure that the hon. Gentleman was stretching the point a little in supporting the London County Council, and I am glad that he has made this statement, because I feel more than ever sure that the London County Council ought not to be allowed to dominate the proceedings in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MANDER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I was not able to be present yesterday to move the Amendment to Clause 37, which stood in my name, and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Torquay (Mr. C. Williams) for so gallantly entering into the breach and moving that Amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>1294</span>
on my behalf. I am sorry that the Government did not see their way to accept that Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question "That the Clause stand part of the Bill," I do not think that we can go into matters which are not in the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MANDER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be in order for me to indicate why I think the Clause as it stands, is imperfect, and suggest how it might be improved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That would be going back on the decision of the Committee, taken yesterday, not to accept the hon. Member's Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RHYS DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing now with the question "That the Clause stand part of the Bill," and the Clause deals with the provision of remand homes by councils of counties and county boroughs. I do not know what your Ruling may be, Sir Samuel, on the point, but I shall be astonished if the Rules of Order prevent me saying that this Clause is inadequate to meet the purposes which the Government have in mind. The Under-Secretary has on several occasions, on this Clause, quoted in favour of his arguments the Report of the Departmental Committee on Young Offenders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never quoted it once on Clause 37.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At any rate, the hon. Gentleman has quoted it on other Clauses, and, may I put it gently to him, that whenever it suits his purpose, he quotes the recommendations of that committee. Strangely enough, he never quoted the recommendations of that committee on this Clause, because the departmental committee rather than agree to what this Clause proposes, suggested an alternative—not necessarily any addition to what is in the Clause, but an alternative to it. The committee suggested that instead of remand homes, there should be places where the children would be observed in the first place. They suggested that these remand homes might be turned into places where the children could be examined physically, medically and psychologically. I do not think I am going outside the Rules of Order when I express the hope, now that the Clause has practically been carried, against the wishes of the departmental
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0648">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1295</span>
committee, that the Home Office will use these remand homes to see that the children sent there are dealt with on the lines indicated in the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary knows full well that a considerable number of the children sent to these places are mentally unfit, and it is unfair to treat them as if they were mentally capable. The Home Office has a splendid staff in the children's branch and I want to pay a tribute to the work which they are doing. But the Home Office ought to go a step further. Before these children are sent to their final destinations for training and treatment, investigation ought to be made into their mental capacity, their inclinations and all that sort of thing. It is surprising what the departmental committee found out in relation to these matters. I went on behalf of that committee to Belgium, and found out what they did there. I do not care what name you give these institutions; you may call them observation centres, or remand homes, but we land in the same position in the end, and I do not think that, in the main, the children of one country differ from the chlidren of any other country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work done by the Belgian Government in connection with institutions of this sort is very interesting, and if the Committee will bear with me, I would like to refer to it. If this sort of thing can be done in a small country like Belgium, it can surely be done in our country which is very much richer, and I am conceited enough to think that we can do these things as well in our country as they can be done in any other country in the world. What I found in Belgium was that as a result of the special treatment given to these children, some of the lads—about 10 per cent.—are returned to their homes after a stay of a few months. About 10 per cent, were boarded out, about 4 per cent, sent to voluntary homes, about 52 per cent. stayed at school and about 21 per cent, went to other institutions. Even under this Clause, we do not seem to come down to the question of the analysis of the little chap's mind to find out what is to be done with him. We have altered the name from industrial school to approved school. We talk of remand homes, but in the end we do not regard
	<span class='label label-info column'>1296</span>
these children as separate individuals and as separate personalities. We deal with them in the main as groups, as a "lot of lads."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Home Office to use the powers which they will have under this Clause to conduct individual examination to these children, to ascertain the proclivities, the tendencies, the desires of each child, and to find out what can be done with that child to turn it into a better citizen. I went some time ago at the invitation of the London County Council to see what was being done with the children boarded out by that body, in Carmarthenshire. I had to make a report to the effect that the scheme was working very well. I do not know whether children are sent to any other part of the country, and whether they are treated as decently as the children in Carmarthenshire are treated, because we have a reputation in my country for dealing with children in a very humane manner. But that is by the way. I want the Under-Secretary to tell us whether it is the intention of the Home Office to make use of these remand homes, so that individual attention will be given to the children, to see that those who are not mentally up to standard are not retained there but are sent to the proper institutions for treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice, Sir Samuel, that you have had your eye on me, watching whether I would go out of order or not. But I am an old hand at this game and I think I have kept within the ambit of the rules of procedure. I happen to be a member of the Select Committee on Procedure, and I think I know just how far I can go, in dealing with a matter of this kind on the question which is before the Committee. Having said so much on the subject, I invite the Under-Secretary to tell us the intention of the Home Office in relation to the recommendations of the departmental committee. Although we have not put in words, such as "observation centres" and so forth, I think that within the scope of this Clause, there is still a possibility of carrying out some of the recommendations of the departmental committee in connection with the remand homes themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOVAT-FRASER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish strongly to enforce the remarks of the hon. Mem-

	<span class='label label-info column'>1297</span>
ber for Westhoughton (Mr. Rhys Davies) with regard to the inadequacy of this Clause. Many of us are profoundly disappointed that the Clause does not deal with this matter to which he has referred. It is now recognised by all who have given attention to the subject, that in order to deal with the child delinquency, there ought to be some system for the examination of children. Efforts ought to be made to find out how the child came to commit the offence with which it is charged, with a view to discovering the cause of the child's action and, dealing with the child, so that a repetition of the child's action is impossible. One of the greatest experts in this matter—I was going to say the greatest expert—is Mr. Cyril Burt, the psychologist of the London County Council. May I quote briefly some remarks of his, which bear out strongly the attitude taken up by the hon. Gentleman who has just spoken and myself? He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The psychologist is a detective. But what he seeks to detect are not persons but motives. The question he has to answer is not 'who committed this offence,' but 'what made the offender attempt it.'"</p></blockquote>
He is speaking, of course, of children. He goes on to say of the psychologist:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He learns that crime, like fever, is not a disease but a symptom. To punish the naughty child for his actions by scolding him, by whipping him, by locking him up under restraint, is like shutting a feverish patient in a chilly room in order to reduce his high temperature."</p></blockquote>
He goes on to stress the fact that it is very often lack of intelligence which causes criminal action in a child, and that the child is not responsible for lack of intelligence. Intelligence is born with a person or it is not. Mr. Burt says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the hereditary equipment of the youthful criminal, the most serious handicap is not lack of morals, but lack of intelligence. Among the juvenile delinquents in London as many as 80 per cent, are below the average level in general ability. The ordinary criminal when grown up, still shows the mental age of a boy of only 10 or 11. Most rogues are also fools."</p></blockquote>
In order to deal with the situation shadowed forth in these quotations, you must have a psychologist and places, call them clinics, or observation centres, or whatever you like, where childden can be examined in order that those who have to deal with them, may do so on wise lines. Children often suffer from obscure complaints which only careful examina-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1298</span>
tion can discover, and those obscure complaints lead them to commit offences. Mr. Alexander Paterson, one of the Prison Commissioners, speaking the other day, amused his audience by asking, "Why are so many burglars bow-legged?" He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"His theory was that bow legs and crime were closely allied because of their mutual origin in rickets. They were two different results of the same cause, which was to be found in the over-crowded homes of poor parents living in a neighbourhood where there were few playing fields."</p></blockquote>
That is the kind of thing that must be inquired into by experts and psychologists if the child's future is to be wisely dealt with. Not long ago I had a Press cutting of a case in which a woman, speaking to a magistrate about a girl who stole, said, "The girl cannot speak the truth, because she has adenoids." There was an immense amount of truth in that. That is the sort of thing that you have to investigate. There is a well-known judge in a children's court in America who begins with every child, in trying to discover why it committed an offence, by asking about its teeth. Teeth, he says, produce indigestion, indigestion produces bad temper, bad temper produces quarrelsome parents, and quarrelsome parents produce criminal offenders. We are far behind other countries in this matter; America has been doing wonderful work for years. Some of the American universities have rendered most valuable service in the matter—California and Colorado—and even universities in our own Empire, Sydney, for example, has been co-operating in this work of psychological examination. I consider this Clause really inadequate, and I hope even at this late hour that the stony heart of the Under-Secretary will be softened and that he will really do something to meet the very general expectation that this Bill will deal with the matter of which I have spoken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There might certainly be a misconception among listeners to this Debate as to what we are discussing. We are discussing whether Clause 37 shall stand part of the Bill, whether or no we shall have remand homes. As far as I can see, the two hon. Gentlemen who have spoken want remand homes and yet do not want the Clause to stand part. I do not propose to follow the hon. Member who spoke last in his long but in-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1299</span>
teresting progress from the tooth to the scaffold, hut I should like to refer to what I imagine the hon. Gentleman opposite, with his eye on the Chairman and with the love of procedure in his heart, must have meant, and that is that I should use the administrative powers which the Home Office has to control and regulate remand homes and to inv prove the facilities they give for medical and physical inspection. It is our object to do everything we can, in co-operation with the local authorities, to improve facilities such as those to which the hon. Gentleman referred. The fact that the Bill will mark the transference of these remand homes from the police authorities to the local authorities may well provide a new opportunity for co-operation and improvement. In one large town we already know of considerable improvements which are going to follow this change over, and we shall use these powers in co-operation with the local authorities to develop as far as is practicable the better inspection of which we speak. It is, I agree, an important factor in the right treatment of these cases, and it will have the sympathetic and close attention of the Home Office. The only result of supporting the two hon. Members who have spoken against the Clause would be, not to have better remand homes, but to have no remand homes at all, and in those circumstances I hope the Committee will allow the Clause to stand and enable us to use our administrative powers to improve the standard of remand home inspection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MANDER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has decided definitely against putting in statutory powers for separating children from young persons. Would the hon. Gentleman use these administrative powers to suggest, where it may be possible, in suitable cases, the separation to take place between these two classes? I believe it to be the experience of all those who have had to deal with matters of this kind that it is a matter of very real importance that they should be kept entirely separate and distinct, because you tend to get cases of adolescents boasting about their offences, particularly if they are sexual offences, and the younger children hear them and learn about a great many things which would not otherwise come to their knowledge.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1300</span>
I am not speaking without having obtained information from those who have personal experience of dealing with homes of this kind, in asking the hon. Gentleman to consider whether he cannot give some guidance and suggestion when the matter comes up to the authorities concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had it been possible for the hon. Member to be here yesterday, or had he been able to find time from his multifarious duties to read the Official Report of yesterday's Debate, he would have found that the appeal that he has made falls on ready ears and that already, in places of detention where the average number of inmates exceeds 10, we lay down rules for classification according to age and character and for separation of the different classes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BARCLAY-HARVEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the first Sub-section of the Clause is it perfectly plain that a borough can, if necessary, join with a county to establish remand homes? I am not certain whether it might not have the effect that one county may join another or one borough with another. I want to be sure that a county and a borough can join together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that is the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BERNAYS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise a point as to the accommodation in these remand homes. I understand that in many cases there are not more than two rooms. I hope the Under-Secretary will use these administrative powers to improve the general accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, we had an interesting Debate on the subject yesterday. It is true that in many remand homes there are no more than two rooms, but it is equally true that in many there are not even two inmates. There are a large number, for instance, which never have inmates at all in the course otf years, and it is impossible to provide large accommodation which one knows is not going to be used. We keep careful note of the inspection of the various homes, and, if ever we find they are not adequate in average accommodation, we naturally use our powers to improve them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CHARLES WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask one or two questions on this Clause. I want to know on what sort of basis these fines and imprisonments may be levied. I can quite understand that you may have an ordinary child who may happen to get away from one of these homes and if someone "puts him up" accidently, not much would happen. But we are dealing with both sexes and, if a case came up where a person made a habit of trying to get children away, it is conceivable that in certain circumstances two months might not be enough. I want to know if there are any further powers in the case of what I might call an habitual offender getting these people to escape. While we are dealing with the matter, it is not very likely that we shall have any kidnapping in this country but, in the event of our having any, has the Home Secretary power to deal with it? I imagine the law would cover it from other points of view, but the Committee ought to be sure that the Home Secretary has this further power if it is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt the Committee will be immensely reassured when I tell them that the law already has power to deal with kidnappers, whether they kidnap children from a private house or from an approved school. My hon. Friend made a point on Sub-section (4). I think his point was that we should deal lightly with people who accidently harbour a child, and heavily with those who knowingly do it. We cannot deal at all with anyone who accidentally harbours a child, because the covering words are that they should do it knowingly. With regards to the unlikely event of a man making a profession of assisting or inducing children or young persons to escape
	<span class='label label-info column'>1302</span>
from a remand home or of harbouring them when they have escaped, we feel that the penalties are adequate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>—(Evidence of orders.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 29, line 25, after the word "Act," to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or of an affiliation order referred to in any such order as aforesaid."</p></blockquote>
This is a mere matter of machinery. The Clause already provides that a true copy of a diverting order of an affiliation contribution shall be evidence of it. By this Amendment we extend that provision to the affiliation order on which the diverting order was based. As matters stand at the moment, it might be that an affiliation order had been made in one court and the diverting order in another, and it would be necessary to get from each court this certified true copy, although before the diverting order could have been made the affiliation order would have had to be produced in court. The Amendment will enable us to get one certified copy from one court where the diverting order was made, which, in order to make it at all, must have been satisfied that the affiliation order was in existence. It will make for convenience and the economical working of the machinery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>—(Appeals to quarter sessions under this Part of this Act.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TURTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 30, line 11, at the end, to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that if such court of summary jurisdiction is satisfied that the appellant is unable, through poverty, to pay the costs of an appeal the recognisance, or deposit, or other security shall not be conditioned as to the payment of such costs as may be awarded by the court of quarter sessions and the court of quarter sessions shall not order the appellant to pay costs."</p></blockquote>
The terms of the Clause are that an order made by the court of summary jurisdiction, which includes the juvenile court, may commit a child or young person to the care of a fit person, or send a child or young person to an approved
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1303</span>
school, or, 	<i>inter alia,</i> make other provisions, and in respect of these cases, the Sub-section ends up by stating that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the child or young person or his parent or guardian … or the person required to enter into a recognisance, or the person required to contribute, … may appeal against the order to quarter sessions."</p></blockquote>
At first sight it would appear that you are giving those children a right of appeal to quarter sessions. That is a right of great importance when the Committee realise that by Clause 14, we have taken away the right of a child to demand that he shall be tried by quarter sessions instead of by the justices in the court below. It may well be that a child has a legal argument to put forward and prefers to be tried by a full court of quarter sessions rather than by a juvenile court. By this Clause you have given the right of appeal to quarter sessions, but I wish the Committee to observe the restrictions put upon that appeal. The archaic provision of the law says that there is right of appeal to quarter sessions and that the appeal shall be made within the prescribed time,
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless it shall be provided in the prescribed manner that the appellant shall, within the prescribed time, enter into a recognisance before the court of summary jurisdiction with or without a surety or sureties, as the court may direct, to appear at the said sessions, and shall abide by the judgment of the court of appeal therein."</p></blockquote>
Any Member of this Committee would regard that as unjust. Obviously a man or child should be bound over to appear at the trial of his appeal at quarter sessions, but it goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and he shall be conditioned to pay such costs as may be awarded by the court of appeal, or the appellant may, if the court of summary jurisdiction decide, instead of entering into a recognisance, give such other security by a deposit of money or otherwise as the court shall deem sufficient."</p></blockquote>
It means, in all these cases, that not only is he bound over to appear at the court, but to be in a sufficient position to pay the costs of appeal. The court can, and usually does, make an appellant deposit a large sum of money in order to provide for the costs of the other side, should he fail in his appeal. I submit that that is a most unnecessary and unjust provision in the case of appeals by children from the juvenile court to the court of quarter sessions.

I regret very much that my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Dr. Peters) is not in his place. He said that he could not be present, but he told me of his experience last week, and assured me that I could intimate it to the Committee. He was appearing last week, in the role of solicitor, in the trial of three men before a court of summary jurisdiction, and at the end of the trial the men were found guilty. They wished to appeal. My hon. Friend made an application before the justices for such an appeal, and the justices said that they would demand, as security for the appeal, a sum of £210 in respect of those three men. He objected, and the justices reconsidered the matter, and in the end graciously allowed the men to appeal, if they would put down a deposit of £105—£35 each.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I believe—and I stand to be corrected—that the average is between £35 and £40 for each appeal, and that that is why you do not get the number of appeals to quarter sessions that you would get otherwise. The effect of the Amendment is that if a court of summary jurisdiction is satisfied that the appellant—in other words, the child, the parent or other person involved—is unable through poverty to pay the costs of an appeal, the recognisance or deposit or other security shall not be conditioned as to the payment of such costs as may be awarded by the court of quarter sessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not asking to take away the right to bind over a child or a parent to appear at quarter sessions, because that is a reasonable and fair provision in the law. But I regard as unreasonable and unfair the provision that a child should have to pay a deposit before it can get its appeal to quarter sessions, as a sort of guarantee of the costs spent by the other side in connection 'with the appeal. It may be said that these appeals will not be used a great deal. I do not believe that they can be. At the present moment there are, when one looks at the whole system,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0653">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1305</span>
few appeals to quarter sessions. It will be seen from the criminal statistics of 1928 that in that year there were 228 appeals to quarter sessions from courts of summary jurisdiction, and of those appeals only 100 cases failed. In 128 of the 228 cases the appeal succeeded either in part or in whole. You get injustice in all those courts of summary jurisdiction, and in this case it may be an injustice against the child or an injustice against a grown-up person in the matter of the contribution to the child or in the payment under an affiliation order. They are all cases where legal objections may well be taken, and cases where, if there is any possibility of appeal, real hardship can be occasioned to the appellant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I know what the Under-Secretary will say. He will say that it is wrong to make this change in the law merely as regards children. Against that I would say that surely we ought to start by giving justice to the children, and then perhaps if it succeeds we can go on and give greater justice in respect of appeals from courts of summary jurisdiction to quarter sessions. In these appeals you do not have the difficulty that you would have if you allowed the free right of appeal. Cases of bastardy orders will not arise here. It is only in cases of poverty connected with children that appeals will be allowed. The Committee will realise that I have not made the same provision in the Amendment as was made in the Amendment which I had the good fortune to introduce earlier, where the costs of counsel and solicitor's were paid out of the rates instead of by the appellant. In this case it is fair and right that there should be no mention of the brief fees for counsel or solicitor. I hope that we shall not be briefed in all these cases. There are a number of open courts where such applications can be heard. Appeals from juvenile courts should not be a matter of legal appeals, but more in the nature of applications, perhaps, to be taken before the court of quarter sessions when it has got through the rest of its business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Under-Secretary to consider the matter well before he turns down the Amendment. He might find it difficult to make a real reform of the whole system of appeals to quarter sessions. No one would meet with more respect from all branches of the law if he did away with the archaic provisions in regard to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1306</span>
security for costs. We are not dealing with rich people, but with poor children who cannot possibly put down £35, or even £5. In no case is the security for costs less than £5, and a child could not pay such a sum. Therefore, you are really denying the child the right of appeal which you attempt to give him in Clause 40. My hon. Friend the Member for Torquay (Mr. C. Williams) mentioned the question of kidnapping on the last Amendment. I hope that the Under-Secretary realises that in this country we have not Scarface and Al Capone infantile criminals lying in gaol awaiting their appeal. The persons who will be dealt with under a probation order and by the juvenile court will be the very poorest of the poor, who, if the Amendment is lost, will be denied the very elements of justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has moved the Amendment very clearly and sincerely. I do not want to deal with the mere drafting defect of the Amendment, which in itself would make it impossible for me to accept it. I wish, therefore, to say a few words upon the question of principle, and I shall end by asking the hon. Member to withdraw the Amendment. There is no doubt at all that the point which he raises with regard to quarter sessions and the expenses which have to be incurred and the security which has to be given before the appeal can be made is a matter of great substance, but I suggest that it is a question of general principle and not of a principle applicable to the Bill. In fact, one might almost say that the hardships which are imposed under Clause 40 of the Bill are certainly not greater, but are rather less, than the hardships which may well be imposed by a general application of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would, for instance, be manifestly unfair if you enabled, perhaps, a child to appeal without security against an order for supervision or of probation while the adult was unable to appeal without security against the sentence of imprisonment which not only deprived him of his liberty but which might well ruin his livelihood. I suggest, therefore, that this is not a principle which can be divided into the application to the child and young person, and the application to the adult, but is one which has to be dealt with as a single whole. The hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0654">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1307</span>
Member who moved the Amendment and who has for long taken a great interest in the subject and knows a great deal about it, realises, of course, that the question does not really partake of the simplicity with which he put it before the Committee. No doubt there are cases where great hardship is involved, owing to the insistence upon this security, but equally, on the other hand a policy of no security at all would, in view of the large number of really trivial cases dealt with by courts of summary jurisdiction, leave the way open to an absolute flood of appeals upon matters of trivial importance, and appeals for which the appellant would be unable to pay the costs and which, therefore, would not only choke up the judicial time of the appellant court, but would also involve a large expenditure upon the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not deny, as I have realised it to be so for some time, that there is a growing evil in the existing system. Sad cases are often brought to my notice, and when it has been suggested that the offender had a right of appeal one is met by the answer that it was impossible for him to provide the requisite security. I am authorised by the Home Secretary to tell this Committee that as soon as is practicable he intends to set up a committee to inquire not merely into the subject of the hon. Member's Amendment but into the whole question of appeals from decisions in courts of summary jurisdiction. Some steps towards the formation of such a committee were taken as far back as the Autumn of last year, but the crisis supervened, and delayed the completion of the work. Now, however, as soon as practicable, he will proceed with the appointment of a committee, to which will be referred the whole question of these appeals to quarter sessions. I am sure hon. Members will agree that this is a subject which ought to be treated as a whole and that it would be most inadvisable to take out this one small branch and deal with it without the investigation which such a committee will be able to make. In the circumstances I hope that the hon. Member will be prepared to withdraw his Amendment and allow the subject to be dealt with when the whole question is investigated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TURTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman tell me whether the committee will

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think it is quite fair of the hon. Member to suggest that there has been delay. Last September the appointment of the committee was definitely dropped, on account of the crisis which supervened and made a considerable difference to a number of things. He asks whether it will be appointed forthwith. I do not promise that we shall be able to announce the names of the committee this week or next week, but I do say we intend to proceed with the formation of it, and that we shall announce its appointment as soon as practicable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. C. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has made a most interesting and, if I may say so, a most important announcement. He has told us that the Government are about to set up a new committee. That will undoubtedly interest all the legal authorities. There is one further point on which I should like some information, and that is whether the committee will deal with the position in Scotland as well as in England. It would be unfair to leave Scotland out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I cannot go into questions of detail to-day. The point raised by the hon.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0655">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1309</span>
this is a committee which will be concerned solely with the position in England or will deal also with the position across the border.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may say in reply to that speech that I think the kind of speech attacking the National Government, made by certain Members in the House last night, does a very great deal more harm?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Amendment and the two following ones were set down originally in the name of my Noble Friend the Member for Down (Viscount Castlereagh). They were Amendments which I intended to accept, and as he is absent owing to illness I have put my name to them in order to be able to move them. They are more or less drafting Amendments, which are moved to meet the wishes of the Government of Northern Ireland. This Clause deals with the transfer of children and

	<span class='label label-info column'>1311</span>
young persons from schools in Northern Ireland to schools in this country. Hon. Members will see that we have referred to the schools in Northern Ireland by their present name of reformatory or industrial schools, but it is quite possible that in the future Northern Ireland will wish to introduce legislation similar to that which we are putting forward now, And may well change the name of industrial and reformatory schools to approved schools. If they were to do that and there were no longer in Northern Ireland schools known as reformatory or industrial schools this Clause would not apply. It is to meet that possibility that I move this Amendment, which will change "reformatory or industrial school "into" school under the law in force." It is merely a technical Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this Amendment be accepted Subsection (3) will read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The institutions to which this Part of this Act applies are homes and other institutions for the education, hoarding, care and maintenance of poor children."</p></blockquote>
I confess that on reflection I am not quite convinced of the necessity to put in this word, and if the hon. Gentleman gives
	<span class='label label-info column'>1312</span>
me an assurance that it is not necessary I will not press my Amendment to a Division. The point of the Amendment will be obvious to the Committee. There are all sorts of voluntary homes, some of which are highly commendable and others which are not commendable, and we are anxious that institutions which serve as voluntary homes under this Act shall be homes where ample educational facilities are provided. When dealing with children of this sort from the educational point of view one requires an institution which is sufficiently big to permit of classification, and an institution which is merely concerned with the care and maintenance of the children does not quite fill the Bill. Therefore, we are anxious to have an assurance—and that is the only purpose I have in my mind—that the educational facilities shall be ample.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has behind him in this Amendment the authority of the Child Adoption Committee, who in their draft clause, which we have largely imitated, included the world "education." I would point out, however, that the carrying of this Amendment would have an effect different from that which the hon. Member anticipates. It would mean that education would become one of the essentials before an institution was subject to this part of the Bill, and it would mean excluding from this part of the Bill, all institutions—and a number of them exist—which provide board and maintenance for children, and which either take in children so young that no provision is made for their education, or else send the children out to receive their education in an elementary school. That I am sure is not the intention of the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MORGAN JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about young persons above the education age?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member refers to both. He refers to the children as well, and, in that case, the Amendment would exclude such homes from the provisions of this part of the Bill. But there is a further objection to the Amendment. It seems to me to miss the point of principle. What we are trying to get at in this part of the Bill is some supervision of homes where children are badly treated or badly fed, or otherwise neg-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1313</span>
lected. What gives the opportunity for that neglect is not that they provide education; it is the fact that they provide lodging and maintenance. The opportunity for neglect and for these offences, is exactly the same, whether the children are receiving their education in the homes, or whether they are being sent out, provided that it is the institution, which gives them board, care and maintenance. It is really beside the purpose and would be beyond the power of the Home Secretary, in this connection, to see to the educational standards of these institutions. That is far more the concern of my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education. Our object is to see, in the words of Clause 46, that the child or young person in the institution "is not being neglected in a manner likely to be injurious to his health." For these purposes, I think it is not only unnecessary, but that it would be dangerous to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss HORSBRUGH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 33, line 18, at the end, to add the words "or endowments."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move this Amendment in order to bring to the Under-Secretary's notice the fact that there are many homes in the country which have endowments, but do not receive voluntary contributions. I realise that this Amendment might bring into these categories of homes, other educational institutions, and that it might be impossible to accept it. But I would like to ask the Under-Secretary whether he has considered the case of those homes which enjoy such endowments. Can any arrangement be made, if such homes are used, that they will be inspected in the same way as the other homes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment has behind it the support of logic. In theory there is no difference between the possibility of offences in a home which is supported by annual contributions, and the possibility of offences in a home which is supported by endowments. The sole reason for leaving out endowments is, as the hon. Lady herself has told the Committee, the difficulty of application. There is no doubt that the acceptance of the Amendment would bring under the Bill a large number of institutions of a type quite different from that which we
	<span class='label label-info column'>1314</span>
have in mind, the presence of which under this Clause would be not only unnecessary, but might be oppressive. In England for instance, it would certainly bring in such institutions as Christ's Hospital. It might, and probably would, bring in the foundation at Eton, and would cast a threatening gloom over some of the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge. On the other hand, we, certainly in England, have no knowledge of the type of home to which the hon. Lady refers, and in considering this Amendment previously I wondered whether this was not purely a Scottish point. The hon. Lady will notice that it is not necessary for an institution to be supported solely by voluntary contributions. If it receives an annual subscription, however small, the institution is brought under the provisions of Sub-section (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not been able to find any case in this country of the type which the hon. Lady wishes to include, which would escape owing to the fact that they receive no voluntary contributions. We see plainly the disadvantages involved in the acceptance of the Amendment, and at the moment we have no evidence of its advantages. I realise that there might be a case in which its advantages would be found to outweigh its disadvantages. But in the circumstances I hope the hon. Lady will not press the Amendment and if, between now and the Report stage, she can bring specific instances to my notice, which prove that there is real danger in omitting these institutions, we can always reconsider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOVAT-FRASER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Under-Secretary regard the term "voluntary contributions" as covering money obtained by the efforts of the children, in making things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The UNDER-SECRETARY of STATE for SCOTLAND (Mr. Skelton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene only to say that my attention was drawn to this Amendment with regard to Scotland. I asked for information as to whether there existed any homes which would be covered by it, and in the case of Scotland, as in the case of England, so far as I know, there are no homes which are supported only by endowments.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of this Amendment would be to make inspection not at the discretion of the Secretary of State, but obligatory.

Our first concern is to get a list and the necessary
	<span class='label label-info column'>1316</span>
particulars of these institutions, and Clause 45 will give us that power. We anticipate that when we have these particulars we shall find that quite a number of homes will not need periodical inspection at all. There will probably be another class, of which we shall be ignorant, and we shall have to inspect these, once or twice at the beginning. But it will then probably be safe to leave them without periodical inspection. I think the hon. Member can safely leave this matter to the discretion-of the Home Secretary.

We are anxious, however, to press upon the Home Office the desirability of having a complete register of these voluntary homes. In the main I think they are well conducted, but there are cases from time to time in which it is found that things are not properly done.

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. SHAW</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following what I have said already, on the subject of inspection, may I mention that I have had some experience in connection with local committees of visiting homes? As vice-chairman of a medical services committee, it was my duty to go along with the members of that committee to inspect homes. Never once had we reason to formulate complaints. Bather the reverse was the case, and instead of making the visit an annual visit, we turned it into a triennial visit. We found everything in splendid order. That arises out of what I have already said about my apprehensions as to whether the inspectorate is going to be increased. I should like an assurance from the Under-Secretary as to the amount which is going to be spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position at the moment is that we already have power of inspection, as we shall have under Clause 46. What we lack is first information as to the existence of these institutions, and, secondly, any power to deal with them after we have inspected them. It is a change in that respect and not any change in the power to inspect, which is being made by this part of the Bill. It follows, as we have already power to inspect, that we already have a staff of inspectors, and if the hon. Lady turns to the Financial Memorandum which is prefixed to the Bill, she will see that we do not estimate that this Clause will involve any addition to our staff of inspectors or that it will put any greater burden on the public purse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BARCLAY-HARVEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one question I should like to ask in connection with the wording of this part of the Bill. The words "Secretary of State" remain. In the main part of the Bill I think that it is the Home Secretary. Am I correct in inferring that this will automatically read "Secretary of State for Scotland" in the Scottish Bill or should some Amendment be made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1318</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As at present advised, when the Scottish Act is printed "Secretary of State" will mean Secretary of State for Scotland. In the majority of cases "Secretary of State" will be replaced by the words "Scottish Education Department." There may be cases where the words Secretary of State will remain in the Scottish Act, and I think there it will automatically mean Secretary of State for Scotland, but I will look into the matter arid see that it is made perfectly clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BRIANT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sub-section (4) provides that, where an order has been made for the removal of young persons, the institution shall not be used for their reception without the consent of the Home Secretary. I am afraid that a person who would conduct a home, probably for pecuniary ends, and has so abused his position that the home should be closed entirely, is the kind of person who would open another. I am anxious that an individual who has been guilty of gross neglect and abuse should not be allowed to start another home. It is not enough to close the home. I want to close down the person concerned. I have not put down any Amendment, but I am sure that the Under-Secretary will be in sympathy with my object, and perhaps he could suggest a way to help me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Member's point is met by the machinery of the Bill. If such a person wanted to open another home, it would be necessary to send particulars. The Home Office would immediately be aware that he was opening a new institution, and it would be possible by continual inspection either to see that the new institution was properly conducted or, if it was not, to close it. The mere fact that the persons would have to register immediately and, therefore, that the Home Office would immediately know that they were starting a new institution, would in itself be a sufficient deterrent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Amendment would raise the age of the employment of children from 12 to 14. We regard this as a very important matter, and we shall be very disappointed if we cannot make some headway to raise the age of employment beyond 12. It is an astonishing fact, in a country like ours, where every child must attend an elementary school up to 14 years of age, that we should be able to suggest in a Bill that children from 12 to 14 shall be employed in spite of the fact that they must also attend school. What we are doing in effect is to lend colour to the idea that from 12 to 14 children shall be employed somewhere under some sort of circumstances. There are committees of research workers who have made inquiries into the number of children employed between 14 and 18, and we have statistics telling us exactly what is their position under the law, but there is no law whatever outside industrial occupations to regulate their employment. So far as I am aware we have little or no information as to the employment of children under 14, and I do not know how it can be got. I am assured that school children are sometimes taken out in the holidays for potato picking and that sort of thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1320</span>
in spite of their opinions. I have been absolutely astonished to see myself disillusioned. But I had better leave that matter or I might say some strong things. We want it laid down that a child on holiday from school should not be employed for profit by anyone, and surely the argument grows every day when we know that there are children who ought to be at work from 14 upward, but cannot find it although, strangely enough, young children under 14 can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not mean that children on holidays should not be employed for profit?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not care whether the Noble Lady goes with me or not. Does she suggest that a child having a month's holiday from school should be allowed to work for profit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman had better ask his question through the Chair. If we ask questions across the Floor of the Committee we shall get into very serious trouble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: lit is wiser not to ask them sometimes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree entirely with the Noble Lady. What holiday is it for a child to be working? The law definitely states that you cannot employ a child in a factory or a workshop up to 14, even during school holidays. You cannot employ a child under 14 in a coalmine during school holidays. I have been a collier and a farm labourer, and I should prefer working in a mine under 14 to working on a farm. There is more liberty, to start with, and, of course, there is more money, and that would appeal to me, and it seems to appeal to a lot of other people as well. We have extended the average age of the individual by about 12 years in 50. The average age at death is 12 years longer than it was half a century ago. I claim, therefore, that the child is longer a child in 1931 than it was in 1900, and I do not

	<span class='label label-info column'>1321</span>
think we are entitled to take away the child life of these youngsters by putting them to work in potato fields in the school holidays. They get their holidays for playing purposes. Members of the Committee who are rich people do not allow their children to work at potato picking during holidays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Lady had better make a speech afterwards. I am afraid of getting into controversy across the Floor of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel very strongly on this subject. It is the children of the working classes who are taken to potato fields in their holidays, and I Object. The children of the rich can get three months holidays and go down the Mediterranean and to the South of France and then it is argued that working-class children shall go to the potato fields in their holidays. We do not allow these children to work in an industrial occupation of any kind under 14. I want to prevent unscrupulous employers engaging a child for two or three shillings in preference to paying five shillings to a child over 14. In spite of all that I have said, which may have irritated hon. Members, I appeal to the Committee to support the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss HORSBRUGH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee should direct its attention on this Amendment to the interference we are bound to have with the way a child should spend its holidays. I am very sorry that the subject of holidays has been brought into the discussion. There is a great deal of feeling in this Committee that the hours which any child should work while attending school must be restricted. We are supplying the education, and we must see to it that the child is able to take advantage of it, but if by this Bill we are to interfere with the way the child spends its holidays, we shall go too far. In a great many oases it is of benefit to a child to allow it to go and work in the country. It has been pointed out that we are legislating particularly for working-class children. In many cases people who, perhaps, are not classed by my hon. Friend in that way, wish that their children during the holidays had some work to do, and believe that their children would be happier for doing it. If the Amendment is inserted we shall
	<span class='label label-info column'>1322</span>
prevent children who might benefit in health, and no doubt enjoy their holidays muteh better, from going from some of the crowded districts in the towns to learn something about the country and engaging in occupations which would be good for them. They should have a perfect right to take up such occupations during the time given to them as a holiday from school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOGAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel very keenly in regard to children of 12 being employed at all, and I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Westhoughton (Mr. E. Davies) has mentioned industrial occupations. There are other reservations later on, in which I will take part, regarding other occupations which are not industrial, and where, I think, special facilities ought to be given to those who have certain abilities. I have some knowledge of the employment of children of 12 and even under that age. My hon. Friend has reminded the Committee that he worked in a mine, and I would remind the Committee also that I was out working at nine years of age and went on until I was 12 years, practically having to keep a family of brothers and sisters. This is a state of things in the labour market which ought not to be tolerated. We ought not to think of making old men and women of children, when we speak of the educational facilities offered to them. The present condition of many of our people is solely due to the fact that their childhood was dwarfed, that they were stunted in growth and made old men and women before their time. I desire to see the beauty of childhood, and smiling, happy faces, and not careworn children going about our streets like old men and women. Their life is a drudgery, and they go into school feeling weary. Hardly any brightness comes into their lives, and the holidays are the only occasions when children in the great industrial centres have an opportunity of enjoying God's sunshine and getting out into the open fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You should not give an opportunity to agricultural districts to manipulate the child life of industrial centres. To call it a holiday is an abuse of the term. Such a thing ought not to be tolerated. I am convinced that the Committee are sufficiently enlightened to understand that we should give pleasure to the child and make it understand its holiday, and not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0662">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1323</span>
cause it to continue its drab existence. We should see to it that the child is not engaged in the field of competition. I hope that) the Committee will accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the BOARD of EDUCATION (Mr. Ramsbotham)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment really is of great interest to education authorities, because it embraces about 1,000,000 children between the ages of 12 and 14. The Clause as it stands reproduces the existing law in the Education Act of 1921. I suggest to the Committee that before making any alteration in that law, of which we have had 10 years' experience, very considerable and weighty evidence would be required to justify such alteration. Although I appreciate the sincerity with which the hon. Member for Westhoughton (Mr. E. Davies) moved the Amendment, I think that evidence upon which to base his case was singularly lacking. Quite recently local authorities have had a 	<i>questionnaire</i> issued to them asking:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Does the experience gained in your area justify raising the present age of prohibition to 12 years, and, if so, what age?"</p></blockquote>
Seventy per cent, of those authorities said that there is no justification. In view of the opinion of education authorities, who, after all, have all the evidence before them and know the conditions under which the children work, it is a very difficult thing for a Committee of the House of Commons to fly in the face of the facts and adopt a view similar to that put forward by the hon. Member for Westhoughton. He can take comfort from the Bill, because it provides very considerable powers for the local authority by reason of by-laws. In Clause 49 (2), which reproduces the old Act, the local authority can prescribe the age below which children are not to be employed. In point of fact, I think that there are 13 local education authorities in the country which have raised the age of prohibition to 13 under the provisions existing in the Education Act. They can prohibit absolutely the employment of children in a specific occupation. I think that the powers in the hands of local education authorities are sufficient for the purpose that the hon. Member for Westhoughton has in mind. In any event, various local authorities have pointed out
	<span class='label label-info column'>1324</span>
—and, I think, with great truth—that at the present time and in the present conditions of distress, it would be a very serious step indeed to deprive families of the small earnings which this part-time and very strictly regulated part-time occupation of their children provides. In those circumstances I hope that the Committee will not accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Mover of the Amendment, that it really is dreadful that young children should be employed while they are attending school. It is a great pity. I was glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education state that local authorities had complete power, and that they would protect the children. I think that we should accept that assurance. Nobody in this Committee really wants to work children during school hours. It is a mistake. After all, who are working children during school hours? The hon. Gentleman made an attack upon millionaires. The millionaires are not working their children in school hours. It is the working men and women themselves who are working children in school hours. The hon. Member forgot that. I wish we could prevent such work. It is a great pity. But to prevent children from having the right to take employment during holidays is carrying the matter too far. Frankly, I would much prefer to see a boy of 13 take a light job than do nothing but try to amuse himself for 12 or 13 hours a day. The position is absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member who is so anxious to protect the children is not helping by exaggerating these things, much as I would like to see the age raised compulsorily. The attack upon some of the women who are deeply interested in children is very unfair. They may not represent the working class. I would divide the working class into two classes. Some working men and women would do anything rather than have their children work, while others would put them out on jobs. I am amazed and surprised that the hon. Member who moved the Amendment should have thought that any of us wanted to do anything that was unfair to the children of working men and women. I would not, either in this House or in any other place, advocate doing something in respect of a child which I would not do in respect of my own children. I feel strongly that during the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0663">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1325</span>
holidays parents should have the right, if their children wish to do any light job, to allow them to do so. Of course, they should not go into coal mines or be out for the whole day. That would be absurd and ridiculous. Nobody but a brute would favour that sort of thing. But if the children could go into the country and pick potatoes and do other light jobs they ought to be allowed to do so. Even when you have the very best to give, holidays are very long sometimes for parents, and many parents would be only too pleased that their children should have a job for a few hours a day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MANDER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This seems to be very largely a question of degree. Everybody seems to agree that there is some age at which no one should employ a child. That age is now 12, and it is 12 in the Bill. It is suggested that it should be 14. I, being a very much more moderate person, have put down an Amendment to raise the age to 13, and there is a great deal to be said for it. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education seemed to give considerable support to the raising of the age to 13, because he said that a number of authorities had, on their own motion, already raised it to 13. It seems to suggest that Parliament might appropriately come in and take another step forward, not to 14, but to the age of 13. The hon. Gentleman also used an argument that it is not a good thing to do it now when there is so much unemployment and distress about. Surely that is a very good reason for doing it now in order to take away from the labour market a small section, at any rate, of those who might otherwise be given employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not laid down anywhere that a child under 14 may not work. He may do so, and very properly, on a voluntary basis, in order to get fresh air and experience and all that sort of thing. That is the kind of work to which the people who have been referred to as millionaires—I do not know why—put their children. They are not paid for the work which they do, except in the way of pocket money. I cannot see that there is any real grievance in raising the age to 13, or any interference with the proper desire that children should be able to go out into the country and do some work. If you allow them to go out and work for wages you run a real risk of their
	<span class='label label-info column'>1326</span>
cutting into the standard of remuneration of others at a time when it is very difficult to get work. We know that agriculture and pursuits of that kind are among the worst paid in the country, and no loophole of any kind ought to be allowed for a reduction in the standard of remuneration by means of this kind. A case is definitely made out for a cautious advance, and while I cannot support the Amendment to raise the age to 14, I hope that the Under-Secretary may be able to indicate that he will raise it in a lesser degree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I understand the hon. Member for East Wolverhampton (Mr. Mander) he does not object to children working, but only objects to their being paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has thrown out an invitation for the age of 13 instead of 14 and has suggested that that age would be a considerable advantage to local authorities, who, after all, are to some extent the best judges on the question. That, as a matter of fact, is not so. There were only 19 local authorities out of 318 authorities who were prepared to recommend that the age should be raised to 13 and who were not prepared to recommend that it should be raised to 14. It is quite clear that the experience of local authorities as a whole is that this employment is not injurious, provided, of course, it is regulated, as it is regulated, either to the health or the education of the children. It seems to me that the Committee have now to decide whether they are really justified in depriving families in very poor circumstances of the few shillings which this work may bring in, and the children themselves of the extra benefits that those few shillings may mean in their home life, when they are not able to support their point of view by any argument that this employment is bad for their education or their health. I agree with the hon. Lady opposite that in view of the strict regulations which are enforced and in the absence of any evidence that it would be injurious to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0664">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1327</span>
the children it would be unwarrantable interference with family life to pass this Amendment. I believe that it would bring not good but harm to the children, by reducing the standard of their home life, and I hope the Committee will be prepared to reject the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am not concerned with the parents, I am not concerned with the community, not concerned with employers and not concerned with cheap labour—only with what is best for the child. We are, even at this time, still engaged in the century-long struggle which has been going on in the interests of children.

	<p>away, and our trade and our commerce would be ruined if those children ceased to work those intolerable hours. It is one of my happiest memories that I once saw Lord Shaftesbury—once saw him in the flesh—the man who did more perhaps than anybody else to fight the battle for children. We are still fighting the battle for the children. Like the hon. Member, I have always been a strong feminist. All my life I fought for giving women every right men possess, beginning with the vote at the University of Cambridge, but I am bound to confess that I have been rather disappointed with what I have seen in this Committee. After the vote on the age at which children were to be executed my illusions are beginning to fade. I emphatically support the Amendment, and hope the Committee will pass it.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain BROWNE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the part of the country from which I come there are thousands of small farmers and in the hay season one finds a whole family working in the fields—father and mother and perhaps three or four, or even five or six, children, ranging from a fairly young age up to the age of 12 or 14. If those children are not to be allowed to assist in gathering in the hay it cannot be got in and will be lost.

	<br><blockquote><p>"No child shall be employed on Saturdays or school holidays for more than three hours in any one day."</p></blockquote>
He has a similar Amendment to line 8 in page 36 of the Bill, and I think that his Amendment would come better in that place.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RHYS DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. In view of the fact that we are going to raise some very important points on the succeeding parts of the Clause, and as we have dope very well so far—I think the Government have done better than they ought to have done for some reasons, though not in connection with this Bill—I appeal to the Under-

Secretary to agree to the Committee adjourning mow. It would hardly be worth while beginning a Debate on these further Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STANLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is hardly worth while to begin with the consideration of this next Amendment if it is likely to be prolonged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Adjourned accordingly at Seven Minutes before One o'Clock until Thursday, 7th April, at 11 a.m.</p>
