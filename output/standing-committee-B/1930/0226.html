Clause 1.</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
—(Submission and approval of schemes.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p>(1) A scheme regulating the marketing of an agricultural product to which this Act applies by the producers thereof, or of any kind or variety of such a product by the producers of that kind or variety, may be submitted to the Minister by the persons specified in Part I of the First Schedule to this Act, and the Minister may, subject to the provisions of this section, approve the scheme.</p>
<p>(2) A scheme submitted and approved as aforesaid may be applicable to Great Britain or to any part thereof, and nothing in any scheme shall apply to any product, in so far as it is produced outside the area to which the scheme is applicable.</p>
<p>(3) Before approving a scheme, the Minister shall cause to be published, in the Gazette and in such other manner as he thinks best for informing persons affected, notice of the submission of the scheme, of the place where copies thereof may be inspected, and of the time within which, and the manner in which, representations with respect to the scheme may be made.</p>
<p>(4) The Minister, after considering any scheme duly submitted to him and any representations duly made with respect thereto and after holding such inquiries (if any) as he thinks fit, may make such modifications in the scheme as he thinks proper:
<br><blockquote><p>Provided that—
<ol>
<li>no scheme shall be modified so as to be applicable to any area to which it would not have been applicable without modification; and</li>
<li>before making any such modifications, the Minister shall give notice of the proposed modifications to the persons submitting the scheme, and if within three weeks after notice has been so given those persons notify the Minister that they desire to withdraw the scheme, the Minister shall take no further action under this section.</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
<p>(5) If the Minister,, after making such modifications (if any) as aforesaid, is satisfied that the scheme will conduce to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1122</span>
more efficient production and marketing of the regulated product, he may, after consultation with the Board of Trade, lay before each House of Parliament a draft of the scheme, and unless either House, before the expiration of a period of twenty days on which that House has sat next after the draft is laid before it, resolves that the scheme shall not be approved, the Minister may make an order approving the scheme in terms of the draft, and the scheme shall come into force on such date after the expiration of the said period as may be specified in the order, and the making of the order shall be conclusive evidence that the requirements of this Act have been complied with and that the order and the scheme approved thereby have been duly made and approved and are within the powers conferred by this Act.</p>
<p>(6) A scheme may be amended or revoked in accordance with the provisions of Part II of the First Schedule to this Act.</p>
<p>Amendment proposed [24th February], in Sub-section (1), to leave out the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"the persons specified in Part I of the First Schedule to this Act."</p></blockquote>
and to insert instead thereof the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"such producers."—[<i>Mr. Ormsby-Gore.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Clause."</p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount WOLMER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment has been quite rightly described by the Minister of Agriculture as a vital matter. We are asking that before these schemes, with their coercive character, are put into force, there shall be a clear and indisputably large majority of the farmers concerned in favour of them. We regard this as a matter of principle, and the Minister, to some extent, has conceded the principle, because on the last occasion he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I entirely agree that no scheme will work unless it has the good will, substantially, of the producers."</p></blockquote>
and he added—
<br><blockquote><p>"That is common sense."—[<i>Standing Committee B,</i> OFFICIAL REPORT, 24th February, 1931; Col. 1112.]</p></blockquote>
That is precisely our point of view. It is folly to make this great departure in agricultural marketing unless you can get a substantial majority of the farmers behind you. The objection of the Minister of Agriculture to the Amendment was purely mechanical. He said, "How can I ascertain that there are 75 per cent. of the farmers in favour of the scheme before there is a register of registered producers?" There is a good deal in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0558">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1123</span>
that. It is not merely a question of getting a list of the farmers who are actually producing the crop in question, but you have to separate that list into registered producers and exempted producers, and the classification of exempted producers will necessarily vary with every crop. If you are starting a marketing board for the hop crop, there would be no exempted producers at all, but if you are trying a potato marketing board there would have to be a large number of exemptions because no one would wish to bring in a man who is growing potatoes in his garden and selling them to his next door neighbour. You will be obliged to have a different sort of exemption for every sort of marketing board.<br><br>
The objection of the right hon. Gentleman, as far as it goes, is quite sound, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Ormsby-Gore) will have to meet it, if the Amendment is carried, by introducing words later to provide that these various lists are made out before the board was set up. That mechanical difficulty, although a real one, can easily be got over by some arrangement. But the Minister went on to tell us that he was anxious to meet the Committee on this point and had prepared a series of Amendments designed to ensure the end we have in view—namely, that no board should be set up unless there is a really big majority of farmers in favour of it. He asked us to consider the Amendments which he put upon the Paper. We have carefully considered those Amendments, and I am bound to say that in our view they do not meet the case. The Minister has offered us three proposals. The first is that when he lays the draft of a marketing scheme before Parliament he shall also furnish the evidence he has for thinking that the promoters of the scheme are substantially representative of the industry.<br><br>
With all respect to the Minister, what is there in that proposal? Does anyone suppose that when the right hon. Gentleman brings forward a scheme to Parliament, he would not give us his reasons for doing so? To state in a Bill that he has to furnish Parliament with his reasons is nothing at all, because he would be bound to do that in any case. We have not yet reached the stage when
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1124</span>
the right hon. Gentleman can order Parliament to carry out his decrees without condescending to give us his reasons. Therefore, that Amendment amounts to nothing at all. In his second Amendment, the right hon. Gentleman promises that there shall be an inquiry before he lays any scheme before Parliament, that is to say, that there shall be an inquiry if anyone objects to the scheme. That is a real point; and I should like to say that we welcome the announcement. But the point is that the inquiry must be an impartial inquiry, and I am sure that the Minister wants to have an impartial inquiry. I should like to put this point to the right hon. Gentleman, that in this matter he has already been bound to take sides. I do not blame him for that, but as he has espoused this policy and advocated it with all the eloquence and ability at his command, it necessarily takes him out of the ranks of the impartial people and puts him in the ranks of the protagonists. Few politicians can ever be regarded as impartial. He does not regard us as impartial, and we cannot regard him as impartial.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The MINISTER of AGRICULTURE (Dr. Addison)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should not conduct the inquiry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount WOLMER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, but the form of the right hon. Gentleman's proposal leaves the working of the inquiry entirely to the Minister. His proposal says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any inquiry under this Section shall be held in accordance with rules made by the Minister for the purpose, and those rules may contain provisions as to the costs of the inquiry."</p></blockquote>
And—
<br><blockquote><p>"where an objection has been duly made to the scheme by any person appearing to the Minister to be affected thereby and has not been withdrawn, the Minister, unless he considers the objection to be frivolous, or unless he has modified the scheme as required by the objection, shall, before taking any further action under this Section, direct a public inquiry to be held."</p></blockquote>
It is all left to the Minister, and. in our view that will not satisfy the farmers of the country. If he would provide that the inquiry shall be held by a person appointed by someone who is a recognised agricultural authority and not by a politician it would meet our case. It should be an authority quite clear of party politics and conversant with the needs of the agricultural interest.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0559">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1125</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not objecting in principle to what the Noble Lord is saying, but clearly this arbitrator must be appointed by someone, and if he is not to be appointed by the Minister who is to appoint him?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount WOLMER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman will look at the Order Paper he will see one or two suggestions as to how the arbitrator should be appointed. Our object is to secure that he shall be appointed by someone unconnected with party politics at all. Although we welcome his promise of an inquiry we are not entirely satisfied with the form in which he has provided for it to be held. His third proposal is to alter the word "may" into "shall" in Part II of the First Schedule. The Schedule lays it down that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister may, on the application of the board administering a scheme, by order revoke the scheme, if the board satisfy him that the revocation of the scheme is desired by more than half the registered producers."</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman proposes to make "may" into "shall." What is there in that? Can we conceive even the right hon. Gentleman wishing to continue a marketing board if more than half the registered producers satisfy him that it is not a success? We have too high a respect for his common sense to think that he would wish to continue a marketing board under such conditions. Therefore, with the best will in the world, we cannot regard the Amendments of the Minister of Agriculture as in any way meeting our demand that an ascertained and large majority of the registered producers shall be in favour of a scheme before these coercive provisions are put into effect. May I draw the attention of the Committee to the new Clause which has been put on the Order Paper by the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Viscount Lymington) and myself? It is to this effect:
<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to the provision hereinafter contained a scheme may provide for all or any of the following matters, that is to say:—
<ol>
<li>For requiring registered producers to sell the regulated product or any kind, variety, or grade thereof, or such quantity thereof or of any kind, variety, or grade thereof, as may from time to time be determined by the board, only to or through the agency of the board;</li>
<li>For empowering the board to regulate sales of the regulated product by any registered producer by determining for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1126</span>
such period as may he fixed by the board on the occasion of each determination—</li>
<ol>
<li>the kind, variety, or grade of the product which may be sold;</li>
<li>the price at, below, or above which the terms on which, and the persons to, or through the agency of whom, the product or any kind, variety, grade, or quantity thereof may be sold;</li></ol>
<li>For enabling the board to recover from every registered producer contributions to the fund established under Section five of such amounts as may be necessary for the operation of the scheme and for the winding up of the board, and for the assessment of the contributions of each producer in such manner as may be provided by the scheme;</li></ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Provided that every scheme including powers specified in this Section shall provide that such powers shall not be exercised by the board except at the desire (which shall be ascertained by poll in the manner hereinafter provided) of not less than seventy-five per cent. of the total number of the registered producers of the product concerned in the area to which the scheme is applicable and of persons who in the aggregate produce on the average not less than seventy-five per cent. of such product of all registered producers in such area. Such poll shall be conducted in accordance with regulations made by the board and approved by the arbitrator appointed under Section four."</p></blockquote>
The object of the proposed new Clause is to get over the mechanical difficulty which the Minister raised in answer to my right hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Ormsby-Gore) and I submit that it gets over that difficulty completely. The procedure suggested is that a scheme shall be approved by the Minister in the way proposed in the Bill; that it shall be laid before Parliament and approved by both Houses, and that it shall then come into force. Then all the producers will have to be either registered or exempted, but no interference with the business methods of the registered producers will take place unless they themselves, on a poll, by a majority of 75 per cent. of the producers and the product, declare that they wish to put into force the coercive parts of the Bill. That would give us what we are asking for, and would, I think, also give the Minister what he is asking for. It would enable the boards to be set up and the boards could then start on a voluntary basis. They could prepare their lists of producers and the registered producers would be separated from the exempted producers. They would be empowered to start marketing the pro-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0560">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1127</span>
duct just as co-operative societies have done in the past—just as the Scottish Milk Pool or English Hop-Growers Limited, have done. They could get grants from the Government and advances from the bank against the value of the crop; they could have their special mark and they could decide the manner in which their produce was to be graded and packed. They could buy manures and implements wholesale and allow their members to have those articles cheaply. In short, they could get into their stride.<br><br>
Furthermore—what is even more important—they would have several months in which to work out their compulsory marketing scheme in detail. They could put their proposal before their members who would have ample time to consider it. The members would know the personnel of the board. They would presumably have acquired confidence in the membership of the board, or else they would have changed it because the board would have been elected by the registered producers. Thus an agreed scheme, as it were, could be laid before the members of the marketing organisation and if 75 per cent. of the producers and the product were in favour of it, then the compulsory and coercive part of the scheme could be put into force. The Minister would lose nothing by such delay, but if he tries to hustle the farmers into compulsion he will fail hopelessly. Englishmen can be led, but they cannot be driven, and the right hon. Gentleman has to carry agricultural opinion with him in this matter. He would be well-advised to allow the boards to be set up on the quasi-voluntary basis that I have suggested, and not to attempt the compulsory part of the Measure until the farmers have become familiar with their own executives, and with the schemes, and have had time to make decisions.<br><br>
If the right hon. Gentleman cannot meet us to that extent he will be alienating a great number of farmers who are at present inclined to view favourably a large part of these proposals. We said on the Second Reading that we were prepared to agree to the principle of compulsion under proper safeguards, where it was a question of exercising compulsion on a small minority, and where the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1128</span>
question of foreign produce was dealt with. Of course the question of foreign produce does not arise on this Amendment but may I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman the position in which Members of Parliament who take an interest in agriculture may find themselves in relation to this matter 4 For instance, in my constituency there are hop-growers. If I were satisfied that the rights of the minority were adequately protected by an Amendment on the lines which I have indicated, I should be prepared to recommend the hop-growers in my constituency to go in for a marketing board because that is a protected industry and the question of foreign imports can be dealt with, but I should not be prepared to recommend them to go into a marketing scheme in which all these matters are left vague and in which they may find themselves coerced by a bare majority.<br><br>
If the right hon. Gentleman is unable to give a guarantee on the lines suggested he will find that the farmers will refuse to set up marketing boards. If, on the other hand, he can give some guarantee of the kind proposed by the hon. and gallant Gentleman for Montrose (Major-General Sir R. Hutchison), the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Stafford (Mr. Ormsby-Gore) and myself, he is far more likely to get the good will of the farmer. They would be prepared to come into schemes on a voluntary basis, and to face the question of compulsion fairly and squarely after schemes had been put in operation. I would remind the right hon. Gentleman that the National Farmers' Union, which has taken an active part against this Bill, is itself a great co-operative movement and stands for co-operation among farmers. Their sole objection to this Bill is its compulsory nature.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And the imports.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount WOLMER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is, of course, also the question of imports, but that question loses a great deal of its importance if the scheme is not compulsory because, then, producers need not alter their methods if they think that foreign competition would make it inadvisable to do so. If the right hon. Gentleman can give the farmers a guarantee that there will be no compulsion without a clear overwhelming
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0561">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1129</span>
majority of their colleagues it will make a great difference in their attitude towards this Measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In dealing with this very important part of the Bill, and the fundamental principle involved in it, the Minister has, I believe, endeavoured sincerely to meet our view. I believe that the right hon. Gentleman is not desirous that he should have an overwhelming volume of power as far as compulsion is concerned. I believe that he is genuinely anxious that the producers, in whose interest the Bill is being introduced, shall, as far as possible, conduct their own affairs. I think that the Minister has made an advance on this question and has submitted suggestions for meeting the serious difficulty which arises in regard to the point at which compulsion ought to be applied. In the various Amendments which we are now discussing generally, certain percentages are suggested and it happens that the Amendments put forward by hon. Members on these benches suggest a percentage which is higher than the others. But we are not tied to these figures; it is the principle about which we are concerned and we are desirous that some solution of this difficulty shall be found which is both just and practicable. I wish to see exactly how far the Minister has gone in order to deal with this difficulty. I realise that, in regard to many products, it would be difficult for the Minister to be tied down to a certain percentage in the initial stages of the scheme. I also realise, as we must all realise, that the producers' fears with regard to compulsion must be met. The producers on their part realise the Minister's power with regard to the amount of compulsion which may be applied.<br><br>
The words originally suggested in this connection were "substantially representative" but the Minister has put down certain Amendments to meet our views on this matter. The first of these Amendments is one to which the Noble Lord the Member for Aldershot (Viscount Wolmer) did not refer but which has an important bearing on the question. By that Amendment the Minister proposes to alter the wording of Sub-section (3) of Clause 1. As at present drafted that Sub-section provides for persons affected making representations with respect to a scheme.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1130</span>
The Minister proposes to substitute the word "objections" for "representations." I suggest that he is removing a provision which would have allowed helpful suggestions to be made, in regard to schemes and that in substituting the word "objections" he is not achieving exactly what he wants. We ought to consider who are likely to present these schemes, and where the initiative is likely to start. I think we may assume that the initiative will come from the reorganisation commissions in the first place. Probably they will draft model schemes.<br><br>
I can speak more particularly as regards the producers of fruit and potatoes, with whom I have been in close contact for many weeks, and, having regard to the present opinion among producers, I do not think that they will take the initiative unless some assistance is given to them. I think that it is the idea of the Minister that the reorganisation commission should confer with the producers in order that a scheme, meeting with the wishes of the producers should be presented. When a scheme has been presented, under the proposed new wording of this Subsection, it will only be possible to enter objections to the scheme, whereas if the word "representations" were left in, it would be open to those concerned to put forward suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am open to consider any wording. I only want the best word we can get.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very pleased to hear the Minister say so, and I suggest that it would be better to leave in the words "representations," and then all the producers affected by the scheme would be in the position of being able to suggest improvements, if any were desired, in the scheme which had been drafted. In the same Sub-section we find the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"Before approving a scheme the Minister shall cause to be published in the "Gazette" and in such other manner as he thinks best for informing persons affected—"</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister mean by "persons affected," merely producers, or does he mean all persons who will be affected by the operation of the scheme?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The latter, certainly.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0562">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1131</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear that, because it helps us considerably. If all the persons affected by a scheme are to be included, it will include the marketing side and the consumers. It is a good thing that the Minister has promised that, under certain conditions, a public inquiry shall be held before a scheme is passed, but he has suggested that this inquiry shall be held at his instigation and under rules that are submitted, and that the expense, or part of the expense, shall be borne by the producer who objects.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not correct. If objections are lodged, I shall have to hold an inquiry. It is not an inquiry at my instigation. My proposal is that I shall have to hold an inquiry, because there are objections.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the position will be that if objections are made, upon those representations being made an inquiry will be held.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now, I come to the crux of the Amendments under discussion, and I suggest to the Minister that, first of all, he must dispel the fears of the minority of producers who are going to be affected. There is tremendous fear among the minority that these coercive powers will be applied to a very large minority. The Minister is very anxious that that should not be so, but he sees a difficulty in fixing a definite standard by which he is to work. If he accepted an Amendment that we have put down, namely, that there shall be a public inquiry in regard to every scheme and that all persons affected shall be heard, provided that they make their representations in writing beforehand, that would safeguard his position and the position of the producers; and if we could have an impartial judgment in regard to the coercion of the minority, and a standard where the line shall be drawn and where coercion shall or shall not be applied, it would be very helpful. Will the Minister consider the advisability of accepting one of the Amendments to be moved either from these benches or from the benches above the Gangway, with the proviso that one of the instructions to the impartial person who is to conduct the inquiry shall be that he shall determine whether a certain percentage of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1132</span>
producers desire a particular scheme to be put into operation? Would the Minister, in order to relieve himself of a tremendous responsibility and a good deal of misunderstanding, allow this impartial inquiry to be the inquiry that then determines the amount of compulsion that shall be applied in regard to any scheme submitted?<br><br>
If we could work along those lines we should get what hon. Members above the Gangway desire, and what we desire on these benches. We should safeguard the minorities, we should help the Minister, and he would not become the autocrat that many people think he will become under this Bill. At the same time we should set up a standard by which the whole of the producers of the various commodities will know that an impartial inquiry will be held as to whether there is or there is not a genuine demand for a scheme. I hope the Minister will consider that suggestion very carefully, because if he could accept it it would help many of us out of a difficulty. We feel that we must stand firm on this point, that the Minister must not be given unlimited powers, and that he must not be in the position of an autocrat, even if he gives his reasons to Parliament why he believes that a substantial representation has been made. We believe that in this respect the Minister has too much power in the Bill. We believe that a line ought to be drawn for the guidance of the Minister. It would help all sections of the industry to work the scheme, create good will towards the Bill and promote the better marketing of produce, if we could know that an impartial inquiry would be held and that the decision of that inquiry would be binding upon the Minister.<br><br>
In his Amendment the Minister suggests that the report of the person making the inquiry should be made to him. Is he prepared to agree that that report shall be made public, in order that we may know exactly what has been the result of the impartial inquiry and what are the opinions of the person holding the inquiry, so that we may know the position before he lays the scheme before the House? If the Minister would agree to relieve himself of the responsibility of deciding when a minority ought to be coerced, and the substantial amount of majority that ought to be forthcoming before a scheme can be put
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0563">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1133</span>
into operation, and place that responsibility on to the shoulders of an independent person, he would materially remove our objections and facilitate the putting of his schemes into operation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel ASHLEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will give very careful consideration to the speeches of the Noble Lord the Member for Aldershot (Viscount Wolmer) and the hon. Member for Holland-with-Boston (Mr. Blindell). The decision that we have to give as to whether the number of people who favour a scheme is substantial, whether it should be 75 per cent. or 85 per cent. or any other percentage, will wreck or make the Bill a success. As the Minister said yesterday, and with great truth, this Bill is permissive, in the sense that it will not work unless a very large majority of producers in the area affected, by the scheme are in favour of it. If you have a substantial minority who will not come in, the whole thing will become waste paper. I do not know what may be the views of hon. Members of these benches as regards the general outlook, but I think that some such Measure as this is overdue. For the sake of agriculture, for the sake of the producers and for the sake of the country, some regulations for marketing are inevitable, and whatever party had been in power some Bill, not necessarily this Bill, would have had to be brought in. I agree with some of my hon. Friends that the Government are putting the cart before the horse, and that they ought to have regulated imports first. However, we must bend our energies to the making of a bad Bill into a good Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Make a good Bill into a better fill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel ASHLEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The principles of the Bill are good, but the machinery is rotten. I hope the Minister will not be pedantic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel ASHLEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He wants the scheme to work, and what I want is a scheme that will work, without a strong minority against it. If we have a strong minority against it, the whole thing will not function.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear!</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1134</span>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel ASHLEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Noble Lord, in a speech which we thought extremely clear and good, and upon which I congratulate him, put forward a practical alternative to the machinery in the Bill. He pointed out that certain machinery might be provided, so that the compulsory power should not come into operation at once, but that the voluntary part should function. Then, steps could be taken to ascertain whether a certain percentage were in favour of the scheme. I hope the Minister will favour that suggestion, or some such modification of the Bill. The hon. Member for Holland-with-Boston suggested that there should be an inquiry at the very beginning. I entirely agree with him on that point. There must be an inquiry, not so much from the point of view of the producers, because they may be able to look after themselves, but from the point of view of others who may be indirectly affected. You will mobilise all sorts of people against the Bill if you do not give them the right of inquiry, in order that their views may be listened to by the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel ASHLEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not addressing those particular remarks to the Minister. I was going to say that these people must be given the assurance that their views will be listened to by the Minister of the day, in order that he may be informed in regard to their views. The hon. Member for Holland-with-Boston went on to suggest that the officer who holds the inquiry should decide whether there is a substantial number of people against the scheme; whether it be 75 per cent. in favour, or whatever the percentage may be. On that suggestion, I part company from him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point was not that the officer conducting the inquiry should decide whether there was a substantial representation. My point was that we should fix a definite percentage and that when we had fixed a definite percentage the officer holding the inquiry should be the person to determine whether that percentage had or not been reached. [HON. MEMBERS "That was not what you said!"] That was what I intended to say.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Colonel ASHLEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must be responsible to Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel ASHLEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Therefore, the Minister must have the final decision. Let the inquiring officer report to the Minister his views in regard to the percentage, but the responsibility, from the Parliamentary point of view, must always rest with the Minister, and he can then be held responsible by Parliament. May I implore the Minister to meet us as far as possible?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel ASHLEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to kill the Bill. I want to make it a good Bill. I think there is a great deal of good will on this side towards the Bill. We want to make it a really useful Measure, to co-ordinate energies, to help the co-operative system, and to assist the farmer, and if we go into proper details and put in proper safeguards I do not think that the minority who are coerced, and who will have to be coerced, will have any legitimate cause for objection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel LANE FOX</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee are in the happy position of agreeing as to the principle, but on our success in finding the right words and the right system under which to work this part of the Bill depends the success of the Bill, and we must satisfy the producers that they are having a fair deal before we can expect them to take part in what we want them to do. Will it be possible in this discussion to refer to a certain extent to the later proposed new Clause which the Noble Lord, the Member for Aldershot (Viscount Wolmer), has mentioned as an alternative to the present proposal? If we can discuss it without going outside the rules of order, it will be easier for the Minister to reply and to contrast the two suggestions. The suggestion of the hon. Gentleman below me would not sufficiently satisfy the producer, because the mere fact of having an impartial inquiry would have the effect we want. We want to gain a psychological effect, to win the confidence of the producers, and to make it plain to them that we have confidence in them. An independent inquiry would not give them sufficient satisfaction and remove their objections to the idea that they are to be coerced.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1136</span>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The proposed new Clause touches matters under discussion, and we had better have a general discussion now on the whole question. We can, if an agreement is not reached, take a Division on the proposed Clause without having a second discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir JOSEPH LAMB</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A great deal has been said about the importance of the percentage to be adopted in the Bill in order to get a good working majority of those in favour of any scheme. I agree with the importance of the percentage, whether it be a percentage of individuals, or a percentage of the produce which will be represented in the scheme. If we had a percentage of the individuals only, it would perhaps deal unfairly with a small minority of people who were the producers of the greater part of the product. It is, therefore, essential that a percentage scheme should be adopted for both the individual and for the produce. I am much more concerned as to whether the vote taken is a well-informed vote. It is not a question of the number of people voting, but the question whether those who vote really understand what they are voting about. The question of when, and how, the vote is taken is also important. I presume that under the suggestion of the right hon. Gentleman on this side of the Committee, a scheme would come before Parliament and be approved by Parliament before the vote is taken. In that case, we should be certain that those taking part in the poll would have a substantial opportunity of knowing exactly what they were voting about. Some people, out of sheer apprehension against something they fear, might vote against something which would really be to their advantage. Consequently, it is much more important, when the vote is taken, that it should be a well-informed vote, than that too much regard should be had to the percentage. I hope that that aspect of the case will be seriously considered by the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major-General Sir ROBERT HUTCHISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first thing that strikes me is that the question of how far we are justified in forcing a minority into a scheme which they may not want depends on the size of the minority. The wording of the Bill, which will ultimately become an Act of Parliament, must be our care, because afterwards, whoever
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0565">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1137</span>
administers the Measure will have to be guided entirely by what is laid down in the four walls of the Act. No remarks made by the Minister will bind a future Minister. Therefore we have to be careful that what we do is not unjust to a large section of the agricultural community. In the Bill the words used are "substantial representation." I can conceive a Minister thinking that substantial representation comes from a minority of the producers. Suppose that a small body of experienced and large producers give a view to the Minister, he might say that, as regards their particular product, that was substantial representation. At any rate, it can be conceived like that, and I ask the Minister whether by "substantial representation" he means "substantial majority"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, as far as you know what a majority is. You cannot tell a precise majority, because at that stage of the proceedings you would not know what the total number was. You could only do the best possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. HUTCHISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That leads me along the line of argument that I am pursuing, that it is quite possible for substantial representation, in the mind of the Minister, actually to be put forward by a minority of the producers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would not be possible. You must have regard both to the number and quantity, and the Scottish returns and ourselves would be a sufficient guide to that. We know near enough the number and quantity. It cannot be done by a minority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. HUTCHISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are driven to the position that we must undoubtedly look after that large section that will not agree with the representations, made. Whether it be a majority percentage or the quantity of the produce, or of the number of producers, you might have a minority of the producers with a majority of the production. That would possibly be a good reason for the Minister accepting that as representing substantial representation, but you would have to convince a great many individuals that such action by the Minister was justified. That is why in our Amendment we put down a double-barrelled safeguard, one dealing with producers
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1138</span>
and the other with production. I suggest to the Minister that, having agreed that "substantial representation" means "substantial majority," it would be a good thing if he could define exactly what "substantial majority" means. Does he mean 1 per cent. or 10 per cent. over and above the half-way line? Does he mean 60 per cent. of the producers?<br><br>
Later in the Bill the Minister says that 50 per cent. of those producing can apply to have a scheme non-operative. If he lays it down for the one side, it is reasonable to lay down some definition for the other side. At our last meeting I asked the Minister if he could not apply the percentage to those coming into the scheme as well as to those who want to go out of the scheme, and he replied that he had no means whereby he could know exactly the number of people who were producers. I made the remark, and I do not know whether the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will refute it, that we have a very goad guide in the amount of produce in the various agricultural returns. I realise that the agricultural returns are not accurate as to quantity, but they are certainly accurate as to acreage under production—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The UNDER-SECRETARY of STATE for SCOTLAND (Mr. Johnston)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Over an acre.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. HUTCHISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Therefore, we have data on which to work if the Minister wants to apply some form of percentage of the majority. I am satisfied that something of this nature will have to be introduced into the Bill before we can really satisfy the minority who do not want to come in. The Hop Board broke down on a minority of 10 per cent., and I can conceive that it would be justifiable to coerce and make binding a scheme with 25 per cent. objecting, but when we get to larger numbers, it is a serious matter and a departure from freedom of trade which is almost unique in our legislation. I realise that some form of compulsion is necessary to make these schemes a success, but in the amount of that compulsion it is vital that there should be some clearing up of this rather loose phraseology. Our party, from their peculiar position, are rather sensitive to minorities, and some of my Friends do not agree with the percentage. If we cannot have a percentage, we must have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0566">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1139</span>
some other way of defining what is really meant.<br><br>
With reference to the question of inquiry, we feel that there ought to be an inquiry into every scheme, no matter whether there is representation against it or not. In other words, once a scheme has been prepared, the Minister ought to set up an inquiry to gather information as to whether there is an objection or not, because there are always difficulties in the agricultural community with regard to the writing of letters to the Minister. If nobody comes forward, that will be an end of it, but it will safeguard those in the industry, who are not as well educated as others, in putting up objections. That is the view of many of our Members here, and I hope that the question of holding an inquiry, which will be useful for finding whether a scheme is approved by a substantial majority, will be considered. I hope, too, that the Minister will do something to clarify the loose statement in the Bill, because a large number of agriculturists are alarmed that they will be compelled to come into something which will not be to their advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is substantial agreement in the Committee that before any scheme is put into operation there should be adequate guarantees and that it represents the desires of a substantial majority of the producers of the regulated product.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. HUTOHISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A substantial majority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will come to the question as to how we should decide the majority in a moment. If we are agreed on the general principle, then the question arises as to whether or not we should in the Bill specify a figure as a majority of members of the producers or of the regulated product. I think hon. Members opposite are beginning to appreciate the enormous practical difficulties which will arise whenever an attempt is made to put a figure in the Bill, and I am going to try to add to their difficulties in a moment. In the first place, there is the question: what is the number of the producers of the product. Nobody knows, and you cannot ascertain the number. There are small producers of potatoes who are not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1140</span>
in our returns. Then there is the question of the product. It varies. Milk, for example, varies from month to month, from season to season; and it may be that 75 per cent. of the potatoes produced in 1930 may be 60 per cent, of the potatoes produced in 1931. Whenever we come to give a figure we are faced with a mass of practical difficulties which must be seriously considered. A scheme for 1932 must be begun by December, 1931; and who is to say what will be the percentage of the products, the requisite percentage of the product, for next year's crop; who, indeed, would be able to say the percentage of producers of the product of next year's crop?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. HUTCHISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely you get a percentage of the last year's crop.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But see how obviously unfair that might be. We are trying to meet a practical difficulty. We are all agreed upon the principle, and I am putting the point of the extreme difficulty of ascertaining what would be the requisite basis upon which to get our figure for next year's crop. The hon. and gallant Member says there is last year's figure. How obviously unfair that may be to a majority or minority of the producers of next year's crop; and if the hon. and gallant Member will consider the point he will realise how readily such a suggestion might land a majority or a minority in legal actions. The Noble Lord the Member for Aldershot (Viscount Wolmer) has made the suggestion, which has something to be said for it, that we might arrive at a solution if we take a "substantial majority" after a constituency has been secured; after we have eliminated the producer-retailer who is going to be exempted under the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel ACLAND-TROYTE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The hon. and gallant Member may take it from me that there is a provision in the Bill to exempt that class of people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir HENRY CAUTLEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Under-Secretary tell us where it is in the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is in the provision for exemptions. I am dealing with the question of the constituency upon
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0567">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1141</span>
which it might be advisable to secure a definition of the words "substantial majority," and I am saying that it might be desirable to accept as a basis that constituency after the constituency has been purged of people who would normally be exempted in any case, Whether they be producer-retailers, the small producer-retailers or people with only an acre in extent, or people growing potatoes in their back gardens. After you have eliminated these innumerable producers you have only the substantial producers of a commodity for market who would be directly affected by the scheme. It is a question for consideration as to whether this should be the constituency upon which you should base your percentage of the numbers of producers or the regulated product.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BARNES</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will you ascertain that constituency before the draft Order is submitted to Parliament?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously that is impossible. We can thrash out all these minor details afterwards. I am seeking, with some difficulty, to meet the one point under discussion, as to whether or not there should be in the Bill a figure of 80 per cent., or 85 per cent., or 75 per cent., of the producers of the product or the quantity of the product, and I am submitting that it is impossible for us with our limited knowledge of the total number of producers, and the number who would be exempted, to put any figure into the Bill at all with any hope of success. Whether you should put a figure in the Bill or leave the words "substantial representation," or whether it may be possible to put in a figure with some safeguards, is a matter for consideration. May I put this point, that when you are considering your percentages you have to consider the number of producers from whom it is difficult to get a vote? There is the farmer who is in the last year of his tenancy, and there is a farmer, in Scotland, who is in a trust estate, that is where the bank does the voting for him and, unfortunately, there are a large number of them in Scotland.<br><br>
The point is that whenever you decide upon a figure you are going to make it difficult for the majority or the minority to prove their case. In answer to the hon. and gallant Member for Montrose
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1142</span>
(Sir R. Hutchison) it is true that the Farmers' Union in England have taken a rather different attitude towards the essential principle of the Bill from that taken by the National Farmers' Union in Scotland, but I know that the Farmers' Union in Scotland have had this Bill under close examination, and without putting it too high I can say that, subject to some disagreement about Subsection (2) of this Clause, they are in complete agreement with Clause 1 of the Bill. That is a remarkable thing, and it shows the trend of public opinion in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What percentage of the farming community does the National Farmers' Union in Scotland represent?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say, but I will get the hon. Member the figures. It is recognised as the general organisation and speaks for the farming community in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. DALLAS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They represent 70 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a remarkable figure, and they have accepted the essential principle in Clause 1, subject to the qualification that I have indicated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. R. W. SMITH</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may be 70 per cent. of the farmers of Scotland who are members of the National Farmers' Union, but I do not think it can be said that 70 per cent, of the farmers approve of the policy of the Farmers' Union.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is the strongest argument that can be brought against the point I am making I am content to leave it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. DALLAS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The same thing applies to the English Farmers' Union. Whilst a majority are against, there is a minority in favour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought it was so self-evident that it was hardly worth mentioning, but if it will please the hon. Member for Aberdeen Central (Mr. R. W. Smith) I will say that I believe that the National Farmers' Union in. Scotland does not speak for 100 per cent. of its members, neither does the English Farmers' Union. I am sorry that the point I was making has been rather side-tracked by what is really an irrelevant issue. The sole
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0568">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1143</span>
difficulty I have about the matter is in putting in a figure. The general attitude is to provide safeguards to ensure that it is only a substantial majority of the producers or the product that has to be regulated, that shall be included in the scheme—I am perfectly certain that that is the attitude of the Minister—but I do not think you can do it by putting in a figure or can possibly get it until you have purged your electoral roll of the large number of producers who will not be coming in in any case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. HUTCHISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to get at what is in the mind of the Minister. Suppose for a moment that the numbers of those producing could be ascertained, what would the right hon. Gentleman consider a substantial majority? Is it 60 per cent. or 70 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have one or two statements to make later on and I will take a note of what the hon. and gallant Member has said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel ACLAND-TROYTE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for the New Forest (Colonel Ashley) said that we could make a bad Bill into a good one. I do not think that it is possible to make this Bill into a good one, but we may be able to make it a better Bill than it is now. The vast majority of agriculturists are opposed to the Bill. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland has spoken of the Scottish Farmers' Union, but the Scottish Chamber of Agriculture is opposed to the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By a majority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel ACLAND-TROYTE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and the Farmers' Union in England are opposed to it by a majority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not substantial.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel ACLAND-TROYTE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I have received a single representation in favour of the Bill, but I have received many against it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. DALLAS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the point arises, and I must ask hon. Members not to be diverted from the subject before the Committee.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1144</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel ACLAND-TROYTE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland suggested that some of the difficulties in connection with this matter of the percentages have been removed. I suggest that these difficulties could very largely be removed, and many of our objections to the Bill could be met by taking out of it altogether any question of compulsion. My main objection to the Bill is the large amount of compulsion which could be exercised under it on those who are unwilling to come into these schemes, and if that element were removed from the Bill its passage would be very much easier. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland said that the producer-retailer was exempt, but there is nothing in the Bill providing for such exemption. I have put down an Amendment which would have the effect of giving such power of exemption and, after what has been said by the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, I hope that my Amendment will be accepted.<br><br>
I submit that it is absolutely necessary to include some percentage in the Bill. If the Minister accepts the new Clause in the name of the hon. Member for Aldershot (Viscount Wolmer), it may not be necessary to press the Amendments which we have put down to Clause 1 dealing with this matter, but if the Minister does not accept that new Clause, it will be necessary to press these Amendments. I should be prepared to support the Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Holland-with-Boston (Mr. Blindell) on certain conditions. It does not carry out what I wish to see carried out, but I should be prepared to agree to it with the addition of the proviso in the next Amendment on the Paper which stands in my name. The Amendment of the hon. Member proposes that any organisation must satisfy the Minister that they represent 85 per cent. of the persons concerned, but that does not ensure a majority. An organisation might put forward a scheme by a bare majority of that 85 per cent., with the result that only 43 per cent. of the total number of producers in the area would be in favour of it, and that 43 per cent. would be able to force their scheme on the remaining 57 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am using the word "organisation" in its broadest sense.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0569">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1145</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut-Colonel ACLAND-TROYTE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be so, but I suggest that in order to safeguard what I believe both the hon. Member and I have in mind, it will be necessary to put in the proviso such as that suggested in my Amendment to the effect that the Minister shall not approve of any scheme unless he is satisfied that 75 per cent. of the producers in the area are in favour of the scheme. I hope that some such proviso will be inserted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major MUIRHEAD</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to associate myself with the remarks of my right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for the New Forest (Colonel Ashley) who said that he was not unsympathetic to the general tenor of the Bill. That is certainly my point of view. No one suggests that the Bill is popular, but I, for one, am perfectly willing to consider it on its own merits. In what I have said and written upon it I have probably laid myself open to be shot at and in fact, in private conversations with some of my constituents, I have been shot at. I do not grumble at that, but I am not prepared to fill the role of a little Saint Sebastian in defence of a Bill which is neither what I want, nor what the Minister wants. There are two kinds of compulsion, namely, enabling compulsion and Ministerial compulsion and I find that various forms of Ministerial compulsion are so prominent in this Bill that they seem entirely to swamp what ought to be fundamental in the Bill, namely, enabling compulsion. Unless the Minister does something at the very beginning, to put right this matter as to "substantial representation" he will find that the Bill will continue to be misrepresented throughout the country.<br><br>
The Noble Lord the Member for Aldershot (Viscount Wolmer) with whose remarks I entirely associate myself, made use of the phrase "mechanical difficulty" and surely that phrase exactly describes the present difficulty. I do not think I am wrong in saying that what the Minister wants to do is to get some scheme started, and he is afraid that if we tie him down on this question of percentages, the scheme never will be started. If I may continue the mechanical analogy, the Minister sees in this scheme, as it were, a great motor car full of potential energy and capable of doing great things, and he wants to ensure that he will have the right to push the button
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1146</span>
of the self-starter. Let us concede him that right. Let him start the engine and let us adopt, at the same time, the Noble Lord's suggestion that when it comes to letting in the clutch, that matter shall be in the hands of a very definite percentage of the producers. Then everybody will be satisfied—the Minister will have started the engine while a substantial majority of the producers will have let in the clutch.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary for Scotland, I think, rather laboured the point as to the difficulty of ascertaining exactly and with complete fairness a majority or minority of the producers, because the figures at this moment would not correspond with the figures of the previous year. Surely we meet that difficulty in all sorts of other matters. I am taxed, not on my income at this moment, but on my income at some bygone day. I grumble, but that is not considered an insuperable difficulty in the way of the collection of the tax. Some of us are elected to Parliament on registers which are a little out-of-date, but that is no reason for saying that it is impossible to compile any register at all. It is impossible to get perfection in these matters. If we choose a definite percentage it will have imperfections, but, at the same time, it will give a feeling of security and certainty to the large body of people who are affected. What may be lost in logical perfection will, I am sure, be gained in the sentimental value of the feeling of security and certainty given to those concerned. I should like to impress one thing on the Minister. This question of safeguards, of Ministerial interference is not, in my opinion, nor I think in the opinion of others like myself who are generally sympathetic with the Bill, a question merely of making the Bill better or worse. It is the whole question of whether we can support this Bill and try to make it a better Bill, or whether we feel fundamentally, that we have to oppose the Bill <i>in tote</i> because it has certain objectionable features which vitiate it entirely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major COLFOX</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland started his speech with what was to me the very encouraging statement that it would be necessary to have a poll before arriving at a definite percentage. To use his own expression, it would be necessary, for the purposes of definite ascertainment in this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0570">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1147</span>
matter, to form a constituency. But while making that encouraging statement the hon. Gentleman did not complete the argument or disclose the intentions of the Government. He did not tell us whether or not the Government favour the new Clause which stands in the name of the hon. Member for Aldershot (Viscount Wolmer). The truth, of course, is that if any scheme is to work it is absolutely necessary that it should have behind it the good will of the producers. No substantial minority must be coerced.<br><br>
It is possible to ascertain the views of the producers at two stages in these proceedings, one before the schemes are produced, and the other before the schemes are laid before Parliament. The first procedure entails considerable difficulties and is almost unworkable because at that stage you have not formed your constituency, and you would, furthermore, be asking the producers to vote for a nebulous idea, with no definite scheme or plan before them. A vote taken at that stage would be of little advantage as showing the views of the majority and minority of the producers. Alternatively the views of the producers could be ascertained after the scheme had been produced, and worked out in detail, and put before the Minister, and, by him, laid before Parliament. At that stage you would have formed a definite constituency. You would have a register of producers and you would be able to present to the producers a cut-and-dried scheme which they would be able to judge.<br><br>
It seems to me that we are discussing the question of percentages and polls at the wrong stage of this Bill. If the representatives of the Government would give the Committee a definite undertaking that the Government support the principle of the new Clause in the name of the Noble Lord the Member for Aldershot (Viscount Wolmer), it would very much shorten the discussion, because the series of Amendments that we are now discussing would be unnecessary. If the Government are unable to give us that assurance, I feel that, although this group of Amendments do not fully carry out the object which we have in view, they do go some way towards that and, on the principle of half a loaf being better than no bread, I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1148</span>
should be compelled to support the principles of this series of Amendments in lieu of the Noble Lord's new Clause, which I consider would meet the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major DUDGEON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not like, on this question, to break the well-known unanimity of the Liberal party on all questions, but I absolutely agree with the arguments of the Minister of Agriculture and the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. Many of us who have practical experience of agriculture and of working with agriculturists realise how difficult it is to get statistics, and that to compile a register which would clearly and definitely show that a certain percentage of the producers of an agricultural product was in favour of any particular scheme, would take many months, if not years, to collect. If this Measure is to be of assistance to agriculture it is necessary that it should be placed on the Statute Book at the earliest date, and that the machinery should be so elastic that there should not be any undue delay. I agree with the Amendment before the Committee, but it appears to be the intention of some of the Amendments to put into this Bill in black and white as many provisions as possible. As my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Montrose Burghs (Sir R. Hutchison) said, this is a unique Measure in many respects, and it is very essential that its machinery should be as elastic as possible. We all agree that in certain respects the autocratic powers of Ministers should be largely controlled, but when we are making a new departure, as we are in this Bill, it is very desirable that the Minister should have a great deal of latitude.<br><br>
In regard to percentage, it may be necessary when dealing with a very considerable number of products, such as are mentioned in the Schedule, to have a different percentage in regard to different products and in regard to a different number of producers. Therefore, it would be very disastrous, if we are going to make the Bill effective, to put in a percentage that would unduly delay the whole machinery and prevent it from coming into full working order in regard to any particular scheme and in regard to any particular product. For these reasons, I deeply regret that I shall have to vote against my two hon. Friends on these benches, if we go to a Division.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1149</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Mover of the Amendment, I think I had better make the position perfectly clear, as I see it, seeing that the discussion is becoming somewhat confused. I think the case has been made out that this is not the right place at which we should insist that a definite poll and a definite percentage shall be provided for. I agree that this is not the convenient place. We contend that it shall not be left vaguely, that it shall be a body substantially representative, in the opinion of the Minister, or that it shall even be left to the report of a committee of inquiry, before a minority is coerced into giving up its existing way of selling its produce and compelled to sell through the Board. We are determined to press the matter to a Division if need be to secure that no substantial minority shall be coerced, but the right place in which to provide that is either in the new Clause which stands in the name of the Noble Lord the Member for Aldershot (Viscount Wolmer) or as an Amendment to Clause 3 (<i>b</i>).<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will appreciate our point. We do not want to delay the initiation of schemes by having to create a constituency before you have a scheme, but once you have a constituency we say that before that constituency is to be allowed to coerce the minority, we want to be satisfied by a poll of the producers and of nobody else, a democratic poll of the producers, that there is an overwhelming majority in favour of coercing the minority. That is the principle that goes right through the Bill and governs our attitude on Clause 7, Clause 13 and other parts of the Bill. Our attitude will be largely determined by the attitude taken up by the Government as to how far they are prepared to meet us in regard to the protection of the minorities. We are satisfied that there will be better feeling in the agricultural community if it is put clearly within the power of the producers themselves, and nobody else, to say just when the minority shall or shall not be coerced. I do not think that the statement of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland that no poll is possible, can be substantiated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not object to a poll.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an important thing. Let us look up the Bill
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1150</span>
and see what it says in regard to the revocation of a scheme:
<br><blockquote><p>"If the board satisfy him that the revocation of the scheme is desired by more than half the registered producers or by registered producers who produced more than half the quantity of the regulated product which was produced by all the registered producers during a period of six months ending not more than six months before the application."</p></blockquote>
There, we have a definition already in the Bill of just the kind of thing we want. We want that kind of machinery, and not a bare majority, in the Bill, to assure minorities of agriculturalists that it is not going to be any snap Division or any outside body that is going to proceed from the stage of a voluntary scheme to a compulsory scheme, forcing people to come in and to sell in a particular way through the operations of the Board. I agree with the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland that it is most important before a poll is taken that the country should know—and I hope that before we leave this Committee we shall know rather more—what will be the type of exemptions to be permitted under the Bill. Much of what we have been discussing this morning turns upon that. You cannot get satisfactory machinery—and it ought to be machinery put into the Statute—until you have some pretty clear idea what type of producer you will be dealing with in connection with the proposal in the Bill, which has been so much criticised, namely, the coercing of the minority. I think I have said enough to give the Minister an opportunity to give us some definite indication whether he will be prepared to consider the insertion, at the proper place in the Bill and at the proper stage in the development of the scheme, of a specific provision for a poll of the registered producers, so as to ensure that no substantial minority is forced into compulsory marketing in a particular way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the whole Committee will agree that we have had a most useful discussion on this very vital question. Before I come to the main issue I should like to reply to some questions that were put to me. In regard to the substitution of the word "representation" for "objection," I do not mind which word is adopted. I am willing that they should both be in, if
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0572">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1151</span>
necessary. All that we are concerned about is that the inquiry should be an inquiry directed to the elicitation of <i>bonâ fide</i> objections, and to the production of a report upon them. As to the person who shall conduct the inquiry, it must in the end, for the very good reason given by the right hon. Member for the New Forest (Colonel Ashley), be a responsibility attaching to the Minister; not that the Minister will himself hold the inquiry, but he must be responsible to Parliament, who can question him and hold him responsible if anything goes wrong. I do not object to it being provided in the proper place that the person who conducts the inquiry shall be "a competent and impartial person." Such words are in the Factory and Workshops Act, and nobody wants anything else. I am willing that words of that kind should be inserted.<br><br>
With reference to the main issue, which we have been discussing with great usefulness, there is now a common measure of agreement in the Committee that it would not be practicable to require the Minister, before a scheme was initiated, to be satisfied as to certain percentages. There is also agreement that we must have in the Bill, in an appropriate place, the requisite safeguards against the improper coercion of a minority. I accept that. The only question remaining, therefore, is ways and means. The reference to percentages mentioned in the First Schedule relates to a constituency and the volume of product which has been ascertained after the scheme is in operation. Therefore you have something to go upon. The Board will have a register of its producers. It will have in its books information of the volume of their product, and it is upon that that the matter will he ascertained.<br><br>
The Noble Lord the Member for Aldershot (Viscount Wolmer) has made a most valuable suggestion as to whether we could not meet the objections after the scheme had been floated. I accept, in general, without being committed to precise procedure, the idea which is embodied in his suggestion, and we will do our best to try to meet it. There is a further important point which we must make clear. We must have a register of those affected, not of those who might
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1152</span>
produce the commodity and who are not affected by the decision. It is quite easy to conjure up, without making any accusation, how a number of producers may be bullied or cajoled by interested persons dealing in the commodity into not having, shall we say, a, correct view. We want it to be a register of those who are really affected. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that exemption is a very important collateral matter. We cannot very well define in advance, though we shall discuss the matter when we reach it, the grounds for exemption, because it will vary so much with the different commodities. We must leave it to the reasonable people who draft a scheme, who know the job and are doing it—I hope the producers themselves—what is the style of exemption which is appropriate to the commodity. Clearly the local supply of what we commonly describe as the producer-retailer must be exempted from the working of any scheme. We cannot work a scheme if we have to deal with such details.<br><br>
We are aiming at the bulk market, and nobody administering a scheme would want it to be cumbered up with all kinds of small transactions which the persons concerned could very well conduct for themselves. The constituency affected by these exemptions ought not to be the constituency which votes in a matter where a question of policy comes in, because they are not going to he compelled anyhow. That is why I think that the suggestion of the Noble Lord is so valuable; at the stage when he is suggesting that the inquiry should be undertaken, we should have a register of those who will really be affected. The next question is how this is to be carried out. I would not like to be committed to detail at this moment, but I accept generally the idea, and I am willing to give effect to it. I will confer with hon. Members on all sides to see what we can devise.<br><br>
There are one or two considerations which we have been discusisng. I will mention one consideration that I am, inclined to favour rather more than the suggestion of the Noble Lord. He has picked out a certain number of ingredients of the scheme; it is true that they are the compulsory ingredients. I am not sure that it would not be preferable to say, "There is the scheme; we will put the whole scheme to you
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0573">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1153</span>
<i>en bloc;</i> do you like that scheme or not?" If we set up the whole scheme, the provision would come in Clause 3. We have considered another suggestion to which I should like to give more thought. It is a question whether you should put it the other way, and consider the percentage of objections. In some Dominions there is a provision of this kind. I do not think, speaking from recollection—I am not quite sure—that in any of them the percentage is more than 66. It is always upon a correct register. I have stated the position as frankly as I could, without being committed to the precise details and method of approach, which we will discuss in the same impartial way among ourselves when the matter is brought up. If hon. Members will consent to accept what I have said, I will ask them not to press their Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. CAUTLEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the Minister is satisfactory. He recognises, as I understand it, that in the initial stages of the formation of a scheme, it would be almost impossible to ascertain which of the producers are exempted, and which are to be registered producers. As the Bill stands, there would be great risk of the minority being coerced by a majority composed of persons who would not be affected by the scheme at all. I was much relieved to hear what fell from the Under-Secretary of State, because it happens that in my constituency and in Sussex there are a large number of small poultry producers. Next to Lancashire, we have the largest number of persons interested. They are very small people, but with the greatest assiduity they have established businesses with local connections, by which they retail a great part of their produce. They are very numerous, and I had great fear of the effect upon them of this Bill. The scheme proposed by the Noble Lord the Member for Aldershot (Viscount Wolmer) of taking a poll of the registered producers, with a requisiton as to the size of the majority, before a scheme is put into operation, meets a great deal of the doubt that I have. My objection to the Bill was the compulsion, and if it is clearly known who are to be exempt, if those exempted persons are not to vote, and if we have the majority ascertained for certain, a great part of the objection of the farming community would go. It would then rest entirely with the persons
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1154</span>
to be compelled whether they should be compelled or not. , That, I understand, is what the Minister means.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel HENEAGE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister raised the question of the producer-retailers being exempted. We ought to have more detail—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will come to that later on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel HENEAGE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the producer-retailer mean co-operative societies? Is the Minister going to allow the co-operative societies to vote, but not the small trader who is a retail-producer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I only used the retailer-producer as an illustration. What the board will say must depend on the commodity. A producer-retailer may mean one thing in one commodity, and something different in another. This question of exemptions comes up specifically in the Bill later on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel HENEAGE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that, but it was raised, and it is an important point. Before we have a decision on Clause 3, we shall want to know whether the Minister will eliminate all producers holding under one acre. If he does not, in the question of the sales of eggs some cottager who has two or three hens—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Every producer is entitled to come in, however big or small his holding may be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel HENEAGE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the first time we have had a statement from the Minister to that effect. I am glad that he is going to have consultations with us, but I should like to point out that he said he would have consultations on the Agricultural Land (Utilisation) Bill, but there were no consultations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with a good deal of pleasure to the Minister's statement, and as he is quite sympathetic with our point of view, I do not propose to move my Amendment, on the understanding that he will introduce Amendments which we can consider, and that we will have the opportunity of putting down other Amendments if his Amendments do not satisfy us.</span></p>

<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount WOLMER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Committee adjourns may I ask the Minister when he proposes to sit this afternoon and what his idea is as to our future meetings?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At our last meeting we arranged that we should meet at 4.30 this afternoon, but I am informed that that hour is somewhat inconvenient, and I suggest that we meet at five o'clock instead. I do not think we need prolong our proceedings very much. There are a large number of details of great importance in the Bill which should be fairly discussed, and I hope that hon. Members will agree to meet morning and afternoon on Tuesday and Thursday of next week. I understand that there is some objection to meeting on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount WOLMER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty about that arrangement is that the Conservative Agricultural Committee always meets at five o'clock on Tuesdays, and hon. Members might wish to attend that meeting. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will be able to meet us on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. HUTCHISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand that we are to meet this afternoon at five o'clock.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr</span><span class='membercontribution'>: ADDISON: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. HUTCHISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a little hard, because it was understood that if the question which we have been discussing this morning was dealt with we should not have to meet this afternoon. Another Committee is also meeting this afternoon and it means that two Standing Committees will be sitting upstairs as well as the House itself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>HON. MEMBERS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Adjourn the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At our last meeting I said that "as it is a very big issue the Committee will perhaps be willing to sit in the afternoon on Thursday as well." I agree that we have made progress this morning, but there is still a great deal before us in this Bill, and I think it is the general feeling of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1156</span>
Committee that we should try and get on with the Measure. I think we should meet at five o'clock.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>HON. MEMBERS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Agreed.</span></p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended until Five o'Clock.</i></p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. HUTCHISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. A short time ago I raised on the Floor of the House the question of the sitting of this Committee in the afternoon. I feel that with the important Debates that are taking place, and probably will take place next week, some reconsideration ought to be given to the announcement made by the Chairman that we shall sit next week on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. I think it as well that I should refer to the evidence given by the Prime Minister before the Select Committee on the hours of meeting and rising of the House. On page 54 of the Report of that Select Committee you will find the Prime Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I think it is very undesirable, as a rule, that important Standing Committees should sit when the House is sitting, because the effect of that is to divide the House of Commons into sections, and I am all for keeping the unity of the House of Commons."</p></blockquote>
I entirely agree with what the Prime Minister said, and my evidence before that Committee, which was given as Chief Whip, and which is to be found at page 17, was to the same effect. Mr. Chairman, I do not know whether the decision to meet a second time in one day is in your hands or not. I understand that a Chairman can direct a Standing Committee to sit for the first two hours, but that the calling of the Committee again for a further period on the same day rests with the Committee itself. I think, therefore, it is for the Members of this Committee to decide whether they wish to sit in the afternoon or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know that this is point of Order. There is nothing before the Committee. But perhaps I might say, for the guidance of the Committee, that the first meeting of the Committee is settled by the Chairman, and after that, on the Adjournment Motion, any Member can move the Adjournment to a given time, and it is a matter on which the Committee can, if it chooses, decide. These things are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0575">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1157</span>
usually settled by arrangement, but once the Committee is set up and has had its first meeting future meetings are in the hands of the Committee itself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene for a moment? I am sure the hon. and gallant Gentleman would not wish to delay our proceedings merely by discussing this matter. I thought it was a general understanding that we should meet this afternoon, and I am sorry that it has given rise to this inconvenience. At the same time I do not want to force the Committee, or to be a party to forcing the Committee, to do what it thinks is inconvenient or unreasonable; but of course this is a Bill which I think we all admit <i>con amore</i> has a large number of points which we should like to discuss. There is, I am sure, no question of any portion of the Committee obstructing its progress or anything of that sort. There are lots of things that ought to be discussed, because I want, and everybody wants, to make it a good workable Bill. In those circumstances merely two mornings a week does not seem sufficient, as the Bill would occupy an interminable time. That is the only consideration in my mind. I am in the hands of the Committee, but I would suggest that, in view of what was said downstairs, that perhaps next week we can see how we go along. Nobody knows better than the hon. and gallant Member that all those who are not on this Committee would not be assiduously sitting on the benches of the House listening to the Debate every Tuesday and every Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It depends on the business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the right hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Ormsby-Gore) says, it depends on the business. That is the proper reply. I would suggest that it would be well to leave our meetings to be determined by what is on in the House. If Members think they would prefer not to sit next Tuesday afternoon I do not wish to press it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount WOLMER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Following upon what has fallen from the Minister, since this morning I have had many representations made to me by hon. Members, that to sit in the afternoons of next week would be exceedingly inconvenient,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1158</span>
especially in view of the very heavy programme of work which the Government have just announced. If I may say so, I think the principle that the Minister has laid down is a reasonable one. It depends on the work that the House of Commons as a whole has to do. On that criterion, next week is going to be a very heavy week indeed for us. Therefore I hope, without prejudice to what future weeks may mean, that he will not ask us to sit on the afternoons of next Tuesday or next Thursday. Perhaps next Thursday morning he will be in a position to know, and through the usual channels will be able to let us know what the business in the following week is likely to be. Then, if he wants to ask us to sit in the afternoons we shall certainly consider it with a desire to meet him if we can. The ordinary private Members have not the same facilities with regard to their correspondence and all the rest, that Ministers have, and they find it very difficult to keep pace with their other work. I hope the Minister will not press us to sit in the afternoons next week and will not press us too much in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In those circumstances may I say that I would be quite willing to accept the Noble Lord's suggestion, and we will not press afternoon sittings next week?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. HUTCHISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is very desirable that next Thursday we should have what the Whips Office below have, namely, a knowledge of the business for the following week, which is not available to Members until it is given in the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must terminate this discussion. There is nothing before the Committee, and I am really guilty of a dereliction in allowing the discussion to take place at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. LAMB</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Subsection (1), at the end, to insert the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that the Minister shall not approve any scheme unless he is satisfied that it contains adequate financial provision for carrying out the purposes thereof."</p></blockquote>
In view of the very great kindness which you, Mr. Chairman, have shown previously to me during this meeting, I hope I shall be able to retain myself in order in what I say now. We attach
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0576">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1159</span>
very great importance to the question of the finance of all these schemes, and that is why we have put down this Amendment. We want to see in the Bill itself a guarantee that no scheme shall be put forward either for acceptance by the producers or by the wish of the Minister unless such schemes are going to be financially sound. I am quite aware that the Minister may reply by saying: "We shall see that the schemes are sound," but what my friends want is to see that it is put in the Bill that financial provision shall be included to make a scheme sound and give it a reasonable opportunity. The producers naturally require an assurance on this point. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland stated, this morning that it was agreed that guarantees should be given. He was not referring to this particular matter, but I hope he will agree that guarantees shall be given with regard to finances. He was at that time referring to the question of percentages, which we discussed this morning, but I believe it is absolutely as essential that the producers should have some guarantees with regard to the financial soundness of the schemes.<br><br>
I am afraid the Minister has not realised what these schemes really mean from a financial standpoint. I take it that under this Bill we shall be undertaking the marketing, or the distribution at any rate, of the bulk products of agriculture fairly generally. I wonder whether we realise really what that means. There is a tremendous amount of capital already engaged in distribution throughout the country. The Minister stated that the value of the liquid milk product alone of this country was £56,000,000. I do not know what the capital of the United Dairies might be, but that is only one scheme. The amount of money which is invested in the distribution of milk alone must be a fabulous sum. Undoubtedly that is not going to be raised by levies on agriculture. They could not find the money. Neither could the country find it. Not only that, but there are the co-operative societies, which have a tremendous amount of money involved in their business; a certain section of their business would probably be undertaken by these schemes, and the money which they have now invested in connection with those
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1160</span>
distribution purposes would have to be found either by them or by somebody else. I will come to the question later on as to where the money may have to come from. The sums involved are enormous. Do we realise what a, responsibility this will be either upon the agriculturists who are producers, who could not provide the money, or upon the Government who would be unwilling to provide it? With those two eliminated, I do not know where the money is coming from.<br><br>
I do not know whether I should be in order in making the statement, but in my opinion at some time during the consideration of this Bill finance will be the question which will force us to take into consideration the present distributors in this country. We shall have to ask for their assistance. It may be that they do not suggest they should have the right to formulate schemes, but I believe the producers will have to have the right of asking the distributors who now have their capital invested in these things to come forward and assist in the schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They can do so now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. LAMB</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that will be the only way in which it can be done. At some time during the consideration of the Bill, and certainly at some time during the operation of the schemes, the distributors will have to be brought in, if for no other purpose than bringing in the ability which they undoubtedly have, and also bringing in the capital which they have invested up to the present time. All these schemes are going to stand or fall, as other businesses do, upon their financial soundness. That is why we desire that there shall be definitely placed in the Bill a statement that reasonable provisions for the financial soundness of the schemes shall be given by the Minister at the time when the schemes are accepted. I do feel very strongly on this important point, and I hope the Minister will be able to say that he is willing to accept this Amendment and to assure us that he will not, even under the Bill, bring forward any scheme which does not contain some financial provisions which shall ensure, not only the soundness of the scheme, but a reasonable prospect of its being carried out successfully when put into operation.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These words of the Amendment are entirely unnecessary. I cannot imagine a scheme of any sort or kind getting through the network of inquiry and investigation, which any scheme would have to do unless the question as to whether it was likely to be a successful and a sound one was not the first question which everybody asked about it. The scheme in the first place would be proposed by the producers. It is reasonable to assume that they would think it a sound scheme; otherwise they would not propose it. When they have proposed it, it has to go through the sieve of a local inquiry. The man responsible for that inquiry will, at the very first, say, "Is this scheme sound? Is it reasonably watertight? Are the proposed arrangements for a levy, or whatever it might be, on the producers, adequate to finance the operations of the scheme?" and so on. Those will be the ingredients of the scheme which would be most prominent and vital, and no consideration of the scheme could leave them out.<br><br>
Then the next thing is that the Minister has to report it to Parliament, and he has to say what he thinks about it as the result of these reports and so forth, and why he recommends it. Then Parliament will have a cut at it and criticise it or approve it. This is an elementary condition of every scheme, and if you are going recite one condition of a scheme you would have to recite all the others. The Amendment is quite unnecessary, and I can assure the hon. Member that he need have no misgiving that any imaginable group of persons who consider the scheme would not consider these elements. Of course they would.<br><br>
I was not quite clear as to what the hon. Member said about the distributors. Anyhow there would be included, no doubt, a scheme of co-operation with distributors. It is open to the proposers of the scheme to shape it in any way they wish in the interests of the producers of the commodity. There is nothing to rule out any particular type of scheme. But we could not provide in the Bill—and I hope the Committee will never ask me to do so—that these schemes shall rest on anything else except the good will and initiative of the producers. It is for them that the scheme is designed. If
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1162</span>
they wish to bring in distributors, by all means let them do so, but it is going to be their choice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel RUGGLES-BRISE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully share the view put forward by my hon. Friend Who moved this Amendment. He told the Committee that in his view the success or failure of this Bill when in operation would largely depend upon finance. That is true. I am amazed that the Minister should dismiss this question of finance in such a light-hearted manner. He says there will be many schemes put up, and it will be his duty to examine the finance of the scheme, just as he will have to examine every other detail connected with the scheme, and he says it is not likely that any body of producers will submit to him a scheme which they consider to be unsound. But may I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether it is not a matter of almost daily occurrence that bodies of people get together and have some idea as to how to make money successfully, and hatch up a scheme, and issue prospectuses which never fulfil expectations?<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman in a recent speech alluded to Mr. Hatry's operations, and there is no doubt that among producers there are a certain number of potential Hatry's. There are in every walk of life and among every body of persons, and it is quite likely that a number of producers might submit what would appear to be on the face of it an extremely specious and reasonable proposition, but which in fact might be wholly unsound financially. I think the right hon. Gentleman ought to feel grateful to my hon. Friend for suggesting the insertion in the Bill of this very important reminder that no scheme should be sanctioned unless it is financially sound. How can it be financially sound? What are the limitations, of the money available to enter into the enormous trading operations contemplated by the Bill? My hon. Friend mentioned the question of the milk trade; and potatoes also leap to the mind. Conceive a scheme which is going to be set up to handle the marketing of a product like milk or potatoes. It involves a turnover of many millions a year. In the Bill the total amount provided is something a little over half a million. Out of that half million will have to be found annually a very large sum in salaries for all the various people
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0578">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1163</span>
who will operate as members of the various committees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, not out of that money at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel RUGGLES-BRISE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said a little over half a million, of which £40,000 is for the payment of salaries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. It is entirely a separate fund.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel RUGGLES-BRISE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is limited to a half million on which to embark on the handling of the whale production of milk or potatoes, or of both, in this country. On a farmer occasion he told us that the Board, in a case like that, would be able to go to the banks and borrow. Borrowing from the banks is a perfectly legitimate process in any trading business, always provided that you have behind you a certain amount of capital of your own; but it is absolutely unsound to embark on any trade operation at all on borrowed money where there is the possibility not only of making a, profit but also of making a loss, and it is obvious that out of the very small amount of capital available for the financing of these very large operations many of these schemes will be floated without sufficiently sound financial backing.<br><br>
There are two risks in connection with the production of any article. There is the producer's risk. Take, for instance, the man who keeps cows. He takes the risk whether or not he can sell his milk at a reasonable ratio of profit. But that is not the end of all the risks. There is the trading risk. In the majority of cases that trading risk is undertaken by individuals, or by individuals who have formed themselves into a company for the handling and, if you like, for the exploiting of the trading of a certain article; but under this Bill you are going to put on to the shoulders of the producers not merely the producer's risk but the trading risk—and without sufficient capital to enable them to carry that risk in the event of a loss being made.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman seems to think that a profit is a certainty. Those who have been in business know that a lass is very likely to arise in almost any business, especially in that dealing with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1164</span>
perishable articles, and most agricultural products are perishable. It makes the trading risk a very grave one. Therefore, I think the right hon. Gentleman is wholly wrong in dismissing so lightly what I think would be a great improvement to the Bill. There is nothing wrecking about this Amendment. It merely strengthens the hands of the Minister for the time being. As regards the trader, what is the position? In regard to a regulated product you are going to take the business out of the trader's hands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel RUGGLES-BRISE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious that when a board is set up to handle a regulated product, the operations of that board will take the place of the operations which are now conducted by what we call the trade. That must be so. Just consider. You have got a trader dealing to-day in a regulated product, and to-morrow, when the board is set up, that man's trade will be taken away from him. [HON. MEMBERS: "No, no!"] That is an absolute fact. [HON. MEMBERS: "No, no!"] I do not think there is anything controversial in what I am saying. I am pointing out what will he the result of the setting up of a board under this Bill as regards trading in a regulated product. The position may arise where a body of traders dealing, for instance, in milk or potatoes, find that the board has come into existence and has displaced them from their business. The board has come into existence with capital not provided by the producers who form the board, but provided with a certain amount of capital by the State. Therefore, you are going to set up a board dealing with regulated products financed in part by the State.<br><br>
Now suppose, for the sake of argument, that the board should not meet with success and should prove a failure, due, perhaps, among other reasons, to faulty finance. It is rather a curious position. You have sent the private trader perhaps out of business altogether, and after he has been driven out by a board financed by the State the scheme of the board may collapse. That is a position which should be contemplated by the Minister and he should consider whether he cannot accept this most reasonable Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel HENEAGE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I really think the Minister might accept this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0579">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1165</span>
Amendment, because he has admitted that this is what he proposes to do. Suppose that we have another Minister who is not so careful as the right hon. Gentleman in financial matters. He will be able to say that there is nothing in this Bill which makes finance one of the first considerations. I do not think that the risks that are taken are quite appreciated. In the Agricultural Land (Utilisation) Bill we had a corporation set up, and the question of the responsibility of Parliament is fairly clearly laid down. Here the responsibility of Parliament is very vague. You cannot really say that Parliament has any hold over the finance of this Bill at all as these boards are set up. Let me add to this two risks that I do not think have been appreciated. One is what I call the holding-up risk. The board may say that a scheme is hopeless, and they may hold it up. Some large undertakings like the Co-operative Wholesale Society may be able to do that, but a lot of enthusiastic producers, really wishful to start a scheme, may not realise the risk they have to undertake in order to get a fair return at some future date. The second point is that unless there is something definite in this Bill about financial responsibility there is the whole question of minorities to be taken into account. The Minister says that he will go into the question of a levy with producers, and I take it that that means that there will be a levy on those who do not wish to go into the scheme, and, if that is going to be so, the Minister should carefully watch the financial provisions of any scheme put up, and it will be safer to put that in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BARNES</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My difficulty with this Amendment is that I doubt the wisdom of transferring the judgment whether the scheme is sound or not from the practical men who are to handle the scheme to the Minister. I feel that he is not in a better position to decide it than those people who have the experience of their own business. With all business proposals there is a risk, and these boards will have to take it. Whether it is big or small and whether they shall take advantage of the facilities are matters in which they must depend on their own knowledge. I feel that we cannot get away from that elementary business consideration. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1166</span>
feel some sympathy with the point that the existing machinery of the trade and the immense capital invested in handling foodstuffs in this country should not be lightly interfered with, but I do not assume for a moment that the producers' organisations will ignore this machinery. It seems only common sense that they should recognise it. As far as the cooperative movement is concerned, we have always been anxious to assist in the improvement of marketing facilities in this country. We do not anticipate that this organisation will supersede the existing co-operative movement. Otherwise our good will and sympathy for this reorganisation would have to turn in another direction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. LAMB</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, why did one of your Members raise this question and press for a reply on the Second Reading?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BARNES</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a perfectly sensible thing, when you are engaging in a scheme of reorganisation, to recognise that there must be some amount of reaction on existing trading machinery and to take fair steps to prevent unnecessary injury. As far as the co-operative movement is concerned, our only concern is to see that reorganisation does not take a wrong line and lead to exploitation of the consumer. On the simple point of this Amendment it does seem to me that the business judgment as to whether schemes are sound is better in the hands of practical persons than imposed on the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount WOLMER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Member for Stone (Sir J. Lamb) has done a valuable service in bringing this matter forward and laying stress on the fundamental importance of finance, and I do not think the Minister really met his case. Of course the producers will consider finances and the Minister will have to consider them, but I think it would have been a distinct gain to have it laid down in the Bill and to have charged upon the Minister the duty of satisfying himself with all the resources of the reorganisation commission at his disposal, that the finances of schemes are sound. The discussion this morning, however, has an important bearing on this question. As long as the Bill remained in its original form I think my hon. Friend was justified in bringing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0580">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1167</span>
forward this Amendment, because there was no guarantee that the finances of schemes would be adequately placed before the registered producers in sufficient detail for them to satisfy themselves that they were sound. If we can insert a Clause on the lines of the one which the Minister says he is prepared to accept in principle, we shall be able to guarantee that all the registered producers, before being involved in any financial commitment, will have a detailed scheme before them, and it can be carried only by a three-quarter majority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not agree to the figure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount WOLMER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister agreed in principle, and I suggest that the best thing at the moment would be for my hon. Friend to withdraw this Amendment, with complete liberty to bring it up on the Report stage if the Minister's version of the suggested Clause does not satisfy us. Many other questions of this Bill will depend on this Clause and the details of the scheme getting a careful consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. LAMB</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very reluctant to withdraw this Amendment, and many Members on this side do not wish me to do so. If I can receive some encouragement that the Minister is going to accept the Clause referred to, and if I can retain the right to bring this matter up on the Report stage, if I am not satisfied, I shall be content. There is a danger, however, of my not being called. I do not want to hurt or delay the Bill, but to strengthen it. I wish to fall in with the wishes of the Committee, but I do not want to jeopardise the opportunity of putting something in this Bill which will provide that the finances are fully considered. Perhaps the Minister will say that in certain eventualities he will put down a Clause himself, and then of course it will be called by Mr. Speaker in the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will do my best, and when we get to the Clause that we discussed this morning, although of course I cannot speak for the Speaker, if the hon. Member is not satisfied, I will endeavour to provide him with an opportunity for discussing it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1168</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel ACLAND-TROYTE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are very much handicapped in discussing matters arising out of this Bill by the fact that this is an important Clause and a great many Amendments hang on it, and I consider it is necessary to force this Amendment unless we know definitely what the new Clause will be. We know how the Agricultural Land (Utilisation) Bill was rushed through the House of Commons—Report and Third Reading in an all-night sitting. The same thing may happen with this Bill, and it is necessary to stand by this provision, which we think will be necessary if the new Clause is not passed. It is easy to say, "Put things off, and a new Clause will be moved," but the new Clause may be thrown out, and, therefore, I think it is necessary to divide on this Amendment. The hon. Member who spoke on the other side apparently had not read Clause 3 (<i>a</i>). If so, he would see what these boards can do, and that is where they may interfere with co-operative and other societies. I do not say they will do it, but we have to legislate in view of what can be done. It is not enough to say, "You cannot imagine anybody doing this." If a thing is wrong, you must make it impossible, and if it is right we must make it obligatory. We are told that we cannot imagine the Minister doing something, but we cannot pass laws which depend on what the Ministers thinks. We have to tie him down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You will not make me think by tying me down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel ACLAND-TROYTE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The present Minister may have a definite intention and give all sorts of pledges, but the next Minister may have very different ideas, and what the right hon. Gentleman says that no Minister would think of doing another Minister may think and do. I am surprised at the Minister refusing to accept this Amendment, because it is obviously his intention that ifs purpose should be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHANCELLOR of the DUCHY of LANCASTER (Mr. Attlee)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest one point for consideration in reply? It is to consider the bearing of this proposal on the general construction and plan of the Bill. In dealing with this matter you can take one of two lines. You can either say that you are going to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0581">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1169</span>
have as much State regulation as possible, that you are going to put the whole thing under the control of the Minister, who has to see that the finance is right and to watch it in every possible way, or you can take the other line and say that it is essentially a matter in which there is going to be control by the boards of producers. The right hon. Member for the New Forest (Colonel Ashley) supports that view. He has always been somewhat more of a syndicalist Man a Socialist. The idea of this Bill is that the work should be done by the producers. If the hon. and gallant Member can be satisfied that these boards are going to be set up by a substantial majority of the producers, he will then get a scheme running in which the plan is put forward by responsible people who will put in their own controls and look after their own business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. CHARLES WILLIAMS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that probably the Minister was right in a sense when he said that this Amendment was unnecessary, because he believed it unnecessary from the fact that you are first of all to have producers fully consulted, and they naturally would not pass a scheme unless they thought it sound. With the producers he also brought in the objectors, and they too would bring the scheme into fullest consultation, and then the scheme would have to be approved by Parliament. He imagined that Parliament would naturally, from time to time, when these schemes came before it, assume that the Minister was more or less responsible for them. That is what, I think, was the basis of his case.<br><br>
I am the last person who wishes to see these schemes unduly interfered with by Ministerial control, but, on the other hand, as these words stand, we cannot possibly afford to wait until some new Clause has been put in. We must legislate for these Clauses as we go through them. Therefore, it is essential that we should put this Amendment in here, because it is clearly laid down that on a scheme which has to go before Parliament, if any question was raised on it before Parliament, the Minister would have to explain. I think there would be no harm in having it in the Bill
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1170</span>
that the Minister should look into the financial side of a scheme.<br><br>
Wherever you have had Government interfering by legislation with any form of trade of this kind, you have always seen that when there has been a failure it has been considered that the people who have failed have a justified claim to come before Parliament and get help from Parliament. You have had it over and over again. Only last night, on Estimates which some people were anxious to prevent our discussing, we had the zinc contracts which were undertaken during the War. This and many other questions make it perfectly plain that Parliament sooner or later may be called upon to help in the financing of the schemes in the event of failure. From the purely financial point of view I think there should be some responsibility on the shoulders of the Minister. It ought to be quite clearly put down in the Bill that it is the primary duty of the Minister, in connection with the schemes, to go into them from a financial point of view.<br><br>
I do not think that the Minister or the objectors or the producers or Parliament can possibly say whether each of these schemes is going to be financially sound or not. You cannot know until they have been put into operation. It is quite impossible to lay down whether they will succeed or fail; but in spite of that, the very fact that the Minister would have a financial check would be of immense value to Parliament, and ultimately would safeguard the position of taxpayers as a whole. For this reason I hope that my hon. Friend will force this particular Amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. HUTCHISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that this Amendment has been discussed, because it is a very important one. After all, we have had experience of what amount of money is required to finance produce going from the producer to the ultimate consumers. We have the experience of the German board which dealt with potatoes. There you had a board which required millions sterling to handle, and it is undoubtedly true that if producers are going to have a scheme such as is forecast in this Bill, they will want some security and some immediate payment. A lot of finance will be required, because in times of glut something will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0582">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1171</span>
have to be done with the surplus, just as in Germany they had to deal with the surplus of potatoes. At the same time I see the point of the Minister. He does not want the great responsibility to be on his shoulders. I do think that in this Bill we require some declaration that before accepting the scheme the Minister will be able to provide the necessary finance from the Treasury.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. DALLAS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. Is there anything in this Amendment which goes to show that the State is going to provide the money?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>An HON. MEMBER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is an implied guarantee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is not the place to discuss what are adequate financial provisions. The proper place for that will be in Clause 5 or on a new Clause. The only question here, is whether such financial provision is to be made in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. HUTCHISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is quite true, but my point is that in the case of the boards which are handling these products, the Minister obviously must have a certain responsibility that they are financially sound. There should be something in the Bill to the effect that the Minister is satisfied that when a scheme is put up the finance will be such that the producers selling to the board will have some security. I take it from what the Minister has said, that he would not pass a scheme unless he was satisfied that it was financially sound.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. HUTCHISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then there is nothing more to be said on the matter. I am glad that the point has been discussed, because it is one of the most vital things in this marketing business. The two most vital things are, the matter of compulsion when the small minorities stand out, and the question of finance on the other side.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel ASHLEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I confess that when my hon. Friend moved this Amendment I was not in sympathy with it, because I thought it was obvious that one of the very first things that a Minister must do in considering the scheme would be to satisfy himself that the finance of the scheme was reasonably sound. But I sense a feeling in this Committee, not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1172</span>
only on these benches but on the Liberal benches, and even possibly among the hon. Members opposite, that this is a provision which is rather different from anything else, for this reason; You may have compulsion, and you may have a minority of 10, 20 or 25 per cent., and if you are going to compel 20 or 25 per cent. of the producers in a locality to come into the scheme, and to be liable to find money if the thing goes wrong, then it seems to me you ought to be especially careful to see that those 25 per cent. are properly safeguarded. The Minister's reply is that they will be properly safeguarded because any successor of his will as a matter of practical politics satisfy himself as to the finance of the scheme. But that is not sufficient to make the scheme work.<br><br>
The farmer is, very naturally, distrustful of the politicians. He hates legislation which affects him, because he feels he has been let down for a great number of years as compared with the town dweller. Therefore, unless you are able to tell him that one of the duties put upon the Minister by Parliament is to see that the farmer is as far as humanly possible safeguarded, he will decline to come into the scheme. With a view to the success of this Bill I urge the Minister to accept some words which make it quite clear to the farmers and producers generally that finance will be safeguarded as far as humanly possible, when the Minister gives sanction to the scheme. If you can by putting it in black and white help the success of your scheme you ought to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree with the object that hon. Members above the Gangway have in view, namely, that any scheme submitted shall have adequate financial provisions. But I think we are getting mixed up in what we are talking about. We forget that we are still in the initial stages of the presentation of a scheme. What we are talking about under Clause 1 is the presentation of a scheme to the Minister. I should have thought any ordinary individual would have said that the first thing the Minister must ensure is to see that any scheme submitted to him is financially sound. The Minister wants to establish a new method of marketing, and if he is foolish enough to allow a scheme to go through which is not financially sound and there-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0583">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1173</span>
by courts disaster straightaway, then the whole of his Bill is gone and everything connected with marketing will be gone. There is, however, another point. Members above the Gangway have made a lot of the fact that provision will be made for the establishment of a board which will be a trade board, buying and selling, and handling large quantities of products. I hope that when this Bill leaves this Committee it will be possible to establish boards that will be doing very little trading, and perhaps no trading at all; boards that will not have tremendous financial obligations cast upon them, but which will be of tremendous value to sections of industry. In that case much of the argument goes.<br><br>
There is another point. This Bill is going to provide for a public inquiry be- fore any board can be set up or any scheme accepted. If that is so, surely it would be one of the really good objections that would be laid against any scheme at a public inquiry if the Minister was foolish enough to pass a scheme which was not financially sound. I can imagine no stronger ground of objection to any scheme being put into operation than that the financial proposals contained in the scheme are unsound. Along those lines I think we are fairly safe. I do want some common sense to be used. There are some things that I do not like in the Bill, but I feel that this is one of those elementary things that any Minister must look after, and if the Minister fails to do so then the public inquiry would be the place where objections will be raised and the matter will be put right. I think the Member who moved the Amendment would be wise to withdraw it. He can raise the matter again when he comes to Clause 5 if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MAITLAND</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member who has just sat down has said that there is an implied responsibility on the Minister, but he objected to that responsibility being expressed in terms. We are in fact going to strengthen the hands of the Minister by expressly stating it in terms. The argument which has been advanced that, because it is in the initial stages we need not worry about it, is to my mind one of the really strong arguments for saying that this is the proper and appropriate place for doing it. Some
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1174</span>
hon. Gentlemen opposite have objected to the suggestion that we are making a change in the marketing system. I do not want to use a term which is in any sense offensive, but this is an attempt to improve the marketing system. If we are going to interfere with that system at all we cannot do so by legislation without the ensuing responsibility. It is well at the outset that in thinking of the financial provision we should have regard to the powers conferred upon the Board. I hope some such words as these will be inserted, because I believe that in the initial stages of any scheme it will be a source of strength to say at the outset that it is a statutory obligation to see that any scheme proposed is financially sound.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. LAMB</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am willing to withdraw the Amendment on the distinct understanding that if we are not satisfied with the new Clause we shall have the right at a later stage to put down an Amendment, and I hope the Minister will then consider it.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel HENEAGE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (2), to leave out the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"and nothing in any scheme shall apply to any product, is so far as it is produced outside the area to which the scheme is applicable."</p></blockquote>
We are now coming to rather a new point in connection with the Bill. I hope the Minister when he replies will tell us what he has in mind as to the areas. May I put some of the difficulties before him so as to give him a lead? First of all, it is obvious that an area may be the whole country; secondly, it may be some local government division like a county; and thirdly, it may be an area where a particular product is grown. One of the objects which I have in moving the omission of these words is that I am not satisfied that a geographical area is entirely satisfactory. If you could imagine the area of a product, that is, combining together the people who actually grow a particular thing, it might be rather more suitable than a geographical area. I shall not develop that, because I think a short explanation will make it clear what I have in mind. It would be, in fact, an area dealing with products, rather than an area dealing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0584">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1175</span>
with the ground on which the products grow.<br><br>
If the Minister has not quite understood what I mean, may I say this? Suppose that you take an area like Lincolnshire. You might club together under one board several different products in Lincolnshire. On the other hand, just outside there might be something which you want to bring in. Suppose that it was a limited product only grown in the Eastern Counties. Then, if you said that everybody who grows or produces that particular thing will be in the scheme, that would not be entirely a geographical area. Geographically, one is rather limited by the local authorities. I should like to show by reference to the Census of Production, the great difficulty the Minister will have in defining any area at all. If we take cereals, we look at the arable land and we see quite obviously that the Eastern Counties have a large proportion of arable land, and then there is a large gap until you come to Cornwall. ft is very difficult to see a scheme which will embrace the two.<br><br>
I would like the Minister to say how he proposes to deal with difficulties of that kind. If we take the number of acres of oats per 100 acres of arable land as 20 per hundred in 1925, we see a very large part of the country deals with that product—all North of the Humber including Lancashire, the whole of Wales and Devon, missing out Cornwall—a very awkward part of the country to deal with. With regard to cattle, cattle is fairly uniformly distributed all over the country, but if you will take the part of the country where there is very little cattle, rather to one's surprise one finds the part of the country where there is least is Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Hertford, Cambridge and Huntingdon. That is the slice you can keep out, but over the whole of the rest of the country cattle is fairly evenly distributed, Cornwall and Cheshire being the part where there is most. It is rather difficult to see where the centre for a scheme at that time would lie. Take the question of sheep. I am sorry to say that Lincolnshire is not as high in sheep, although Lincolnshire sheep are well known for being the best in the world.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1176</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Northumberland is the winner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel HENEAGE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, you find the winner is two counties in Wales, where you, Mr. Chairman, come from. You will also find that Northumberland is very high up, and some of the other Welsh counties are also very high up. The number of sheep per thousand acres, in two of the counties of Wales is over 2,000, and in the case of Northumberland it is over 1,600, with a fairly even distribution over the rest of the country. Coming to chickens. I confess that the distribution of chickens has entirely altered since we had the very excellent grading and marketing arrangements brought in by the Conservative Government. England expects that every chicken will do its duty and lay its eggs, and so it does under the regulations brought in by the Conservative Government.<br><br>
Passing on to milk, we see that the Minister's task will be easier. There is the area round Cheshire and the area round Somerset, and perhaps round Hampshire. I think I have said enough to show that some of these products will be extraordinarily difficult for the Minister to deal with. There is another point which ought to be dealt with, and that is by-products. How is the Minister to deal with the by-products in an area? He deals with milk, and he deals with cheese which is the by-product of milk. On the other hand, he mentions cereals alone, and does not deal with offals. Is he anticipating an area where offals will be taken into consideration, because I see considerable difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So do I in dissociating offals from cereals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel HENEAGE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is also the question of sugar beet. I can quite see that if the scheme is a success, a considerable demand will come for marketing sugar beet. I want to know what he considers will be the limitations of a scheme to deal with sugar beet—how far up to the sugar he will have to consider the beet. I have dealt as briefly as I can with a very intricate and a very important part of the Bill, and I hope we shall get a full explanation from the Minister on these words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ATTLEE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and gallant Member has raised an extremely in-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0585">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1177</span>
teresting point. He was quite right in suggesting that the Board were not going to take a local government area. The idea is essentially based on the product. In some cases the scheme will necessarily have to be one embracing the whole of England and Wales, and perhaps also Scotland, or there will be some mutual arrangement between them. On the other hand you may have; some specialised products confined to a certain area. It might not be exactly a local government area, but you can always define your schemes sufficiently widely to leave a margin in that ease. The point is that in each case it is for the producers to submit a scheme. There are also proposals later on with regard to assisting in forming those schemes. What exactly the producers do depends on what they want to do—the sort of scheme they will put up. They are the people who know.<br><br>
It may be taken that the approval of schemes has to take into account many things. That point is whether those things are going to work. One cannot imagine a. scheme, setting up a number of rival associations for a similar product, being approved. On the other hand there might be some sort of federal arrangement of various associations in which part of the work was 'done locally and part done on a national basis. The broad general answer to the hon. and gallant Member is that it depends on the product, and on the will of the producers, as to whether the scheme is one applying to a particular small area, or to a large area, or to the whole country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount WOLMER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to try to clear up an ambiguity, because I am mystified as to what the words of the Bill mean in this connection. I would like to ask the Minister to compare these lines which we are now discussing with the first two lines of Clause 2, which say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every scheme shall provide for the registration of any producer who make application for that purpose."</p></blockquote>
The question I want to put is this: Suppose that a Lancashire board was set up for any commodity, and some. producer of that commodity just outside the area wanted to join the board because he normally sent his produce to markets with which that board was going to deal,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1178</span>
would the words which we are now discussing,
<br><blockquote><p>"nothing in any scheme shall apply to any product, in so far as it is produced outside the area"</p></blockquote>
prevent, say, a Cheshire farmer from applying under Clause 2, to be a member of the Lancashire board?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Noble Lord appreciates, the object of the scheme is to see that its advantages accrue to the producers within the area. If a producer outside the area applied to be registered as a producer, the board would be bound to register him, but they would not deal with his product, because it would not be produced within that area—so far as this particular scheme is concerned, because the scheme applies to the product produced within the area. As a matter of fact that would not arise, because unless the commodity was produced in that area its sales would not be assisted and regulated by the board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel HENEAGE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I put a practical difficulty? How is the right hon. Gentleman going to deal with cattle? Suppose that a man outside an area drives his cattle inside the area, he will have to be dealt with?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was only taking the narrow point which the Noble Lord raised, which was the interpretation point. Nobody would produce a cattle scheme which would have that kind of consequence. You could not have a cattle scheme for a limited area for the same kind of cattle. It would not be workable. I cannot imagine a cattle scheme, except where it is national, applied to a particular type of cattle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. R. W. SMITH</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Take the case of a scheme being set up in an area for potatoes, and there were certain traders who were going to use the surplus potatoes for manufacture into alcohol. It might be that it would mean a loss not to run the factory for the production of alcohol. Would these people be precluded from purchasing potatoes outside their area and using them in their factory for the manufacture of alcohol?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rather mystified by the Minister's reply. He virtually says that it is quite obvious
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0586">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1179</span>
that these schemes must deal with byproducts, and yet here we have a definite suggestion of limitation of area. I will give one concrete example. Take Cheshire cheese. The bulk of Cheshire cheese is produced in Cheshire, but probably a few firms in Flintshire and quite a considerable number of firms in North Shropshire, and some firms in Staffordshire, make cheese which is recognised as Cheshire cheese, and market it as Cheshire cheese although it is not made in Cheshire. Would the leaving of these words in this Clause mean that if the Cheshire Farmers' Association made a scheme of their own covering their production, they would control the market and be able virtually to penalise, or to keep out of the scheme, the people on the fringe of the county, and prevent them from producing an identical article?<br><br>
I cannot see quite what is the point of having these words in the Bill. What is the objection to stating that any scheme submitted as aforesaid is applicable to Great Britain or any part of it, and leaving it there? I may be quite wrong, but I do not see the point of having these areas in the Statute, because all kinds of complex matters where you are dealing with areas and products are bound to crop up. The words seem to be very complex and I think they would be better out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major DUDGEON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This sub-section really raises very grave concern among many who are very favourably disposed to this Bill as a Bill, because it is a Measure promoted to regulate the marketing of agricultural products, but the final objective of the Measure, if it is to be effective and advantageous to the agricultural industry, is to stabilise prices of certain products at a profitable level. If we are going to have areas—and in some products it is quite possible that we shall have one, two or three, because there are variations of type within the general classification—and if products from outside the area are to be brought in and disposed of within the area where the scheme is operating, the whole basis of establishing stabilised prices will disappear. Therefore I consider it of extreme importance that this question should be thrashed out on this Sub-section, because if the Bill is not going to maintain a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1180</span>
certain measure of stabilisation of prices at a profitable level it will be very little value to the agricultural industry.<br><br>
I am assured by a number of organisations in the country that they have very grave fears in regard to this question of a certain area of Great Britain being selected for a scheme which is brought into operation and then brought down by products of a similar nature coming in from outside, from an area where there is no scheme. I think the Minister will be well advised to take into account the many representations which I know he is receiving and to remodel this Clause. The Amendment would give him a free hand to deal with these products from areas outside the scheme. With regard to the question of exempting an individual producer within the scheme, I take it that it will be made essential that the producer who receives the exemption will not sell below the price agreed upon by the board, and if it is reasonable to make that provision in regard to an individual producer, it is reasonable to make some provision that those who produce a product outside the area of a scheme should have to conform to a price level.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am quite sure that the words in the Bill are necessary with regard to the particular scheme, because we have to consider that in the case of the kind of commodity the hon. Member had in his mind just now, the case of milk, we are dealing with a typical case in which a commodity may be sent unchanged into an area to be sold there at a lower price than that which rules in the area. That is the case which is often put to us. Now, of course, no milk scheme could be approved which contained that possibility. That is my reply. As far as milk is concerned, where you have a commodity which, as I was saying, is sold unchanged and is readily transportable, you cannot have a local area scheme. I cannot conceive any case of a scheme being approved by the producers which would leave them open to such disastrous competition as the hon. Member has mentioned. I cannot imagine anything but a national area with a thing like milk. If we take other cases, such as Worcester hops or Kentish apples or Cheshire cheese, there it may be necessary to take into consideration
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0587">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1181</span>
the area to which the scheme applies, because in that particular case you want an arrangement for organising the sales of that particular commodity, and therefore you must base your scheme on the conditions which apply.<br><br>
In such a case as that of Cheshire cheese you will take care that the district in which that commodity is produced will be the area under the scheme. If the Noble Lord (Viscount Wolmer) will look at Clause 16 he will see, on page 15, that a producer means any person who produces a regulated product. Then, if you read that in conjunction with Clause 1 you will see that a regulated product is a product that is produced within that area. It is perfectly evident, therefore, that wherever a producer lives, as far as his production of the regulated product is concerned, it is the one produced within the area of the scheme. The prospect of the outsider coming in, therefore, does not arise, because he would not be a producer within the meaning of the Act, unless he were producing a regulated product and, if it were produced outside the area it would not be a regulated product.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister realise that in the case of potatoes, for instance, he may have a scheme for Scotland and two or three for different districts of England? The regulated products would be potatoes—King Edwards say. May they not be from outside the prescribed area and sent inside the area at a lower price?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree, but in that case it would be a very unsound scheme and no sensible producers would put it up. Unless you are going to assume that the producers are going to put up a scheme which will help themselves, this Bill is no use. No producers would put up a scheme whereby it was open to somebody in the next county to come and knock the bottom out of their scheme. That would never be approved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel RUGGLES-BRISE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we leave the subject I would like to press the Minister for another explanation. I have been waiting for him to answer this important point. In the consideration of this Bill, two points have been raised in opposition. The first is that the producer in one area would be able to enter another area and under-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1182</span>
sell, and the second that both the producer in one area and in the other may be under-sold by the foreigner. These were the points raised on the Second Reading, and now in Committee we are dealing with the first of these lines of criticism. Take the county of Kent. You may have in Sussex a producer who has established for many years a market in Kent and he sends his eggs and poultry across the border into Kent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would not be a useful scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel RUGGLES-BRISE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: According to the definition in Clause 16 the producer in Sussex would be a producer for the purposes of the scheme. But when his products went over the border into Kent, we are told, according to Clause 1, that nothing in the scheme would apply to any product in so far as it is produced outside the area to which the scheme applies. It seems to me that there is a contradiction in the Bill, between the position of the producer, who may live anywhere, and the product, which is only a regulated product if it is produced within the scheduled area. May I ask the Minister to consider another case, that of Cheshire cheese? The Cheshire farmer producing the cheese has a market in Lancashire, and obviously in preparing a scheme for this you will include Cheshire in Lancashire in order to rope in all producers of regulated products. We have been told that, outside the boundaries of Cheshire there are little pockets, as in Staffordshire, where Cheshire cheese is produced. It seems to me that it is going to be very difficult for the Minister to get a scheme in respect of Cheshire cheese to deal with farmers not only in Lancashire, where it is a regulated product, but in Cheshire and in parts of Shropshire, Wales and a bit of Staffordshire.<br><br>
In order that the scheme should be presented, producers in all these four or five counties or parts of counties would have to come together before they proposed a scheme to the Minister. Let us suppose that they made a successful ring on the map which would show the boundaries, and then you got a stray farmer, say in South Shropshire, who also produced Cheshire cheese. I think that is a point on which we must have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0588">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1183</span>
more definite information before it is possible to proceed. It goes to the heart of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is getting unnecessarily warmed up. You cannot imagine any sensible body of producers of Cheshire cheese which did not consider these things. You must give these people credit for having some little knowledge as to the production of their own commodity. I have listened time after time to deputations from Cheshire Members about Cheshire cheese and I am sure that my predecessor did so, and my successor will, and every time they have brought this point up. The trade knows all about it and will take care that the scheme covers it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel RUGGLES-BRISE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quite follow, but the Minister does not seem to realise what a great difficulty is going to arise in the formation of the schemes. You have perhaps to go to every one of these counties to be quite certain that you have reached in each area every producer of that particular product. Suppose that you have neglected half a dozen, it may be in Warwickshire. Is there any power in the Bill to deal with that? I fear there is not, and producers will be able, under the Bill, to sell their products wholly at will when the scheme comes into operation, as they can to-day. If the Minister can assure me I am wrong I shall have my mind very much at rest, but I do</span></p>
