Clause 7.</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
—(Consumers' committees and committee of investigation.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p>(1) The Minister shall, immediately after any scheme approved by him comes into force, appoint a committee (hereafter in this section referred to as "a consumers' committee"), which shall be charged with the duty of considering, and reporting to the Minister on, the effect of the scheme, and any complaints made as to the effect of the scheme, on consumers of the regulated product.</p>
<p>Every consumers' committee shall consist of a chairman and of not less than six other members, who shall be such persons as appear to the Minister, after consultation with the Board of Trade and, as to one member, with the Co-operative Union, to represent the interests of such consumers as aforesaid.</p>
<p>(2) The Minister shall, immediately after the scheme first approved by him comes into force, appoint a committee (hereafter in this section referred to as "a committee of investigation") consisting of a chairman and four other members, which shall be charged with the duty, if the Minister in any case so directs, of considering, and reporting to the Minister on, any report made by a consumers' committee and any complaint made to the Minister as to the operation of any scheme which, in the opinion of the Minister, could not be considered by a consumers' committee under the last foregoing subsection.</p>
<p>(3) The members of every committee appointed under this section shall be appointed for such period and subject to such conditions as may be determined by the Minister, and the meetings and procedure of every such committee shall be regulated in accordance with directions issued by the Minister, and, for the purpose of enabling any such committee to consider any matter which it is their duty under this section to consider, the board administering the scheme to which the matter relates shall furnish the committee with such accounts and other information as the committee requires.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1796</span>
<p>(4) If a committee of investigation reports to the Minister that any provision of a scheme or any act or omission of a board administering a scheme is contrary to the interest of consumers of the regulated product, or is contrary to the interest of any persons affected by the scheme and is not in the public interest, the Minister, if he thinks fit so to do after considering the report and consulting the Board of Trade—
<ol>
<li>may by order make such amendments in the scheme as he considers necessary or expedient for the purpose of rectifying the matter;</li>
<li>may by order revoke the scheme;</li>
<li>in the event of the matter being one which it is within the power of the board administering the scheme to rectify, may direct that board to rectify the matter, and, if the directions are not complied with, may by order make such amendments in the scheme as he considers necessary for securing that the directions will be complied with, and in particular may by such amendments provide that the board shall, for such period as may be specified in the amendments, be composed wholly or partly of persons nominated by the Minister:</li></ol></p>
<p>Provided that, before taking any action under this subsection, the Minister shall give the board administering the scheme notice of the action which lie proposes to take and shall consider any representations made by the board within fourteen days from the date of the notice.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir DOUGLAS NEWTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, to leave out Sub-section (1).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member deals with his Amendment, may I ask your guidance in regard to my Amendment to leave out Clause 7? Should not my Amendment come before any discussion on Clause 7?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, that is an unnecessary Amendment. I shall put the Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill," and that will be the opportunity for the hon. Member to object to the Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We may discuss the Clause for a couple of days and then decide to omit it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be a different Clause after the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. NEWTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I observe that since I put my Amendment on the Order Paper the Minister of Agriculture has tabled a series of Amendments to this Clause, some of which were only handed in yesterday, and it is a little difficult to assess the effect they have on the Clause.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1797</span>
It would be a convenience to the Committee if the Minister explained the effect of his proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The MINISTER of AGRICULTURE (Dr. Addison)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member for Cambridge (Sir D. Newton) for his courteous suggestion, and I will explain as well as I can the series of Amendments that I propose to move. The fact that some of them were put down rather late is not due to any lack of good will, but to the fact that there has been the Easter Recess and that they have been the subject of repeated consultations and inquiries. The general effect of the Amendments is to try to meet what I felt were sound points of criticism on the Clause during the Second Reading Debate. They relate to the machinery of the Clause and to the Schedule of the Bill which deals with any amendment of a scheme. In the first place, so far as the provisions in Subsection (1) of this Clause are concerned, one material criticism was that there was an elaborate complication of committees which may be unnecessary, and in order to meet that objection, which I thought had some force behind it, the scheme, under the Amendments I have tabled, now is that there shall be one general consumers' committee which shall be charged with the general business indicated in Sub-section (1). There might be a large number of <i>ad hoc</i> committees, inexperienced committees, which would not do the work very well, and I felt that it would be much better to have a committee of the right kind gradually gathering experience and that it should be an authoritative body rather than a number of separate <i>ad hoc</i> committees. Therefore, my Amendments to Sub-section (1) are designed to substitute one authoritative body for a large number of different committees.<br><br>
Another material criticism of the Clause was that as it stood it might give the Minister power to alter a board or make amendments in a scheme and force them upon producers against their will. That criticism rests upon two points. First, the way in which you would deal with a complaint which might be established as a sound complaint and, secondly, how to give effect to an amendment of a scheme, which may be necessary in the case of a sound complaint, carrying along the producers with it. That
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1798</span>
obviously entailed a reconsideration of the machinery for making amendments in schemes, and, therefore, a series of Amendments to the First Schedule is necessary in consequence of the Amendments which I am proposing in this Clause.<br><br>
It is not necessary to go over the machinery of the Clause; the point is that when a complaint is made and it is found by the investigating committee to be a <i>bona fide</i> complaint, it requires to be attended to. It is quite evident that under paragraph (<i>c</i>) of Sub-section (4) you may have a complaint coming from a body of producers as well as from a body of consumers. It may come from merchants, or dealers, or distributors: the investigating committee may find that producers as well as consumers have been dealt with unfairly. Therefore, an Amendment is necessary, and I am proposing an Amendment to the machinery of the Schedule in order to deal with this point. Of course, a scheme may be bad and the power to revoke may be necessary; but the particular complaint is that the Minister himself might, under paragraph (<i>c</i>), put in a new board, which is against the spirit and intention of the Bill. There was this further consideration, that if this new board lost money, the producers might suffer loss, and, therefore, it was necessary that the liquidating provisions should be altered accordingly. I have decided to scrap paragraph (<i>c</i>) altogether, except the first few lines. I propose to abandon the Minister's power to put in a new board, but it is necessary to investigate any complaint, and therefore hon. Members will see that in my Amendment I am proposing to leave out the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"direct that board to rectify the matter, and, if the directions are not complied with, may by order make such amendments in the scheme as he considers necessary for securing that the directions will be complied with, and in particular may by such amendments provide that the board shall, for such period as may be specified in the amendments, be composed wholly or partly of persons nominated by the Minister."</p></blockquote>
and to insert the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"by order direct the hoard to take such steps to rectify the matter as may be specified in the order, and thereupon it shall be the duty of the board forthwith to comply with the order."</p></blockquote>
I will read paragraph (<i>c</i>) as it will stand with my proposed Amendment. The Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0896">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1799</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"in the event of the matter being one which it is within the power of the board administering the scheme to rectify, may by order direct the board to take such steps to rectify the matter as may be specified in the order, and thereupon it shall be the duty of the board forthwith to comply with the order."</p></blockquote>
That means that in the case of a complaint from an individual producer, which is proved, the board may be directed to amend the scheme in regard to that individual producer. The board would have the power to put the matter right. The Amendment covers that eventuality. In order to secure that any Orders of the Minister, which will only be made after a complaint has been investigated And proved—and in this particular case the Order of the Minister is limited by instructions to the one matter which is proved to be wrong—I have put down an Amendment to safeguard against Any action of an arbitrary Minister like myself, who is apparently suspected by everybody. Hon. Members will see by my proposed Amendment that:
<br><blockquote><p>"(i) every order made under paragraph (<i>a</i>) or paragraph (<i>c</i>) of this Sub-section shall, as soon as may be after it is made, be laid before each House of Parliament, and if either House, within the next subsequent twenty days on which that House has sat after any such order is laid before it, resolves that the order shall be annulled, the order shall thenceforth be void, but without prejudice to anything previously done thereunder or to the making of a new order; and"</p></blockquote>
You will see by this that, wherever the Minister amends a scheme or directs a board to rectify a wrong, his order must be laid before Parliament. That, I think, meets a. very considerable part of the objection which was taken to the Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister explain the consequential Amendment, on page 1232, which reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"() In considering for the purpose of this Act whether any person represents the interests of consumers of any product, or whether any provision of a scheme or any act or omission of the board administering a scheme is contrary to the interests of consumers of any product, regard shall be had to the interests of persons who purchase the product, or commodities produced wholly or partly therefrom, for their own consumption or use and not to the interests of persons who purchase the product, or such commodities as aforesaid, for the purpose of any trade or industry carried on by them"?</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1800</span>
It seems to introduce powers of a far-reaching kind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very much obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for putting that point. It was raised to me in the form of the question as to who was a consumer. For instance, take the classic case of hops. The consumer of hops is a person who drinks beer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. LAW</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are no hops in beer now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Assuming that there are hops in beer, the person who drinks the beer is the consumer of hops, so far as the word is ordinarily understood. It would be absurd if every man who drank a glass of beer were empowered to bring an action against a hop board because of something it had done in marketing its hops. At the same time, a man who buys hops for manufacturing purposes can make his own bargain with the hop growers, just as a man who buys any other commodity for manufacturing purposes—fruit, for example, for making into jam. He is not a consumer in the ordinary sense, and he does not represent the consumers. He is a manufacturer or a trader. Clearly, those manufacturers and traders are not intended to be covered by the word "consumer." What it means, and what I intended it to mean, is the person who buys the goods to use for ordinary consumption. Therefore, those words referred to by the right hon. Gentleman govern the definition—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Govern the whole Act!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. They govern the definition of "consumer."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is a member of a co-operative society a trader or a consumer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A member of a co-operative society who buys at a shop is clearly a consumer. He buys butter at the shop to eat in his house. The Amendment says:
<br><blockquote><p>"In considering, for the purpose of this Act, whether any person represents the interests of consumers of any product, or whether any provision … [of a board] is contrary to the interests of the consumers of any product, regard shall be had to the interests of persons who purchase the product."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0897">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1801</span>
That is to say, the <i>bona fide</i> consumer, purchasing wholly or partly for consumption or use, and "the interests of persons who purchase the product" not for any trade or industry. Let us say a cattle dealer, or a maltster; they would not be consumers within the meaning of this definition. The consumers would be the persons who buy the meat or the beer. If the maltster, or the brewer, or the cattle dealer want to bring a complaint against the board, the avenue of complaint is the committee of investigation set up in the Bill.<br><br>
It will be seen that there are two committees of investigation, one in respect to consumers as such. Therefore, we have to define consumers, in order to try to clear the way, and avoid overlapping between the two sorts of bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major COLFOX</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where in this scheme of things do the co-operative societies come in? The right hon. Gentleman has just said that members of a co-operative society are consumers. Of course, it is obvious. But co-operative societies seem to me not only consumers, according to his definition, but distributors, people who buy commodities for the purpose of trading and not for the purpose of consumption. Therefore, tie co-operative societies apparently come in in two capacities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is an Amendment on this point, and we shall get down to the question during the discussion. But clearly the members of cooperative societies are consumers. There can be no doubt about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major COLFOX</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The societies are not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and gallant Member allow me to finish my sentence? The members of co-operative societies are organised bodies of consumers. They are nothing else. They would be entitled to elect a committee to represent them, as a body of consumers and the committee would be competent to bring a complaint on their behalf under this Bill. That is sound sense. If the Co-operative Wholesale Society had a complaint as traders, in the course of the conduct of their trade or business, and not in connection with consumers, then that would come under the committee of investigation, but the ordinary co-operative society with its
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1802</span>
local membership is clearly a consumers' organisation and, as such, must be entitled to have its complaints attended to. It was in order to prevent overlapping between the two series of complaints that it was necessary to define the class of persons who would be entitled to bring complaints before the consumers' committee, and that is the purpose of this Amendment.<br><br>
Perhaps I might now refer to the machinery which we propose to set up in the Schedule where we deal with amendments. The first paragraph of the First Schedule, Part II, would disappear altogether and its place would be taken by the rather more elaborate machinery contained in the following words:
<br><blockquote><p>"1. An amendment of a scheme may be submitted by the board to, and approved by, the Minister in accordance with the following provisions of this paragraph, namely:—
<ol>
<li>an amendment may be submitted to the Minister—</li>
<ol>
<li>if the amendment has previously been published in the prescribed manner to all registered producers; and</li>
<li>in a case where a poll is demanded in accordance with the following provisions of this paragraph on the question whether the amendment shall be submitted to the Minister, if a poll on that question has been taken and the result thereof shows that the requisite majority of registered producers has voted in favour of the submission of the amendment;</li></ol>
<li>for the purpose of this paragraph a poll may within the prescribed time from the publication of the amendment as aforesaid be demanded by the prescribed number or the prescribed proportion, as the case may be, of the registered producers, and the provisions of the scheme relating to the manner of taking the initial poll shall apply to any poll taken under this paragraph;</li>
<li>where an amendment is duly submitted to the Minister as aforesaid the provisions of Sub-sections (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of Section one of this Act shall apply with respect to the am.3ndment as they apply with respect to a scheme, subject to the following modifications of the said Sub-section (7), namely,—</li>
<ol>
<li>the words 'is satisfied that the amendment will conduce to the more efficient operation of the scheme' shall be substituted for the words 'is satisfied that the scheme will conduce to the more efficient production and marketing of the regulated product'; and</li>
<li>except in a case where the Minister is required to direct a public
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0898">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1803</span>
inquiry to be held under the provisions of proviso (<i>a</i>) to the said Sub-section (5), the provisions requiring the draft to be before Parliament and the approval of the draft by each House of Parliament before the Minister approves a scheme shall not apply;</li></ol>
<li>for the purpose of this paragraph the expression 'the requisite majority' means—</li>
<ol>
<li>not less than two-thirds of the total number of registered producers voting on the poll; and</li>
<li>registered producers who are capable of producing not less than two-thirds of the quantity of the regulated product which all the registered producers voting on the poll are capable of producing.</li></ol></ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>2. If a demand for a poll on the question whether a scheme shall be revoked is made to the board in the prescribed manner and by the prescribed number or the prescribed proportion, as the case may be, of the registered producers, the board shall forthwith cause a poll of the registered producers to be taken on that question, and the provisions of the scheme relating to the manner of taking the initial poll shall apply accordingly, and if the result of the poll shows that there have voted in favour of the revocation of a scheme—
<ol>
<li>more than half the total number of registered producers voting on the poll; and</li>
<li>registered producers who are capable of producing more than half the quantity of the regulated product which all the registered producers voting on the poll are capable of producing;</li></ol>
the board shall, as soon as practicable after the declaration of the result of the poll, communicate the result thereof to the Minister, and the Minister shall thereupon by order revoke the scheme:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Provided that without the consent of the board, no poll shall be taken under this paragraph within two years from the date of the declaration of the result of the initial poll, or within the prescribed period from the date of the declaration of the result of any previous poll taken under this paragraph.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>3. For the purpose of the last two foregoing paragraphs the expression 'prescribed' means prescribed by the scheme."</p></blockquote>
We put this forward with a view to meeting the objections which have been lodged. How it will work will be, without going into details, that Amendments made under Clause 7 will have to be published to all the registered producers, so that they would know in the first place what the Amendments were. The next thing is, that a poll could be demanded on an Amendment. If the Amendment was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1804</span>
desired by two-thirds of the registered producers, it would then be submitted to the Minister, and the Minister would publish it in the "London Gazette" and hear objections. He will then have to have an inquiry into it, and the procedure will be more or less as indicated before. If there are no objections, then the Amendment will be put into an Order, which will be laid before Parliament and dealt with by Parliament, as my Amendment prescribes. What it really comes to is, that any Amendment will have to be published; there might have to be an opportunity to the producers to register their objections to that Amendment, land the Minister would have to have an inquiry into it. If the producers say, "We will not have this at all; we will revoke the scheme," the producers can revoke the scheme by a poll of not more than one-half of the producers. If it is unpopular, it can be revoked by a majority of producers against it, even a majority of one.<br><br>
I am sorry to have taken rather a long time in explaining these proposals, but I have made a <i>bona fide</i> attempt to meet the objections. I think we have introduced machinery which will secure that where an amendment is more or less trivial and ordinary, and nobody objects, it will be made by laying the Order before Parliament. It will be published, and registered producers will have an opportunity of objecting. In the case of an objection, the other procedure can apply. The power of the Minister to substitute a new board is taken away altogether, and the old board is directed to rectify the wrong. This procedure would be open. Anybody aggrieved by an action which ought to be rectified, that is to say, any person, could bring an action against the board to rectify the wrong and could get damages. Otherwise, if it dealt with a body of people, the Minister could bring a case against the board and would instruct the board to rectify the wrong. Finally, if the wrong was not righted at all, the Minister must have power to revoke the scheme. I hope the Committee will bear in mind the implications of this rather, if I may call it so, bold proposal. What are we doing? We are going to create bodies of producers with immense powers with regard to the marketing of their goods, and it might be the case that the producers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0899">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1805</span>
would enter into arrangements with other parties that would be very unfair to the rest of the community. Therefore, we must have some machinery for dealing with and hearing any complaints. It is absolutely vital that that should be so. I cannot see Parliament agreeing to setting up what would be like a food trust, without some such control as I have referred to.<br><br>
I want to call the attention of the Committee to complaints that have arisen in the course of our earlier discussions. From time to time I have been pressed by hon. Members who wanted to know whether distributors would have a place on the board and how the marketing authority would operate. I think the hon. Member for Holland-with-Boston (Mr. Blindell), who had a question on this subject on the Paper yesterday—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My constituency is affected, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will take his case as an illustration. He raised the case of the Spalding municipality and proposals affecting a market. There are a hundred and one possibilities of different parties in such a case who might feel, in the course of time, that the proceedings of a board were objectionable or unfair, and you must have machinery for investigating those complaints. That is quite evident, and is what the investigation committee is for. Then there is another point, with regard to the "exempted producer." Vie have been asked about the man who has, say, a milk-round, and whether he will be required by the board to do things. You must give protection to a producer of that kind, who ought to be an exempted producer. You must give him a chance of having his complaint heard, and of saying that the exemptions are not fair or not comprehensive enough. Numberless instances have been given in the course of our proceedings, where objection might be raised to an action of the board, and it is perfectly evident that we must have in the machinery some arrangement for dealing with complaints, for hearing them, and for making good the verdict after the complaints have been properly considered. I have done my level best, and we have taken an infinity of trouble over this matter, to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1806</span>
meet the general objections. I think the scheme is a fair one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can allow questions to the Minister, but I cannot allow a general discussion. I have allowed the Minister to explain the Clause, because that may influence the moving and the wording of Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that you will allow me, not to discuss the merits of the proposals, but to see how the Committee stand. These Amendments, as the right hon. Gentleman says, only appeared on the Blue Paper yesterday. They were put down on Friday. They fundamentally change the character of this Clause and make such a substantial alteration in the scheme of the Bill as originally introduced that they call for very serious consideration. I do not say that they are not concessions to the objections that have been taken to the general scheme. The position is extremely difficult, because Members of Parliament when dealing with Bills of this kind consult outside persons, and it gives us very short time for consultation in dealing with this Clause, with such a drastic series of Amendments and changes as are embodied in what the right hon. Gentleman has outlined. It gives us very little time to consider the position.<br><br>
May I take it that this, briefly, is what the Minister now proposes? I ask to be corrected if I am wrong, otherwise misunderstandings will occur when we come to the Amendments. Briefly, instead of the series of committees and powers provided in Clause 7, as originally drafted, he proposes one consumers' committee, a permanent standing committee, to which the consumers, as defined in his new definition of consumers, which he proposes to insert, will have to make representations. That permanent committee will be a sort of consumers' council, through whom the complaints against the action of the board from the consumers' point of view will have to come. Secondly, he proposes to set up one other permanent committee, namely, a semi-judicial committee, to hear the complaints that are brought up through the consumers' committee, many of which, no doubt, the consumers' committee will have sifted, rejected, and marshalled. That committee will not only investigate the complaints from the consumers' com-

mittee but will have the far more responsible task of dealing with reports brought by individuals in their own capacity as consumers, and, say, exempted producers, or people who think they ought to be exempted, market authorities, traders, auctioneers, and the like. Am I right so far?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, except in one respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This committee will have to do all the work of investigating and going through the consumers' complaints which come through the organised committee and other complaints in a miscellaneous way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The statement is correct, and the right hon. Gentleman's version is also correct, except in one respect. There may have to be one committee for Scotland as well as one for England, and in the case of a joint board, it is conceivable that there will be a joint committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gather that there will be a consumers' committee for Scotland and an investigation committee for Scotland, but we will take them as one for the purpose of discussion. This investigation committee is virtually an advisory committee of the Minister, but I understand that in his new scheme it is not to have the power of effecting anything. The only people who can effect anything are the producers' boards, who may accept the recommendations of the investigation committee. If they fail to do so, the Minister can impose on the board the changes proposed by the investigation committee and rejected by the producers' committee, but he can only do that if he gets a Resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think it is to lie on the Table. I do not think it is actually an affirmative Resolution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister is capable of imposing a recommendation of his advisory committee, for that is what the investigation committee is, on an unwilling board, both Houses of Parliament will have their say. I gather that that is the complete scheme as Clause 7 will be, except for the changes in the actual functions of the board.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1808</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Except in one respect. If the producers say, "We do not want this scheme, as amended," they can revoke it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They can revoke it on their own initiative, and the Minister is not able to compel them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He cannot compel them to go on with something which they do not want to do. I gather that the new Schedule machinery, although it is closely linked with Clause 7, deals not so much with the matters that we shall be discussing in Clause 7, but with the kind of amendments in the working of a scheme which the board want to be adopted, as the result of experience in working. It would be for the convenience of the Committee if, while we are discussing the Amendments to Clause 7, we could leave that particular matter over until the Schedule, otherwise we may get mixed up. We are, however, grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving his explanation of the Schedule. I have done my best to summarise the Minister's statement and the Amendments on the Order Paper, but there is still some considerable doubt as to the whole of this scheme. The right hon. Gentleman, in his concluding remarks, 'talked about the danger of great food trusts, and things of that kind. It is absolutely impossible in the circumstances of this country—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must not discuss the merits of the proposal now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ORMSBY-GORE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We on this side of the Committee are still very reluctant to support certain parts of the Bill, but we support the whole scheme on the ground that it is in the interests of the producers and will help them to get better prices. That is our object.</span></p>

We fear that we are building a big engine and that there will not be enough steam to work it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Bill provides, and the Consumers' Council Bill provides, that where machinery is made in any other Act for dealing with complaints, the machinery of that Act will be applied, so that there can be no overlapping. The machinery in this Bill is entirely confined to complaints arising out of the actions of the boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major COLFOX</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has put up what amounts to a completely new Clause. Might I respectfully suggest that you should allow a Second Reading Debate on the new Clause before we come to the Amendments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that would save the time of the Committee. The points are clearly divided. The first Amendment deals with the consumers' committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Was the right hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Ormsby-Gore) right when he asked the Minister whether there would be only one investigation committee and not one for each scheme? If the right hon. Gentleman was right, are there Amendments dealing with that point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There always was one main investigation committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One main, and only one?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Only one. The Clause, Sub-section (2), says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister shall appoint a committee … of investigation."</p></blockquote>
We shall come to the merits of that, later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has left out certain words:
<br><blockquote><p>"… immediately after any scheme approved by him comes into force …"</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not make any difference to the fact. Those words were a little ambiguous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir JOSEPH LAMB</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is to be a permanent committee, we are told. What definition is the right hon. Gentleman putting in with regard to the, word "permanent"? The word can be read in many ways. Are the members of this committee to be life members, or what
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1810</span>
is to be the period of service? These points are important, because we are told that we are to set up only one permanent committee. If there is to be only one, it may be that some member of it may turn out to be a crank, or he may be incompetent in regard to some section of the community, and I should like some means of removing him, if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not propose to make sinecures. You will not have <i>ad hoc</i> separate committees for each separate thing. As to how the members will be changed, that is dealt with in Subsection (3).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. LAMB</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then it is not permanent?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major COLFOX</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sub-section (3) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The members of every committee."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There will be a committee of investigation, and then there may be one for Scotland and one for England.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. NEWTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are obliged to the Minister for the courteous way in which he accepted the suggestion that he should explain the implications of his new proposals. I think that the alterations which he proposes to make will tend, on the whole, to bring the Bill more into line with the suggestions which we have offered on the Second Reading of the Bill and in Committee. He is defining consumers and the persons who make complaints, and providing that they shall not be frivolous or unreasonable complaints. He is limiting the powers of his successors and himself in certain directions. The Amendments are far reaching, but I am sure that some of them will receive the support of the Committee on this side.<br><br>
This Clause is one of the most important in the Bill, and we must give it our closest attention. Under Sub-section (1), immediately the scheme comes into operation, the Minister has to set up a consumers' committee. This committee is set up to consider and report upon the scheme to the Minister of Agriculture, and to take into account any complaints that are made about the scheme. It is to consist of a chairman and six members. The Minister did not tell us whether his revised scheme would be constituted in the same way, but I observe that in the original scheme the Board of Trade and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0902">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1811</span>
the Co-operative Union are to be consulted. Why is consultation limited to these two bodies? In the second step, the Minister sets up a committee to catch a committee; this is the committee of investigation, with a chairman and four members. Their immediate duty is to consider and report to the Minister on any complaints which are made by the consumers' committee. I am not clear, from the explanation given by the Minister, whether he still reserves to himself the power to fling out any member or any of these committees, because in the original proposals he reserved to himself the power to regulate the procedure of these committees and to govern their personnel. As proposed, it will entirely rest with the individual idiosyncrasies of the Minister as to how long a member shall serve, and as to what rules and regulations shall govern his work while he is a member. It is not clear how far the Minister's powers will be curtailed under his new proposal in regard to service on these committees.<br><br>
These points and the host of queries to which they very naturally give rise in regard to the conditions and tenure of office, and to questions of patronage and of pay and emoluments of members who serve on the committees, are relatively minor points when considered against the general question of principle involved in the Clause. The point really at issue under Sub-section (1) is whether it is desirable or necessary that a committee should be appointed. That is the big question for us to consider. What is the justification for all this machinery, all this expenditure, and all these inquisitorial methods? I am fully aware that the Minister of Agriculture has a hard row to hoe, and that he has to meet the wishes of his followers, who are rightly or wrongly suspicious—I think wrongly—that agriculturists are out to exploit the rest of the community. I hardly think that that is a belief which has any sound foundation, in view of the wages and returns of agriculturists and those who work for them, which are the lowest hi any field of production. It can hardly be said that agriculturists and those associated with them are exploiting the community. It may be said with more truth that they are being exploited by the rest of the community.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1812</span>
The Bill provides for the regulation of the marketing procedure of producers within a defined area of production, which may be a national area or a local area, and it confers wide, drastic powers hitherto unheard of against such producers and against no other persons. I would emphasise that point. The whole of these drastic powers, severe as they are, are against the producers and not against any other persons. The Bill does not attempt to regulate the purchase price of a commodity within a defined area. Indeed, how can it regulate the price? It does not in any way restrict the volume of foreign imports, and whatever control there may be in regard to the regulated product in that defined area on the producer, it can surely have no effect as long as there are no similar powers against the foreign producer.<br><br>
Why is it necessary to set up a consumers' committee just to deal with agricultural producers? The agricultural producer does not make price-rings. We know that in other commodities price-rings, even international price-rings, may be made, but so far as the agricultural producer is concerned, there is no price-ring for tomatoes, or cucumbers, or grapes; yet it is proposed to set up a body such as this consumers' committee, with great inquisitorial powers, with powers of interference, and power to call for books and papers—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. NEWTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I venture to think that they will have these powers, or that the result of their complaints will be that some other committee will have the power to call for books and make these inquisitorial investigations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member usually speaks very much to the point, but he now seems to be making a Second Reading speech. In any case, I suggest that his statements are not correct so far as they apply to this Clause or to any other committee which is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount WOLMER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman look at Sub-section (3)?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not apply to the consumers' committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount WOLMER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, to every committee.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0903">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1813</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. NEWTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I have overstated the case, I am sorry to have misled the Committee, but it must be admitted from a, close consideration of this Clause that there will be powers of investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is representing that this committee will go into the performances of individual farmers. They will investigate complaints against the board. That is quite a different thing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. NEWTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be impertinent and press my point too much, but I have my point of view on this matter, and I am not wholly satisfied. It appears to me that there is either no case for the setting up of this committee—which is the proper view to take —or it is a matter of impending events casting their shadows before, and that Members on the opposite side are proposing the abandonment of Free Trade.<br><br>
I am prepared to admit that there is a case under Sub-section (1) of this Clause for a committee if and when you proceed with a policy of dealing, by regulation or licence or in any other way, with foreign imports. In those cases, there might be rings made by the producers to the detriment of the consumers, but there is a real distinction between the case now put before us and the case which might exist if those altered circumstances arose. The restriction of sales, at which this particular Clause is aimed, might operate very differently in the case of commodities, the importation of which was restricted or forbidden. I have always given to the Minister, and I hope I shall always be able to do so, full credit for a genuine desire to help the agricultural community, but he is bringing in a Clause of this kind in order to placate certain of his followers. He is battling against almost, insuperable odds, for he must realise that this Clause is not needed as things are at the present time.<br><br>
The real problem will not be, and is not, how to keep prices down under this Bill, but to keep prices at such a level as will give a reasonable return to the 400,000 agricultural occupiers and the 700,000 agricultural workers and their families who are dependant upon them. It is a question of keeping prices at such a level that there will be a living for those engaged in the industry. Under
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1814</span>
this Clause two types of organisation are being visualised—there is the pool type, which is to deal with potatoes, milk, and hops—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is getting away from his own Amendment. We are discussing only the consumers' committee on this Amendment, and the necessity for it. The hon. Member is proposing to leave out Sub-section (1), and he must stick closely to that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. NEWTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I bow to your Ruling, but the Amendment raises the whole general issue. Either you want the committee or you do not. In my opinion, you do not, and I have to make my case by pointing out what the effect of the Bill is in a general way. That is why I am rather wide in the arguments I put forward. There are two types of organisation under the Bill. There is first the pool type, which contemplates setting up an organisation to deal with large-scale production, such as milk, potatoes, and hops. But the Bill does not tell us how you are going to deal with the market which is burdened with huge surpluses in certain cases of home-produced articles. You may be able to deal with that, but you will have no control over the large sources of supply from overseas.<br><br>
The other type is the non-trading, regulatory type of organisation, which will be set up under this Bill, and will deal with the technique of marketing, grading, packing, and so on. There is a very good case for this, but I cannot see where this committee's machinery is required to deal with that side of the Bill. We ought to have more information as to the cost of this proposal. Obviously, inspectors will be required. You cannot investigate complaints without machinery, and machinery is costly. We ought to have some indication of what these inspectors will cost. I have said enough to show that I am justified, from the point of view which we on this side take on this Bill, in moving the rejection of Subsection (1) of the Clause. It is for the Minister to make out a case to show that unless he has this committee the public may be exploited. There is no indication of the public being exploited, or of the possibility of the public being ex-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0904">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1815</span>
ploited, so long as an unrestricted flow of commodities produced overseas is allowed to enter our ports.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting dialogue between the Minister and the right hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Ormsby-Gore), which arose from an endeavour to explain the new set of Amendments which has been tabled by the Minister, and I should like to join in the protest against the way in which the Bill is being remodelled from day to day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not on that point now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am going to speak strictly to the Amendment, but I only wish to join in the protest that has been made upon that point. The Minister quite properly spoke of the consumers' committee along with the investigation committee, for the two cannot be dissociated, and we ought to nip in the bud the progress from one committee to another right through this Bill, and the way to do it is to prevent the institution of this consumers' committee. I am a keen supporter of organised marketing, like all my colleagues on these benches, but that does not mean that we are going to assent to the particular proposals in this Bill. The consumers' committee is to be composed of a chairman and six members, and it is set up for the purpose of reporting on the effect of a scheme and on any complaints from consumers. Each member will be a paid official. It will have a staff of inspectors and clerks, typists and messengers. You will have a department within a department. That is the proposal in the Bill.<br><br>
My contention is that although the Minister by his new proposals has limited the number of consumers' committees to two, one for England and one for Scotland, we are still to have consumers' committees with wide and drastic powers. If this Bill is to be a success, it must be simplified. The machinery is far too complicated. The Bill is becoming overloaded. As to the necessity for these consumers' committees, my hon. Friend has put a very pertinent point—namely, that there is already before the House a Bill setting up a consumers' council. If there is to be a consumers' council, which is to be competent to deal with every inquiry
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1816</span>
which may come before such a council, there is no necessity for setting up these consumers' committees under this Bill. If it is the Government's intention to proceed with the Consumers' Council Bill, it will be able to deal with all the complaints under this Bill.<br><br>
Let me deal with what I regard as the chief protection for consumers. Hon. Members above the Gangway would like to regulate imports, but I believe that the consumers' main and chief protection is the free flow of imports from abroad. In those circumstances, the consumers at home can never be exploited. If you have a system of Free Trade—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must not get away from the Amendment. We cannot have a general discussion on the Clause now. The point is whether these consumers' committees are to be set up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to develop that argument, but I think I am entitled to put forward considerations which in my judgment render this Clause unnecessary. It is the system of free imports which prevents the exploitation of the home consumer. I suggest to the Minister that he has another, an easier and simpler, method of protecting the home consumer than that which is proposed. He has taken power to appoint two members to each board. What are they to do? Are they there for the purpose of encouraging the board, or of instructing the board? Whatever may be their duties, has it not occurred to the Minister to ask them to protect the interests of the consumers and report direct to the Minister? If they are aware of any complaints, surely that is a direct and quick method of bringing them to the notice of the Minister. On the other hand, how is the consumers' committee to operate? How is it to know what the board is doing? Is it to wait until the annual report of the board is issued before it is to know what they are doing? Is it to have a regular inspection of the accounts of the board, or is it to wait until some consumers make a complaint?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, I suggest that the hon. Member should read the Clause. They cannot act unless a complaint is made. All these imaginations on the part of the hon. Member are entirely vain.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0905">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1817</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have read the Clause, and it is in an endeavour to get some reason out of it that I am making these suggestions. I want to know how the consumers' committee will operate. When a, complaint is made by a consumer, what does the committee do? Does it go to the board and ask to see the accounts and the whole story of the particular transaction, or is it to have power to go to the farmer or to the producer? Will the Minister give us a guarantee that the individual producer will not be molested by the consumers' committee? That is an important consideration for the farmer. He is going to surrender a great deal of his independence, and lie wants to know what more he is going to surrender. I have read the report of the Committee on Co-operation in Scotland, which was published last year, in order to discover whether that Committee made any recommendations to the Minister on the lines of this Bill. I find that they made no such recommendations. After saying that they believe it is possible to reconcile the interests of the producers and consumers, they say:
<br><blockquote><p>"We believe, however, that the greatest safeguard for consumers is the establishment of closer relationships between the organisations of producer and consumers."</p></blockquote>
That is not the proposal in the Bill. They also say:
<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that much of the suspicion which exists on both sides will be dispelled by closer contact and that there is enough common ground between them to make cooperation fruitful, and that machinery could be devised for resolving points of difference."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has had no suggestion from that Committee for the proposals in the Bill, and I fear that, notwithstanding his zeal to devise some scheme which will meet all points of view, he has allowed himself to be overborne by the draftsmen of the Bill. Have they ever been in commerce? Do they know how the board will conduct its business?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I really must protest against these continual aspersions on civil servants who help us with these Bills. I am responsible for the Bill and for the proposals in the Bill; and nobody else. The Parliamentary draftsman has done his best to carry out my instructions, and I object to these most unfair and cowardly aspersions. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1818</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not cowardly!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no call whatever for the remarks of the right hon. Gentleman. I am making no aspersions whatever on the draftsman of the Bill; I am testing the value of the proposals in the Bill. I agree that the draftsman has done his best, but I am testing the Bill from the point of view of business men. When a board is conducting its business, buying and selling and making contracts, and doing it in the face of competition abroad, is it at the same time to run the gauntlet of constant criticism from the consumers' committee and the investigation committee? It is going to make the work of the board extremely difficult. My objections are on the ground of economy, that it is going to impose on the taxpayer a quite unnecessary expense in the constitution and working of these consumers' committees, and, in the second place, that they are unnecessary because we are to have a consumers' council set up by another Bill.<br><br>
In the third place, I think that we should do our best to cut out Whitehall from the administration of the boards. If they are to have any success at all, the less the Minister has to do with them the better. However benign the present holder of the office may be, however suave his manner, anyone who has had any experience of a Government Department knows that it is not he or his successors who will deal with the conduct of these consumers' committees, but that it will be the officials of the Ministry, and with the utmost respect for the Civil Service, and with a knowledge of how faithfully they do their work, I say that those who are in business are best able to manage it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ALPASS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regard this Clause as perhaps the most vital part of the Bill from the standpoint of those who are interested in industrial constituencies. We have to see that the interests of the large body of consumers whom we represent are not jeopardised or prejudiced by this scheme, and we cannot for a moment support any proposal designed to give power to producers to form any scheme to fix prices unless we are satisfied that the interests of the consumers are fully protected. Let me give a little illustration from my own experience. I attended a meeting of dairy farmers—I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0906">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1819</span>
happen to be one myself—to consider the price of milk, in the county of Gloucestershire. We were addressed by a gentleman who holds a position in one of the largest milk combines in the country. I can give his name, but I do not want to do so publicly. The gentleman addressed us in these words: "Gentlemen, your interests as dairy farmers in producing milk, and our interests, are identical. The higher the prices we can give you, the more milk you will produce and the more money you will get; and damn the public." [HON. MEMBERS: "Order!"] That is quite Parliamentary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. NEWTON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What was your reply?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ALPASS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was strictly within the limits of Parliamentary language. There was an actual instance, where this man, who was occupying a very large position of responsibility, was endeavouring in effect to combine with the producers of milk, and had no form of consideration as to how that was going to affect the interests of the consumers. He was trying to range the producers against the large body of people who are buying milk. If that is possible with regard to milk, similar conditions might arise in the marketing of other commodities. The position is not answered by saying that it is going to be altered by the operation of the Consumers' Council Bill, which I understand will work by inquiry into prices that have been charged, that is to say, prices that have been operating. They come in after the exploitation has been carried on, whereas this Clause is to prevent the exploitation beginning, and to see that, while the interests of the producers are fairly dealt with, the interests of the consumers are not going in any way to be unduly affected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member explain how, under the terms of the Bill, exploitation is to be prevented from beginning?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ALPASS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refer the hon. Member to the words of Clause 7:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister shall, immediately after any scheme approved by him comes into force, appoint a committee (hereafter in this Section mferred to as 'a consumers' committee'), which shall be charged with the duty of considering, and reporting to the Minister on, the effect of the scheme."</p></blockquote>

I do not think our Minister would give sanction to a scheme, the operation of which had been reported by the consumers' committee as being prejudicial to the interests of the consumers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He has already given sanction to the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ALPASS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot imagine a responsible Minister agreeing to the scheme against representations that it was going to be harmful to the interests of the consumers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I read this Clause, the consumers' committee is not appointed, nor does it operate, until after the Minister has definitely approved the scheme. So that it cannot consider the scheme until after it has been approved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ALPASS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the scheme would work, practically, in the manner suggested by the hon. Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ALPASS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There must be some power on the part of the Minister to give effect to the consumers' committee's representations if he thinks they ought to carry weight. We are all anxious to see producers with a proper share of the price which is paid by consumers, but we are just as anxious to see that every precaution is taken that consumers shall not have to pay artificially inflated prices. I strongly support this part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel LANE FOX</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The argument of the hon. Member who has just spoken in regards to the consumers' committee does not hold water, because the Clause does not have the effect that he wants it to have of preventing exploitation before it occurs. If he will study the Clause, I think he will see that I am perfectly correct in this. I am obliged to the Minister for the distinct improvement made in the original scheme by the Amendments which he is suggesting. They remove what undoubtedly was a blot on this part of the Bill. I agree with one of my hon. Friends who said that, while foreign imports are not to be restricted, the need for investigation is likely to be very small. Is it necessary for the Minister to have such a lengthy chain of investigation? I quite understand that hon. Gentlemen opposite are naturally suspicious of the operation of these boards and require safeguards for

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1821</span>
the consumers. That is a very natural point of view.<br><br>
The Minister has already reduced the elaboration; might I ask him if it is necessary to have these separate consumers' committees at all? He has the committee of investigation, and if the work is too much, he could always increase the committee as circumstances might require. I suggest that to have this series of investigations must cripple and hamper the initial work of the boards and make it extremely difficult for them to do anything at all. To have before them the constant uncertainty of having to submit to investigation by one body after another, will delay their operations. If a number of boards are set up, their operations will be so restricted by the competition of foreigners, that complaints are likely to be far fewer than the Minister thinks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major COLFOX</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my judgment, the whole of this paragraph is another instance of complete humbug and eye-wash. The Government appear to have the Consumers' Council on the brain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. DUNCAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where do you find it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major COLFOX</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, assuming that that is a, possibility! [<i>Interruption.</i>] Hon. Members opposite are extremely vocal, at times when their views are completely out of order and when hon. Members on this side are trying to express opinions, but they are absolutely "dumb, driven cattle" when they themselves have the opportunity of making speeches. As I was saying, this paragraph is complete humbug, because, in the first instance, consumers' committees in connection with this Bill are absolutely unnecessary. Consequently they will be completely worthless if and when they are set up. There can be no possibility of marketing boards exploiting consumers by putting prices high against them, for the simple reason that the prices of agricultural commodities and products are fixed, and will be fixed, not by these marketing boards, but by the world market price of similar products coming from overseas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BEN RILEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about liquid milk?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major COLFOX</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These consumers' committees are absolute humbug.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not ruled the hon. and gallant Gentleman out of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1822</span>
order, but it is against the rule for an hon. Member to repeat his argument three times.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. DUNCAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a regiment of humbugs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major COLFOX</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not repeated myself. I am putting my point as concisely and as tersely as possible. I leave that point, and come to my next, which is that towards the end of this paragraph, we read that one of the members of this consumers' committee shall be a member of the Co-operative Union. All members of the Co-operative Union are consumers, just as all members of any other political bodies are consumers. The fact that all bodies, whether political or otherwise, must be composed of consumers of food, does not mean that the organised body is itself representative of consumers. I can see absolutely no reason why this one political body should be given representation on the consumers' committee, over the heads of representatives of other political bodies. Why should not the Independent Labour Party, for instance, not have a representative on the consumers' committee; and why not that distinguished party recently formed by the hon. Member for Smethwick (Sir Oswald Mosley), who was at one time Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster? It is pure humbug again, for any purely political body, as the Co-operative Union is, to have representation on a consumers' committee, which in itself is absolutely unnecessary, unrequired, and which cannot function even if it be set up. I strongly support the Amendment to delete this Clause, and to get some sense into this completely rubbishy Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount WOLMER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will press his Amendment to a Division. It is necessary for us to dissociate ourselves entirely from this part of the Bill. I agree with my hon. Friend that a consumers' committee is quite unnecessary, so long as you have free imports and the House of Commons. The House of Commons is the great consumers' committee of the nation. Is it possible that any marketing board could deliberately raise the price on a commodity of which it had control, in an unreasonable way, without hon. Members receiving representations from their constituents? Under the Bill as it stands, the House of Commons and Parliament
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0908">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1823</span>
have complete control. If a marketing board is abusing its powers in any way, the scheme can always be revoked. That is the guarantee that the consumers have that if a marketing board abuses its position, Parliament has its remedy. That is the right way to deal with the matter, and not to appoint all these committees, with powers to pry into the trading concerns of the marketing boards. I should not be in order in discussing the details of Sub-section (3), but when we get to that point I shall challenge the statement of the Minister that these committees have not power to call for the books of the marketing board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that. I said the hooks of individual farmers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount WOLMER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The words are rather wider than that. I must not go into the matter, but if we are defeated on this Amendment, that is a point that we shall be bound to raise. Even at this hour I ask the Minister to reconsider the whole question of these prying committees. It shows want of faith in the opinion of the House of Commons, and it shows a want of faith in the alertness of hon. Members on the Government side as well as on our side. There have been too many of these committees set up in the past, and I want to limit their number in the future. I do not think they will be any real protection to the consumer. Anything that we can do to simplify this Bill will be an improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. CHATER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to say a few words on behalf of the co-operative movement, which I have the honour to represent, and to explain the vital difference that it will make in our attitude towards the Bill if this Amendment is carried. When the Bill was introduced the powers which it gives to the producers of food caused a certain amount of disquiet among the co-operative societies, whose membership is something like 6,000,000. The objection of hon. Members opposite seems to be concentrated against this particular committee, which is the one consumers' committee and protects the consumers. It does not lessen our suspicions of the opposition to this particular Clause, that it is being concentrated against the only machinery which is composed exclusively of consumers, or of the representatives of consumers and for the protection of consumers as such.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1824</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to disabuse the mind of the hon. Member of any idea that we do not want to protect the consumer. We do, but we say that this Clause is unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. CHATER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been pointed out that the Consumers' Council Bill, which is not yet passed, will provide all the necessary protection, but this Measure may pass in front of it. It does not necessarily follow that the Consumers' Council Bill will give us the protection that we may get in this Bill. The activities of the consumers' committee in this Clause are defined and have to be used for a definite purpose. The committee will not roam over all commodities, as will the Consumers' Council. Therefore, it is essential from the point of view of the co-operative movement that we should have this particular Sub-section. If the machinery of the Bill overlaps, I would rather that hon. Members opposite would concentrate on some other part of the overlapping machinery rather than upon this particular Clause. Hon. Members opposite protest that there is no possibility of the exploitation of the consumer, and that they are anxious to avoid exploitation. Then why do they wish to get rid of this Clause, which has been put in for the protection of the consumers? I want to make it clear, as representing the co-operative movement, that in the event of the rejection of this Sub-section, we should have seriously to consider whether we could continue to support the Bill. I hope the Minister will maintain very strongly his position in trying to secure the retention of the Clause, and I hope also that if hon. Members opposite have a sincere desire that this Bill should get through, they will realise the importance of retaining this Sub-section.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major LLOYD GEORGE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am one of those who would like to see this Bill in operation, and because of that desire I suggest to the Minister that the more simple the Bill can be made, the more likely is it to be effective and the more likely are we to be able to refute the charges of its enemies, that there is too much of bureaucracy in every Clause of it. In this connection, there is some substance in the contention that the Bill overlaps the Consumers' Council Bill. This Clause says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister shall, immediately after any scheme approved by him comes into
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0909">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1825</span>
force, appoint a committee (hereafter in this Section referred to as 'a consumers' committee'), which shall be charged with the duty of considering, and reporting to the Minister on, the effect of the scheme, and any complaints made as to the effect of the scheme, on consumers of the regulated product."</p></blockquote>
The Consumers' Council Bill, in Clause 2, says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to the provisions of this Section, it shall be the duty of the council—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(i) to investigate all such questions relating to the production, distribution, supply or price of any commodity, being a commodity with which they are charged by this Section to concern themselves …"</p></blockquote>
The Section with which they are charged to concern themselves relates to "articles of food of general consumption." It seems to me that there is a grave lack of co-ordination between the various Departments. Either there is no need for the Consumers' Council Bill, or there is no need for this 'Clause. I would rather say that there is no need for this Clause. In regard to the remark that has been made that the difference between Clause 7 of this Bill and Clause 2 of the Consumers' Council Bill is that the consumers' council is to stop exploitation after it has taken place, and this Clause is to stop it before it takes place, I submit that that is not so. I do not see how you can stop a thing taking place before it occurs. The words of the Clause are:
<br><blockquote><p>"any complaints made as to the effect of the scheme."</p></blockquote>
You cannot have an effect before the scheme starts. The fewer unnecessary committees we have, the better I shall be pleased. I suggest to the Minister that the Consumers' Council Bill in Clause 2 gives ample protection, and even wider protection, to the consumers than can be got by setting up too many committees in this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. DUNCAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all deeply interested in this Amendment, and it is only right that the criticisms uttered should have been made, so that we may see exactly where we are driving. May I suggest to the last speaker that the Consumers' Council Bill deals with the whole trade of the country as regards the things that are consumed? In this Bill we are setting up marketing boards, and we are going to place in the hands of those boards the greatest power that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1826</span>
has ever been put into the hands of any set of producers in this country. I have had some experience of an organisation consisting of 500,000 men, and I know that once you get a marketing board dealing with the various descriptions of goods that come under this Bill, it will be a very big thing.<br><br>
It is all very well to assume that we are always going to have an overproduction of potatoes, milk, and so on, but let us realise that there may come a time when there will be a shortage. Is there any hon. Member who doubts that, in a time of shortage, the price will rise? It is a question of supply and demand. Is it not reasonable to assume that in such a case there may be complaints from consumers? I do not believe that when this committee is set up it is going to be a committee of "nosey Parkers" who will go round the farming parts of the country trying to rake up complaints. On the other hand, we have to realise that nobody desires the Minister to be a Mussolini. Amendments have been moved to limit his powers, and he has agreed to them. If we are not to concentrate power in the hands of the Minister, we must bring in someone who will be in a position to make inquiry and to allay suspicion. We are giving enormous power to the producer. There may be many reasons, or there may be lack of reasons, for suspicion, but there always will be suspicion on the part of people, when they are buying produce, that they are paying a little too much.<br><br>
I would plead with the Opposition. The production of foodstuffs in this country is in a state of anarchy. I know as well as hon. Members opposite that the farmers and those associated with them are not making fortunes, and we are doing our best through this Bill to help to put them on their feet again and to give them a chance. Judging by the arguments from the other side, it would appear that the last thing that is desired is to get outside the anarchy that exists and to bring order out of chaos. I am anxious to help the farmers to secure a good price for their commodities, and I am anxious to see an increase of the production and the quality, so that they may compete more effectively with imports from abroad. Surely it is not beyond the wit of man to imagine that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0910">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1827</span>
there may be, I will not say that there will be, many instances of complaint. It is only reasonable that the consumers should have this opportunity of making whatever inquiries may be necessary in order that they may be satisfied. There may be nothing in the point, but they will have the satisfaction of some inquiry having been made.<br><br>
I hope that hon. Members on the Opposition benches will not imagine that we are desirous of doing anything wrong to those who are producing the foodstuffs of the country. We are not here to defend the rate of wages of the work-people in agriculture, for it is only a starvation rate of wages. We believe that by this Bill we may enable the producers to get on to a higher plane and to pay higher wages. We are just as anxious to help this along as anybody on the Opposition side. We are not here to cut the throats of the farmers, but to help them. Therefore, I would ask hon. Members on the Opposition side to give us a little more credit for our willingness to be helpful in this matter, and to get order out of anarchy and prosperity instead of bankruptcy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. LAMB</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the charges made against Parliament by outsiders is that there is too much legislation, and if we put this Clause in the Bill, that charge will be justified. This Clause is not necessary, because it will be ineffective. Until you have some control over the major portion of an article which is being consumed, it is no use attempting to put control over a minor portion of that article. Consequently, the control cannot be effective. It would not affect the consumer. I object to any party saying they are out to protect the consumer, for it is the duty of all of us to do that, but in protecting the consumer, we must consider the legitimate rights of the producer. We are setting up this ineffective machinery, and it will be very expensive and a waste of money. It may be said that in the vast expenditure of the country it will not amount to much, but it is in these small items that we have to consider the curtailment of unnecessary expenditure.<br><br>
I must refer a little to the details of the Clause in order to give my reasons for objecting to Sub-section (1). I must,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1828</span>
therefore, refer to some of the later Amendments, and by doing so I hope to be able to help to defeat the whole Clause. My first reason is the time that will be taken up by all the machinery which is to be set up. There are in the Bill two modes of inspection and control. They will take a considerable time. In many of the commodities which will come under consideration prices are not fixed for long periods, and by the time all the paraphernalia of this committee work has been done, prices will have varied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ALPASS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The price of milk is fixed for 12 months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. LAMB</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is only one commodity, but this Bill will not deal only with milk. It would be better if it did deal with only one commodity. We could then deal with it on its merits and, on the experience gained, bring in Bills to deal with other commodities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is now out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. LAMB</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not pursue the point, but I was only replying to an interjection. With regard to the rights of co-operative societies upon this committee, in what capacity does a member of a co-operative society claim that he can sit upon this committee? Does he claim that he can sit there because the members are consumers? We are all consumers, and the co-operative societies cannot represent their members as consumers. They represent them as traders, and they are only one section of the community. It is argued that they represent their members as consumers because they trade only with their members, but that is not a fact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. CHATER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not claimed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. LAMB</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If they traded only with their members, they would close many of their shops. They are, therefore, general traders, and have no greater <i>locus standi</i> on this committee than any other section of traders might have. If the societies represented their members as consumers, they would give consideration to the prices direct to the consumer, but they do not do that. The prices in the co-operative shops are barely below those in any other shops</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0911">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1829</span>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must not go into details of that sort. Assuming we go on with the Clause, we shall come to the discussion of that particular point. The hon. Member is entitled to refer to it, but not to go into details.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. LAMB</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will refer to it in no great detail because it is covered by an Amendment. I hope, however, that we shall not reach that Amendment, because I am trying to make this Bill much more satisfactory by getting this Clause cut out. The co-operative societies are not entitled to be on this committee as consumers, but only as traders, because the advantage they give to their members is not in the reduction of prices to the consumers, but in returning to the members a profit in the form of dividends which have accrued from the members and those who trade with them. Therefore they are traders.<br><br>
Why should we set up machinery to deal with one section of consumed articles only, that is to say, food? If you refer to the index figures of the cost of living, you will find that two figures are given, one relating to general consumption, and one relating to food only; and that for food is very much lower than the other. Why should we under this Bill, before the other Bill is passed —if it ever be passed—deal with one section of consumed articles only? It is unfair and unjust, because the bulk of consumption is of foodstuffs, and the index figure for those is considerably lower than the index figures for general consumption. It is unwise to put in this Bill something that should be dealt with in a comprehensive Measure covering all articles of consumption.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has lost sight of the fundamental scheme of this Bill. We are setting up organisations of producers of food, and we are proposing that these organisations shall have great powers. On that account, this proposal is necessary in this case. When Parliament sets up bodies with very great powers and gives the instructions of these bodies the force of law, which is what we are doing, it is right that we should associate with that grant of immense powers some reasonable machinery for securing that those powers are not abused. When the producers' boards get into operation, they will have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1830</span>
very great powers. They are intended to have very great powers, and we have been discussing for weeks what those powers are. My point is that if Parliament goes out of its way to endow the producers of a necessity of life with these great powers, it is incumbent on Parliament to associate with it some machinery for seeing that those powers are not abused.<br><br>
The classes of persons who might be affected may be either consumers or traders or others who may be concerned with their transactions. This Amendment relates to the first class of persons. It is not simply a matter of waiting until we can deal with imports. There was an important case in Scotland of a great agency that dealt with milk in Glasgow. My right hon. Friend the Lord Privy Seal has often supplied me with details. If there is one thing that the farmers of that region who are promoting the milk co-operative agency are insisting upon, it is that there must be some safeguards for the consumers, because they know that it is to their interest. If they are to increase the consumption of milk and get public confidence in their scheme, they have to enlist the sympathy and the support of the body of consumers, and nothing could be more short-sighted in the interests of the producers themselves than to seek to divorce them and their transactions from some reasonable machinery for securing the safeguarding of the interests of the consumers generally.<br><br>
Any man who thinks carefully over the kind of arrangements which might conceivably be made in a commodity like milk, where it would be a part and parcel of the legitimate and proper marketing of milk that you should have organisations for collecting it, and, if necessary, for cleaning it, and for distributing it on proper lines, will realise that that will mean that you must have more and more a coalescence of producers' and distributors' machinery. It is almost inseparable in the case of an article like milk. Does not that show that you might easily have an alliance between these two interests, as the hon. Member for Central Bristol (Mr. Alpass) indicated? I know of cases where it is actually proposed at the cost of the consumer. We really must, in common fairness to the vast body of people associated with this new scheme, have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1930-1931V000P1I0912">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1831</span>
machinery of this kind so long as it works reasonably. No one wants it to work unreasonably.<br><br>
The hon. and gallant Member for Pembroke (Major Lloyd George) made some very good suggestions affecting the wording of the latter part of Sub-section (1). I am willing to consider with the utmost good will any Amendment affecting the mode of operation, and the time at which the complaints shall be investigated. There is some misunderstanding between my hon. and gallant Friend and some others on this particular point, and I agree that these are matters which are capable of adjustment. I come to the other contention, that we should not have this committee when we have a Consumers' Council Bill. The hon. Member who stressed that point also objects to the Consumers' Council Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. LAMB</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Until you have control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In other words, he does not want it at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. LAMB</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I say that it is no use setting up machinery which will be in: effective. Until you fix prices, it will be no use whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the machinery for dealing with the amendments of a scheme and reviewing grievances is before us, we can deal with it. The only point now is whether we shall have this body investigating these complaints, and it is not material to suggest that there is a Bill before the House setting up a consumers' council. It may have a rough course before it, and it is by no means on the Statute Book yet. You cannot legislate in that way; and, as a matter of fact, it is necessary to provide machinery for separating the two, and that provision is already in this Bill. It is purely machinery to deal with complaints made against the operations of producers' schemes, and I regard it as vital to the Bill. If we are defeated this morning, I shall not leave the matter alone, because I consider that this is absolutely necessary and, moreover, that it is the sensible thing to do. We must
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1832</span>
link up the interests of consumers with those of producers. They are not hostile. I want consumers to be willing to agree that farmers and labourers shall be properly paid; and all suggestions to divorce their interests are entirely wrong and bad statesmanship.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to traverse the arguments that have already been addressed to the Committee—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. ROWSON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shall I be in order in moving, "That the Question be now put"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BLINDELL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am as anxious as anyone to make this a workable Measure, and I am as anxious as the Minister of Agriculture that the consumers' interests should be safeguarded. I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman that producers and consumers should work together in the interests of each other, but the provisions in the Bill do exactly the opposite; they divorce these interests. I suggest that if consumers are represented on the marketing board, you will get co-operation instead of antagonism between the two sections, and such a proposal would meet the support of the entire Committee. You are not going to have a smooth working of the Bill if you have a committee which is watching the operations of the board. If the Bill is left in that form it would be much better to leave it to the Consumers' Council to make the necessary arrangements to safeguard the interests of consumers rather than put this extra machinery in this Bill.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Dr. ADDISON</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Committee do now adjourn."<br><br>
May I say that it grieves me to know that we are not to meet to-morrow afternoon because of the Representation of the People Bill, which is to be taken on the Floor of the House. I understood that it was arranged to meet to-morrow afternoon. I think the House is only going to discuss motor cars to-morrow, but if the Committee objects to meeting to-morrow afternoon, we shall have to agree, although I should have thought that there would be plenty of people to discuss the question of motor cars without us for an hour and a half to-morrow afternoon.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1834</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. C. WILLIAMS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount WOLMER</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The attitude of the Minister is straightforward, and we must thank him for it. There was an agreement, but my hon. Friends desire to take part in the Debate on the Representation of the People Bill, and if the Government insist on taking these important Bills on the Floor of the House, it is impossible for us to meet in Committee. I hope that we shall not meet until Thursday morning.</span></p>
<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>
<p>Committee adjourned at Nine minutes after One o'Clock until Thursday, 23rd April, 1931, at Eleven o'Clock.</p>
