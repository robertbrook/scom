	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Clause, as amended, be added to the Bill."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WATERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. Yesterday when we were adjourning for lunch there was a great misunderstanding between many Members of the Committee with reference to an Amendment which, according to the Chairman's ruling, had not been passed, and which appeared on page 907 of yesterday's Order Paper. Many Members of the Committee thought that Amendment had been dealt with vastly different from the way in which it had been dealt with. The consequence was that the Chairman yesterday ruled out an Amendment which stood in the name of the hon. Member for St. Helens (Mr. Sexton), which was to add a new Sub-section at the end of the new Clause-Seeing that there was a great misunderstanding among the Committee, and in view of the fact that precedents had been created in this Committee with reference to reversing a decision—we do not say through the action of the Chairman—we endeavoured to alter the misunderstanding that had arisen. At this point I wish to make it perfectly clear that the principle of the Clause and its effect are based on the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens. We are anxious to get that Amendment put into the Clause. Seeing that the majority of the Members of the Committee were in agreement and really misunderstood the position, we ask for your ruling, Sir, before we proceed to pass this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the question was put from the Chair yesterday, I am bound to rule that the only question before the Committee and which can be before the Committee is "That the Clause, as amended, be added to the Bill." I very much regret the circumstance, but it is a circumstance which I cannot correct. It is only fair to. say it is much more to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>1054</span>
regretted by reason of the fact that hon. Members will not be able to raise this matter on the Report stage of the Bill, because it deals with the question of finance. If I could possibly, within the Rules of Procedure, correct what you inform me has been an admitted grievance felt by the majority of the Committee, I should be very glad to do so, but I find myself in the position that I cannot. As to the question of precedents, to which the hon. Member referred, that is an entirely different proposition. I have refreshed my memory by reading the Minutes. When I was going through the Amendments I passed an Amendment standing in the name of Mr. Joynson-Hicks, as I was under the impression that he did not intend to move it. Upon a point of Order, he called my attention to the fact that I had not called his Amendment. I had not put another question, therefore there was no question before the Committee, and there was no question of reversing a decision upon any other question; consequently, acting quite within the Rules of Procedure of the House of Commons, it was in order for the Chairman to call upon Mr. Joynson-Hicks to move his Amendment. I am bound to say that, while I regret it very much, I can only affirm the decision given by the Chairman yesterday, namely, that the only question before the Committee and which can be before the Committee now is "That the Clause, as amended, be added to the Bill."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTONE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not understand that the majority of the Committee were in favour of the Amendment moved from the benches opposite. I understood quite clearly when the question was put by the Chairman that the words in the Bill were to stand part. I did not understand at the time the question was put that hon. Gentlemen opposite had overlooked the fact that the question was being put, and that an Amendment was being ruled out. The agreement among the Committee yesterday was that we did not desire that, through a misunderstanding, hon. Gentlemen opposite should not have had an opportunity of knowing that the question was being put and that an Amendment was being ruled out. What I gathered from other Members of the Committee was that they were quite agreeable that the question should be put and that hon. Members should have a chance of discussing it, because we recognised that, inadvertently, hon. Members opposite did
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1055</span>
not understand the position when the question was put from the Chair. The majority of hon. Members desire that they should have a further opportunity, if it could be allowed by the Chair, to have the matter discussed by the Committee. Had it gone to a vote, I should have voted against the Amendment, and I think there are other Members of the Committee in the same position. It does not necessarily follow that because we sympathise with hon. Members opposite in their wish to have the matter re-discussed that the majority of the Committee would have been in favour of the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members rose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the arguments in the world which you may address to me cannot alter my mind. I am perfectly frank with the Committee. I cannot alter my ruling. I can only repeat, and repeat it. Is there any point in pressing this question further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that every member of the Committee would desire to acknowledge the generous manner in which you, Sir, have endeavoured since the first meeting of the Committee to overcome all difficulties. Please do not think that I in any way desire to criticise your action. I only put to you this point: This is an important Amendment. Whether it would have been carried or lost I cannot say. As it happened, at the time I was speaking to another hon. Member, and as soon as I came back I asked whether the Amendment was carried, and the hon. Member for St. Helens (Mr. Sexton) said "Yes," and I said "That is all right." It is of the utmost importance that we should, if we can, discuss it. Would you allow me to move an Amendment in order that it might be discussed? My proposal would be to add the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"Notwithstanding anything in this Section any officer or servant shall have the right of recourse to arbitration."</p></blockquote>
I simply propose that in order to overcome the difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry, but I cannot accept that. The hon. Member will quite see my difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have taken a decision which precludes that being added. The Question before the Com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1056</span>
mittee is "That the Clause as amended be added to the Bill," and that precludes further Amendments being made, because you have now come to the main issue. That question presupposes that the Committee has amended the Clause to the degree of its desire or its power to amend it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WATERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the difficulty in which you, Sir, are placed. I can only say that a huge mistake has been made. I hope the hon. Member opposite (Mr. Johnstone) is not under the impression that I said—if I did say it, I said it in mistake—that the majority of the Members of the Committee were in favour of the Amendment. What I meant to say was that the majority of the Members misunderstood the situation, which is a vastly different thing. Did I understand you, Sir, to say that there would be no further opportunity of raising this matter on the Report stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought I would give that word of warning. I am not quite hard on it. If hon. Members will allow me to advise them, I would suggest that they had better see Mr. Speaker on the point. You could not raise a question of a charge upon the Treasury on the Report stage, but whether the question of arbitration could be so interpreted as to be wholly a question of money, I am in some little doubt. On that you had better have a word with Mr. Speaker. In the circumstances Mr. Speaker, like the Chairman of the Committee, would be very glad to help any member or any body of members, out of a difficulty which is a perfectly legitimate one. I do not think we can carry it any further this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WIGNALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were undoubtedly misled by the sympathetic consideration of our Amendment in the morning and when the Chairman called a vote we thought he was asking for a vote on the question that the amending words become part of the Bill. When the response was "Yes," we did not say "No," because we thought that all those who said "Yes" were for us. We feel that the duty of the Chairman is properly to interpret the feelings and wishes of the Committee, and that can only be done—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are on a most delicate subject now, and I shall be bound to rule all that out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1057</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WIGNALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not questioning the ruling of the Chairman, but only asking that in view of the misunderstanding and misconception the vote shall not be recorded. The Chairman can only interpret the wishes of the Committee by taking a vote. Probably the vote would have gone against us. I am not in any way challenging the Chairman's decision; I know him too well, and I know that when he has said a thing he will stick to it to the finish. It is an unhappy misunderstanding for which we certainly are to blame.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am one of those who certainly thought that the Amendment of the hon. Member for St. Helens was carried yesterday, the reason for my thinking so being that we discussed Amendments which I thought were consequentive to his Amendment. I would suggest to the Labour members that they might raise the matter by putting down a new Clause, as I understand that there will be difficulty in regard to raising the matter on the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the better plan is for hon. Members to see Mr. Speaker. I am in a little doubt whether it could not be allowed upon Report. I rather fancy Mr. Speaker could allow it. But even taking the most extreme view, it is possible under the Rules of Procedure in the House of Commons to recommit the Bill on the Report stage, so that this could be put right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander DAWES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simplest way to deal with the matter seems to be to negative the Clause altogether, which I imagine will force the Government to put down a new Clause. I was under precisely the same impression yesterday as hon. Members opposite and behind me, that the Amendment had been carried. We had been told earlier in the proceedings that we should have a general discussion on these Amendments so that later on the Amendment of the hon. Member (Mr. Sexton) could be thoroughly discussed and, as I thought, voted on. I did not hear properly what the Chairman was putting. There has clearly been a misunderstanding. On a former occasion you allowed the Committee to reconsider their decision. If you rule now that you cannot do that, that is an end of it. But I suggest to hon. Members who think as I do, that the compensation Clause as it stands now is not a proper one, and that the one suggested by the hon. Member
	<span class='label label-info column'>1058</span>
(Mr. Sexton) is much simpler and more in order, and also in order to correct the misapprehension of those hon. Members, that we should vote against the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The MINISTER-DESIGNATE of WAYS and COMMUNICATIONS (Sir Eric Geddes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret very much that there has been this misapprehension, but the Suggestion just thrown out, that this Clause should be negatived and that the Government should put down a new Clause would lead to further difficulties, because I imagine you, Sir, would rule it out of order for the Government to put down a new Clause dealing with a matter which had already been negatived. If the Clause is negatived, and no additional Clause can be put down, the Bill will go to Report stage, as I am advised, without any protection for the officers and servants at all. It appears to be beyond doubt that Mr. Speaker would rule out of order any new Clause on the Report stage which dealt with a charge on the Treasury. It may be that Mr. Speaker will be able to admit the Amendment of my hon. Friend behind me, but I imagine he would certainly rule out of order a completely new Clause. If the Bill passes through Committee with no Clause protecting officers and servants at all, the situation would be very much worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have to rule that no new Clause could come up which would re-establish something which had been negatived by the Committee. That is my difficulty. I think the Committee will realise that there is but one course, and we must follow that. A mistake has been made, and it cannot be corrected unless it can be corrected in the House of Commons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Clause 6 an Amendment was carried which the Government did not sympathise with, and when the point was put that the Clause stand part of the Bill the Government voted against it and said they would bring up a new Clause. In view of that precedent and the difficulty of my Labour friends opposite, will not the right hon. Gentleman meet them by negativing the Clause and bringing it up again in a fresh form?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not so sure that I shall be able to allow the Minister to move his Clause upon accounts, statistics and returns. I am turning over in my mind what should be my attitude on the very point the hon. Member has raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1059</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. N. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it possible to get out of the difficulty by postponing the Question "That the Clause, as amended, be added to the Bill" in order that Mr. Speaker may be consulted? If so, we could go on with our business and yet keep the matter open. It is impossible to raise such a point of practice with regard to Standing Committees in relation to a difficult subject involving the question of a charge upon the Treasury, and before we take an irrevocable step by negativing the Clause I think it would be better to postpone it until such time as Mr. Speaker's advice can be obtained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are always told that difficulties are made to be overcome, and if there is no machinery to enable this misunderstanding to be set right it is time steps were taken to rectify the Regulations of the House of Commons. I cannot believe there is not some way out of the difficulty. Perhaps, therefore, you will consider it advisable to adjourn this matter in order that you may take counsel with your advisers. Perhaps you may consider it advisable yourself to see Mr. Speaker. I beg to move "That the further consideration of the Clause be postponed."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only time at which an effective appeal can be made for postponing a new Clause is at the beginning. The matter is now before the Committee, and it is not within my power not to put the Question. I am bound to go forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir FORTESCUE FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it were withdrawn—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It cannot be withdrawn. It must be negatived now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great sympathy with the misunderstanding which has arisen. I was the victim of a misunderstanding myself the other day. I voted the wrong way for an Amendment which I had myself proposed, and the majority of those who supported the Amendment also voted the wrong way. You allowed us to go back upon that decision, although we were in the middle of another Amendment. I cannot see why the passing of a night between the incident of yesterday and to-day makes any difference in allowing the Committee to correct what everyone agrees was a misunderstanding. I do not ask you to reverse your ruling, but I
	<span class='label label-info column'>1060</span>
appeal to the Minister-designate in consultation with you to try to find some means by which we could reconsider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I could I would, but I do not feel that I can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could we not report Progress until such time as you can go to Mr. Speaker?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not at all satisfied that the intentions and desires of the Committee are being carried out. I am referring particularly to paragraph (i), (ii) and (vii). Paragraph (i) states
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the Minister requires the services of any existing officer or servant, that officer or servant may be transferred to the Minister either permanently with the consent of the officer or servant or temporarily with the consent, which shall not unreasonably be withheld, of the officer and of the owners of the undertaking, (ii) No existing officer or servant so transferred—"</p></blockquote>
I want to emphasise the words "so transferred." These officers and servants so transferred have an opportunity of submitting their case to arbitration, but no machinery has been set up for any of these officers or servants who have not agreed to follow the suggestion of the Minister. They have to be so transferred and, therefore, the Government has the first and the last word as to how they shall be dealt with. That is not fair. If the machinery should be set up, and it is the intention of the Minister-designate I believe that all these people should have the same opportunity, it is only a question as to who is right, and who is wrong. I am not satisfied that this Clause protects these people. It is all very well for people to say "we are of opinion that they are thoroughy protected," but we have to go further than that. We have to see that they are thoroughly protected, and I cannot see in any part of the Clause where they have the protection of the arbitration Clause. If the Bill passes through Committee in this way, I and some of those who are of the same opinion wish to protect our right to raise the matter on the Report. We went into it yesterday, and many hon. Members are not satisfied that these people have the protection that the Minister himself is desirous of giving. If we allow the Clause to pass unchallenged and without any notification when it is being added to the Bill, we shall have lost an opportunity of raising our objection to this, and when it comes to Report it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0536">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1061</span>
might be brought up against us that on the question of its being added we did not raise any objection. I hope some alterations may be made in the wording as regards this. If my right hon. Friend would consult the draftsman and add some words to protect these people I should be perfectly satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause, as amended, added to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know where we are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have accepted the Clause. That is where you are. I understand that the Minister desires to make a statement upon the new Clause (	<i>Powers as to Railway Wagons</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause as to railway wagons is one of great importance, and although it was set down last Friday, time did not permit of those who are much interested in it giving it the full consideration that they wished at an earlier date, and Amendments were put down yesterday. I think it would assist the Committee in its labours if I did not move this Clause to-day, and before the beginning of next week if I took the opportunity of consulting the interests concerned, I think we could make more progress. Therefore I propose to postpone taking this Clause until a later date. As regards the next new Clause standing in my name (	<i>Claims Against and by the Minister in Respect of the Exercise of Powers</i>), the hon. Member for Dumbarton expressed a wish, in which I fully concur, that we should take that Clause when we have the benefit of the presence and advice of the Home Secretary, who, I hope, will be here tomorrow. Therefore, I propose to postpone that Clause until we have the benefit of my right hon. Friend's presence. If it is in order, I propose to move the next Clause standing in my name (	<i>Accounts, Statistics and Returns</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think on the whole the point of order raised is a proper point of order, but I must ask the Minister to deal with that point on Report. I think it is out of order to deal with it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister-designate name a day when the question of wagons will be considered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be next week, no doubt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1062</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A great many gentlemen have come up from the country on this one Clause, and if he could name a day now it would facilitate matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think he can say whether it will be Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. I hope it will be Tuesday. I do want the Committee to finish this Bill next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be the best way to finish it, if we can have a time fixed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new Clause, standing in the name of Mr. Kiley, is not in order. The question of giving notice before taking possession was discussed on Clause 3, and therefore is disposed of. The same decision applies to the next Clause, standing in the name of Sir William Raeburn, dealing with docks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very puzzling to a new member, and I hope we shall not get tied in a knot as we did yesterday. I understood that the Minister-designate was going to move his new Clause (	<i>Accounts, Statistics and Returns</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> That is not in order. The new Clause standing in the name of Mr. Chadwick (	<i>As to Orders under this Act</i>) is also out of order, for the reasons I have stated. With respect to the Clause standing in the name of Mr. Rowlands (	<i>As to Orders made by the Minister</i>) I would ask him to leave out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or under Subsection (1) of the Section of this Act whereof the marginal note is, 'Power to establish transport services.'"</p></blockquote>
The Clause itself deals with what is to be done by Order in Council. If these words were left out the Clause would be in order, but if they were left in it would not be in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shall I have an opportunity of moving the Clause standing in my name (	<i>As to Orders under this Act</i>)? I do not want to lose my chance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will not have any chance here. It is out of order. I do not know what will happen downstairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the complications of Parliamentary procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H.

	<div class='title'>—(As to Orders made by the Minister.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>(1) Before making any order under paragraph (	<i>d</i>) of Sub-section (1) of Section 3 of this Act, the Minister shall cause notice of his intention to make the order and of the place where copies of the draft order may be inspected and obtained, and of the time within and manner in which objections to the draft order may be made to be published in the "London Gazette," and in such other manner as they think best adapted for informing persons affected, and to be sent to the council of every county borough or district in which the proposed services would be situate, and before making an order the Minister shall consider any objections made to the draft order, and may in any case cause a public local inquiry to be held with respect to any objections to the draft order.</p>
	<p>(2) After an order has been settled by the Minister, it shall be published in such manner as he thinks best adapted for informing persons affected with notice that he has settled the order, and that the order will become final and have effect as an Act of Parliament unless within such period, not being less than thirty days, as may be stated in the notice, a memorial is presented to the Minister by some person or body affected by the order.</p>
	<p>(3) If no memorial has been presented against the order within such period as aforesaid, or if every such memorial has been withdrawn, the Minister shall make the order, and the order shall thereupon have effect as if enacted in this Act, but if any such memorial has been presented, and has not been withdrawn, the order shall be provisional only, and shall have no effect unless and until confirmed by Parliament.</p>
	<p>(4) The Minister may submit to Parliament for confirmation any Provisional Order made by him in pursuance of this Act.</p>
	<p>If, while the Bill confirming any such order is pending in either House of Parliament, a petition is presented against any order comprised therein the Bill, so far as it relates to such Order, may be referred to a Select Committee and the Petitioner shall be allowed to appear and oppose as in the case of Private Bills.—[	<i>Mr. Rowlands</i>.]</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ROWLANDS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Clause be read a second time."</p></blockquote>
I am not making this point simply on my own responsibility. There is very strong feeling throughout the country amongst representatives of local authorities, both urban councils and municipalities, that the procedure suggested by the Minister-designate by Order in Council would prevent them under certain circumstances taking action to safeguard themselves when necessary against interference with their right to say that work should be carried out in consonance with the amenities of their locality. I know it may be urged by the Minister that the reason Orders in Council are put forward is because that procedure is more speedy than the system foreshadowed in the new Clause which I am moving. I am not particularly enamoured of Orders in Council where any public right is interfered with. I know Orders in Council are to lie upon the Table for thirty days or whatever period is put in the Act, but those of us who have had many years' experience of this House are quite aware that unless it is something more drastic in character, it is impossible to keep a House to discuss an Order in Council after the ordinary business of the day is done. Therefore, local authorities want the Minister to accept something which, while not interfering with his powers, will enable them to protect themselves in their own localities. The procedure in the Clause I am moving is different from that of an Order in Council. It is a procedure which has been very lately passed by Parliament and applied to local authorities. In 1918 an Act was passed called "The Land Drainage Act, 1918," and in the Schedule of that Act will be found embodied the principle which has been taken from that Act and embodied in the Clause I am moving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know it may be said, and I am quite prepared to concede this fact, especially if I get more information upon it, that the position of local authorities is somewhat different now than it was when the Bill was introduced on Second Reading. The right hon. Gentleman may say that he has conceded the local authorities representation on one of the Advisory Committees. I want to see how far their status goes, and whether they really have any responsible position which would enable them, when it is necessary, to prevent an entirely drastic alteration of their locality without having an opportunity of putting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1065</span>
their views before some authority. Under these conditions, I beg to move this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY (Designate) to the MINISTRY of WAYS and COMMUNICATIONS (Major Baird)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has referred to Orders in Council. There is no question of Orders in Council in the Clause to which the new Clause refers. It is merely a question of simple administrative orders, and as the Chairman has ruled, Orders in Council are dealt with in the appropriate Clause to which they refer. I take it, therefore, that my hon. Friend does not wish to press the point about Orders in Council. As regards the simple orders, and the safeguard which my hon. Friend desires to introduce, I would call his attention to the very wide scope of the Clause which he has proposed, if it were carried. It says
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before making any Order under paragraph (	<i>d</i>) of Sub-section (1) of Section three of this Act."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph (	<i>d</i>) of Section 3 reads as follows:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"For enabling any directions given by the Minister as to alterations and improvements and additions to be carried into effect, the Minister may by order authorise the owners of any undertaking to acquire any land, etc."</p></blockquote>
In practice, if my hon. Friend's proposal were carried, it would mean that any single landowner could hold up any scheme, however important, until the provisions in the later paragraphs of my hon. Friend's Clause were complied with. There would be all the paraphernalia of private Bill procedure. The Bill is perfectly useless unless it is applied and worked with good will and give and take by all people. It is an emergency measure, to deal with an emergency situation of vital importance to the country as a whole, and to protect local interests and meet precisely the case which my hon. Friend has brought forward. Advisory Committees have been set up since my hon. Friend's Amendment was put on the Paper. We have had a long discussion on those Advisory Committees. The form in which they have been set up will afford all adequate and legitimate protection to any interest that may feel anxious about their future. It covers the whole ground and includes all conceivable sections of society who want to be heard and make their views known before action is taken. It is obligatory on the Minister to submit the matter to the Committee on which there
	<span class='label label-info column'>1066</span>
will be representatives of all these local interests. Then it is provided that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The advisory panel or any committee to whom any matter is referred under this Section shall,, before reporting or advising, if they see fit, give-public notice and permit any person affected or likely to be affected to place their views before them either orally or in writing."</p></blockquote>
I suggest that a very real and sincere-attempt has been made by the Government to meet the legitimate anxiety of people whose property and interests may be injuriously affected by the operation of this Bill. This procedure by simple administrative order is not new. We need not plead justification on the ground of the exceptional nature of the situation which has to be dealt with, and the avowedly exceptional nature of the position in which we are at present, because we can refer to a number of cases in which Parliament has sanctioned Government action being taken under simple administrative order. Under the Small Holdings Act of 1908 the Board of Agriculture may acquire land by simple administrative order. The same procedure is applied in connection with Part 3 of the Housing Act for the provision of new houses, and the Development Commissioners can authorise the acquisition of land on similar terms. For instance, in the Development and Road Improvements Act of 1909 it is laid down that where an advance is made under this part of this Act for any purpose which involves the acquisition of land the department, body or person to whom the advance is made may acquire and hold land for the purpose, and where they are unable to acquire by agreement on reasonable terms any land which they consider necessary they may apply to the Development Commissioners for an Order empowering them to acquire that land compulsorily, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, and the Commissioners shall have power to make such order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a temporary measure to deal with what we hope is a passing situation but is a permanent piece of legislative machinery. The House of Commons accorded these very wide powers to a Government Department, without any of the safeguards which are provided in the Advisory Committees. This Bill is a measure which is to exist for two years. In two years' time it has got to come up for revision, and Clause 3 in particular, to which this Clause refers, is a temporary Clause, the powers there being with temporary matters. I do hope that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1067</span>
the Committee will not accept this Amendment, because it would have the effect of hampering the activity of the Minister, and preventing much-needed improvements and alterations being carried into effect. With the safeguards contained in the Advisory Committees, as to their composition and power, as to the obligation placed on the Minister of consulting them, as to the publicity which will be given inevitably by the inquiries which those Committees are authorised to hold, I hope that this Committee will consider that the case is met, and will not press this Amendment which will have a hampering effect and prevent the Minister carrying out those improvements which we are all agreed will have to be undertaken, and make almost impossible the very onerous and difficult task which he has to accomplish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following this Amendment there are Amendments in my name and in the names of the hon. Members for Middleton (Sir R. Adkins), and for Batley (Mr. France), which refer to the question of Orders. Do you propose to take these Amendments separately, or to allow us to discuss them on the present Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I would take the Second Reading of this Clause. There are three Clauses to be moved, one by Mr. Joynson-Hicks, one by yourself, and one by Sir Ryland Adkins and Mr. France. They would be in order, but the Clause standing in the name of Sir Ryland Adkins and Mr. France seems to me to raise the matter in the best form, and I would suggest to my hon. Friends that they would take that Clause as being the Clause covering the points both of Mr. Joynson-Hicks and yourself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend (Major Baird) has made use of very fallacious arguments, which may mislead the Committee as to the applicability of the safeguards which he says already exist. There is a very substantial misunderstanding as to the effects of the proposal and the effect of the safeguards which he puts forward as having been furnished by the Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committees determined merely a question of policy as to the taking over of these undertakings. They have got nothing whatever to do with the machinery, and how those matters should be dealt with. I can well imagine a few years hence,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1068</span>
when this Bill has been in operation, and the authorities of this Department are asked to submit to the Advisory Committees matters relating to the method and the machinery under which they should exercise their powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A few years hence this power will not remain. The particular Clause which we are discussing is a two years Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even within the two years something may be done which will cause irreparable damage. My hon. Friend in justifying his opposition to this Amendment has referred to the powers of the Development Commissioners under the Act of 1909. That is a very different matter, where you have got a person who is likely to hold up an improvement as the owner of property upon a road. I speak very feelingly, because a year or two before the war my county succeeded after very great trouble in getting statutory authorisation to construct what was known as the West Road, which was to get rid once for all of that terrible difficulty of persons going west by road which was presented by the Brentford High Street. We got special powers, aided by the Road Board and the Development Commissioners, to construct a tremendous big road which would act as a kind of loop. There, of course, we got the powers which were necessary in case a man tried to obstruct a definite settled policy. Put this is not the case of an obstructing person who is going to prevent a big Hung being carried through, It is a most unreasonable attitude for the Government to oppose this on the ground that while they have Advisory Committees whose duties must, upon the proper interpretation of the Bill, be wholly restricted to questions of policy, and which can have no reference to the methods by which that is to be taken. I would strongly urge the Minister to reconsider this non-possumus attitude and let fair consideration be given to the matter. There is need for some provision for publicity to enable the operations of Clause 3 to be put fairly and squarely before those concerned before it comes into operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Clause be read a second time."</p></blockquote>
I must throw myself upon the indulgence of the Committee, because I had no idea, and I do not think anyone could have had any idea that this new Clause would have been reached to-day. The hon. Member (Sir Ryland Adkins), who accepted the responsibility for moving this Amendment on behalf of the County Councils Association is not here, and will himself have no idea whatever that this Clause is reached to-day. Therefore, in putting this Clause before the Committee, I can only deal generally and briefly with the reasons which induced us to put it down. It will be remembered that at the outset of the discussion on the Bill there was a general agreement in the House that the powers with regard to the Orders in Council originally in the Bill were objectionable, and the Minister-designate agreed to take out that portion of the Bill. Under Clause 2 and in some respects under other Clauses, the Minister is to proceed by means of Orders in Council. I want to make it perfectly clear to the Minister and the Committee that in proposing this New Clause I have no intention or wish to put any clumsy and obstructive machinery in the way of proceeding towards those benefits which this Bill, properly administered, will give to the country. When the Health Bill and the Housing Bill were before a Commit-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1070</span>
	<p>tee, certain new Clauses were introduced making it obligatory that powers obtained through Orders in Council—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon. Friend whether the Clause he is proposing is intended to apply to more than the powers under Clause 2? I quite realise the difficulty he is in and I sympathise very much with him, but his new Clause only deals with the powers under Clause 2. I may be quite wrong, but I do not see how that would more particularly affect local authorities or any of the other bodies under the Bill because it is merely a transfer of powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman must recognise that the Chairman has selected, no doubt for good reasons of his own, this as the representative new Clause. I should have thought that it would be possible for other hon. Members who have other new Clauses down to widen the scope of the discussion by referring to their particular new Clauses which go beyond Clause 2. It is true that this new Clause, as drafted, only deals with the powers under Clause 2, but I thought I was following the direction of the Chairman in leading the discussion on to wider lines by referring to Orders in Council in general. It is very strongly felt by those who do not wish in any sense to obstruct the powers which will be transferred; more than is reasonably necessary, that we should bring the Minister directly under the control of, and that he should be responsible to the House of Commons. He himself has always taken up the position that while he would not wish to have—I quite sympathise with him—any undue interference, or that executive power should be taken from him by Advisory Councils or Committees, he did recognise that he was responsible to the House of Commons in regard to taking over new undertakings or any powers which are still left to him in Clause 4 by means of Orders in Council. It has been felt in several Committees,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0541">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1071</span>
and it would be endorsed by the House of Commons as a whole that there should be some period of time during which the House might carefully consider the undertakings, the Minister proposes to take over, and that they should not be proceeded with unless the House of Parliament have given their assent thereto. That is, in effect, the general underlying motive of this new Clause which is to be taken as representative of the new Clauses that are on the Paper. I agree that it does strike to some extent at the whole root of the Bill, but not in any obstructive sense. It is only to provide that, while a matter is being considered, public attention should be called to it, that both Houses of Parliament should have an opportunity of considering these Orders in Council, and that they should not be rushed through or, as in the old days, simply lie on the Table of the House as a mere matter of form. It should be possible for both Houses to express their opinion upon the Orders in Council which the Minister desires to put in operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Second Reading of this new Clause. I have a new Clause in front of this one on the Order Paper which raises the question in a wider form, but as the Chairman has decided that we should take the discussion on the Clause now before the Committee all we can do is to support it. With all respect to the hon. Member for Batley (Mr. France) he has made his new Clause much too narrow, because it applies merely to Clause 2. The new Clause relating to railway wagons which has been postponed this morning also has a Sub-section dealing with Orders in Council. Clause 2 contains pretty wide powers. It says:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"There shall, as from such date or dates as His Majesty in Council may by Order determine, be transferred to the Minister all powers and duties of any Government Department in relation to (	<i>a</i>) railways; (	<i>b</i>) light railways; (	<i>c</i>) tramways; (	<i>d</i>) canals, waterways, and inland navigations; (	<i>c</i>) roads, bridges and ferries, and vehicles and traffic thereon; (	<i>f</i>) harbours, docks and piers."</p></blockquote>
I am particularly interested in docks and harbours. It is very desirable that before these Orders in Council become operative the Department should publish them in the way proposed in this new Clause. This is quite a new form of Act of Parliament and deals with quite new powers. Such powers have never been given to any Government Department before. We are,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1072</span>
therefore, very anxious that we should know what the Minister means to do when he proposes to transfer these powers, it; is with that object and not with the object of being obstructive that we are proposing this publication. We want publicity; to ensure that the local authorities specified in Clause 2 shall have proper notice. I hope the Minister-designate will see his way to accept the Clause, if not in the exact form in which it is moved, perhaps in some other form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree that the new Clause only deals with the transfer of powers under Clause 2. That does not satisfy either myself or my friends. We want it to be much wider in its application than that. I have an Amendment down on page 969 of the Order Paper which covers Clause 2 and Clause 3. It is rather different from the Amendment moved from the other side which was defeated a few minutes ago. I should have thought that for the convenience of discussion this new Clause and my own might be taken together. This new Clause only deals with Clause 2. That is not sufficient for our purposes. We want it to apply to Clause 3 as well. May I ask you, Sir, whether this would not be a convenient time to discuss my new Clause, which appears on page 969 of the Order Paper in conjunction with the new Clause now under discussion, or whether, if this Clause is defeated, mine will be out of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give a ruling beforehand. The hon. Member must wait</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I do not know why I received the benefit of your ruling in favour of my new Clause. It is an enviable position for which I am much obliged. May I ask your ruling, Sir, on this point? One would have thought that the widest new Clause would have been the one taken. Mine is not the widest by any means; it only applies to Clause 2. There is a new Clause which precedes it on the Paper in the name of my hon. Friend behind me (Mr. Gilbert), and I should like to know, exactly where we stand if it is desired by the Committee to make this Clause wider?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A manuscript Amendment has been handed in to this Clause, to leave out the words "Section two of" which will generalise the question. The hon. Member should move his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0542">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1073</span>
Clause, and if the Committee adopts it, then I will take the Amendment to leave out those words, which will make it general. That is why I have taken his new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not that my new Clause which you asked me not to move? That applies to all the Clauses in the Bill. If the hon. Member for Batley (Mr. France) gets the Clause agreed to and amended it simply becomes the same as mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so. The Chairman can only do the best he can. I rather think I am right in this matter. If you want to generalise the new Clause I will put the new Amendment to which I have referred, which will be moved by Mr. Stevens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will cover my new Clause, because it will be taking out the particularisation of Clause 2. That seems to be quite satisfactory so far as I am concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major BAIRD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very complicated and difficult question to deal with for a variety of reasons. In the first place, I admit that the Government have given an undertaking on this subject. I will deal with that later. The Clause as proposed refers to "Section 2 of the Act." Under Sub-section (1) of Clause 2 the Orders in Council do not settle which are to be the powers to be transferred. The House has already settled them downstairs. All that the Order in Council settles is the date on which those powers are to be transferred. We have already settled that there shall be transferred to the Minister powers and duties of any Government Department in relation to railways, light railways, tramways, canals, roads, harbours, docks and piers. That has already been settled, therefore what has to be decided by Order in Council is merely the date. Clause 2 says there shall be transferred
	<br><blockquote><p>"as from such date or dates as His Majesty in Council may by Order determine."</p></blockquote>
The next point is in Sub-section (1) of the same Clause—
	<br><blockquote><p>"His Majesty in Council may by Order except from such transfer—"</p></blockquote>
The third point arises in Sub-section (2):
	<br><blockquote><p>"His Majesty in Council may by Order make such incidental, consequential and supplemental provisions—"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there not something in Sub-section (1), line 26, which the hon. and gallant Gentleman has omitted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1074</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major BAIRD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a transfer to the Admiralty instead of to the Minister. These are all matters of machinery, and these are the points covered by the Clause moved by my hon. Friend. The Home Secretary gave an undertaking on 8th April that notice would be given of the transfer of these powers. He said,
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the hon. Member will withdraw we can introduce an Amendment of a similar nature 	<i>on</i> the Report stage which will ensure that the transfer under Clause 2, Sub-section (1), can be inserted, say, after the word 'aforesaid,' and we would accept that on the Report."</p></blockquote>
The Government hoped then that the Bill would be in a very much more advanced state by this date than it is. We confidently looked forward to the possibility of laying these Orders on the Table for the thirty days suggested. But the position to-day is that the Bill cannot possibly pass through both Houses until very near the end of the Session. If the Committee insists that nothing shall be done under Clause 2 until a draft Order in Council has been laid on the Table of both Houses for thirty days it is absolutely impossible for them to be laid until after the summer Recess. We do not know yet when the House will meet in the autumn, or whether it will meet, but the necessity of putting an Order in Council on the Table of the two Houses before my right hon. Friend can take any action whatever means that he is immobilised. He is thrown out of action completely until thirty days at least after the House meets in the autumn. That is one side of the story. The other side of the story is that we have given the undertaking that I have read out, that warning shall be given to the persons interested, and that the Home Secretary quite agreed to the reasonableness of that. I am still on the Amendment in the form in which it is moved, because the rest of the Orders in Council cover a much wider ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have, indeed, got into a difficult position, and if we are to look upon the question from the practical point of view of getting to work and carrying out the functions which Parliament has decided shall be discharged, we must find some solution of this difficulty. I an authorised by my right hon. Friend to make this proposal. We clearly cannot

	<span class='label label-info column'>1075</span>
lay a draft Order in Council until the Bill has become law. We cannot equally publish in the "London Gazette" until the Bill has become law. The Bill cannot become law until very near the end of the Session, and, therefore, the intervention of the thirty days has now become an impossibility. This proposal is therefore submitted on behalf of the Government, that we should forthwith, while the Bill is under discussion, issue a White Paper shewing the fresh powers which it is proposed should be taken over from the Board of Trade and the Local Government Board, which are the two offices mainly concerned, that the widest publicity should be given to that White Paper, and that the intention of taking over these powers shall be made widely known so far as it is possible throughout the Press of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The dates?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major BAIRD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The dates, of course, must depend on the time when the Bill passes, but as soon as the Bill passes my right hon. Friend will proceed to take over these powers in order that ho may get to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the White Paper be issued before the Report stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major BAIRD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be issued at the earliest possible moment. I do not think it is yet decided when the Report stage will be taken. We realise very clearly both the force of the obligation into which the Government has entered and the force of the practical objections which would stultify altogether the objects of the Bill unless the Government were released from the obligation which it undertook. The suggestion I have outlined would ensure that full publicity shall be given, and after all that is what the Mover of the Amendment is seeking to obtain. He is seeking to avoid the situation when the owners of an undertaking may wake up one morning and find they have been taken possession of by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are you dealing only with Clause 2 or with Clause 3 as well, when you ask for the powers by the White Paper?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major BAIRD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the Clause as it stands on the Paper, which is the Clause covered by the undertaking of the Home Secretary. My right hon. Friend was dealing on 8th April with an Amendment dealing specifically with Clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1076</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was your putting in the words "taking possession of" that aroused my fear that you were dealing with Clause 3, because the other is a transfer of powers from one Department. to another. It is not taking possession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major BAIRD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is perfectly correct, and that is the only thing that is covered by the Clause that is proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. and gallant Friend realise that it has just been put from the Chair that if the Clause is read a second time an Amendment will cut out the limitations relating to Clause 2?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is if the Committee accepts it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we not arguing on the hypothesis that the wider aspect will be given rather than the narrower?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major BAIRD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had better stick to what is before the Committee. The Chairman warned us what his intentions were. What we have to deal with now is the actual Clause before the Committee, and that is a very difficult matter for the Government to deal with, for the reasons I have given. I trust my hon. Friend will not press the Amendment and that the Committee will accept the proposal I have made, that in order to carry out our obligations under Clause 2 we will draw up at the earliest possible date and issue a. White Paper containing a list of the powers it is proposed to transfer and give the widest publicity to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot help thinking the Committee has, perhaps unintentionally, been rather unfairly dealt with in this matter. This Amendment has been on the Paper for some considerable time. Surely, if the Government had realised the necessity of issuing a White Paper they should have done it previously, and not waited until this Clause came up for discussion. Many of us felt that the question of Orders in Council was one of the most important factors in regard to the Bill. The Amendment was placed on the Paper by a large number of Members protesting against Orders in Council; but we are more or less to be brought into this position. We are going to have important proposals made, and we are probably going to have important contracts entered into and gigantic undertakings purchased, and not one

	<p>	<div class='member'>Major BAIRD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That ïs the exact opposite of what I said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is not the object of the Government, they should have put us in possession of the White Paper that they propose issuing. When these things are hushed up and are not brought forward till the last moment, many of us view them with a certain amount of suspicion and ask what is behind the whole of it. The right hon. Gentleman (Sir E. Geddes) in the business with which he was connected, would not have allowed questions regarding important contracts to be brought forward until he had had a fair opportunity of discussing them. This is a most important business undertaking which is to be placed under a man of business. We do not know how long he will be there or who will follow him, and we are going to take all the steps we can to see that the public are protected against all sorts of measures being put into operation without the House of Commons having an opportunity of discussing them. I ask the right hon. Gentleman if he will withdraw this Clause and issue his White Paper to-night. He knows what he desires to say in that paper. If he does not, he ought to know. If he issues the White Paper to-night he could let us have an opportunity of discussing it, say, tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clock, or next Tuesday. The importance of this matter warrants us in making this protest, and I sincerely trust that he will fall in with the suggestion I have put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Either I do not understand the position, or some of the speakers do not understand the position, and I would like to put it as I see it. We are talking about Orders in Council. Orders in Council which can be issued under the Bill as it stands to-day deal with the following matters: Transfer of powers, re-transfer of powers, exceptions to the transfer of powers, and consequential adaptations of acts. As regards the question of transfer and re-transfer, it is a question of date. The powers which may be transferred under the Bill, and which come under the Bill are all settled by the Bill, and the Order in Council is only as to the date in respect to these matters. As my hon. Friend has put it very clearly we did undertake,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1078</span>
perhaps optimistically, when we thought the Bill was going to have a more speedy passage than it has had—I make no complaint about that—that we would lay the Orders in Council fixing the date of transfer, for thirty days, or that we would, take steps to introduce such provision. I would remind the Committee that these thirty days are thirty days on which either House sits, and I am told that that is approximately two months in the House of Lords, so that it would mean that if the Bill does not pass until nearly the end of the Session, and we have to wait until after the recess, until the House again reassembles, the effect of this Bill will be very much retarded. The Home Secretary did say that we would lay these Orders in Council on the Table for thirty days, so that everyone would know what powers would be transferred, but in view of the length of time that the Bill has taken in passing through Committee that would have the effect of retarding action under the Act. My hon. Friend, therefore, proposes on my behalf that we should issue, before this Bill becomes an Act, a White Paper, and that we should give it the widest publicity, so that it may be perfectly clear to members of this Committee, to Members of the House, and to all concerned, what powers are being transferred. That is our suggestion for getting out of the difficulty. That is so far as powers under Section 2 are concerned. Let us see what other acts can be done by Orders in Council. The establishment of a new service can be carried out by Order in Council, but it is specifically provided that a positive Resolution of both Houses must be given before-the new service can be installed, because it would inevitably mean in any service of size, either breaking up a road or taking land compulsorily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Coastwise service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have no power to run coastwise services. I wish I could get that misapprehension out of the minds of the Committee. There is no power to run any service by sea except such service as the railway companies to-day have power to run.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The railway companies may run or have powers to run.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

hon. and gallant Member will allow me, I will see that an official gives him a list of these powers. They are limited powers. They are specified powers, and we have no other powers at all as regards steamship services. I have dealt with Orders in Council fixing the date as to the transfer of powers, and when we have to deal with an Order in Council which enables us to establish a new service, if it is a service of any magnitude at all, we have got to get a positive Resolution, not a negative resolution, from both Houses. The only other action that we can take by Order in Council under the Bill is—and we have not reached that yet—in regard to railway wagons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E.

If you do not accept that view and the Committee wish this Clause put in, the Government would accept it with one small Amendment, to leave out the words "two years" and to substitute the words "the period of possession."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We think this is necessary. There may be some alteration made during the period of possession, or there may be something acquired or done which the dock authorities would wish to continue, but in regard to which they would have no power to change dues or to apply their regulations without coming here for an Act of Parliament. This Clause provides for a most necessary thing.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E.

I am told that in the Bill as it stands this is provided for, but if it is not provided for, then there is no objection from the Government point of view to put this in, because manifestly it would be ridiculous to arrange with a dock authority—because these are not going to be, I hope, arbitrary Orders—that a certain land is necessary to connect a railway and a dock, and at the end of the period of possession that that land—if their fear is right, and I am told it is not—would have to belong to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1082</span>
someone else, and not to the dock authorities, and that the dock authorities would have no right to use it. Therefore the Committee will agree that if this power is not included in the Bill it ought to be. That is why I am in favour of this Amendment to make it clear.

This Clause, which stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for White-chapel (Mr. Kiley) has been put down in order to protect the Port of London wharfingers. There are 10 miles of wharves in the Port of London which are in competition with the Port of London authorities. It is more convenient to raise this point here, even than on the Clause, which is in the name of my hon. Friend (Sir F. Hall) and myself lower down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. PEARCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A large part of the trade of the Port of London, probably half, is in the hands of wharfingers. They employ more men than the Port of London Authority. I mention this to show how and what are their interests. Under the Port of London Act they were protected in all sorts of ways. There is a scheme by which the Port of London authority cannot break rates without the consent of the wharfingers, and in many other ways they are given a great deal of security. They are recognised really as partners with the Port of London Authority in the management of trade on the River Thames. It is felt by this large interest, and it is evident that this will be so, that if the new Ministry acquire possession of the Port of London Authority undertaking, without accepting their responsibilities, they will be in such a position that they can run the London wharfingers off their rates. They could lower rates and make it quite impossible for the London wharfingers to exist. They could enter into all sorts of competitive methods, and the Government must recognise that in the event of their taking possession of the Port of London Authority they must accept the responsibility. If the Minister is prepared to give that undertaking, he will get rid of a great deal of the discussion which must arise on this important question. It is clearly necessary that some undertaking should be given by the Minister-designate that this enormous interest should receive adequate consideration. Their position is fundamentally altered by the Port of London Authority passing into the hands of a Government Department. It hardly appears to me to require to be argued that if the Government take possession of the undertaking they must accept its responsibilities. If I can get that promise I have no more to say. We have been trying to persuade the Minister to avoid taking
	<span class='label label-info column'>1084</span>
power of possession of the Port of London Authority, but that has been refused, and we are not able to raise it a second time. But this is a complication of great magnitude which has been recognised by the House of Commons, and the London wharfingers are waiting to hear a pronouncement by the Minister that if he does take possession of the Port of London undertaking he will accept the full responsibilities with regard to wharves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I desire to thank the Chairman for telling me what part of my Clause will be out of order. The hon. Member has put the matter very clearly. Wharfingers are one of those old classes of people who have been in business, in many cases, even before the first docks were started in London. They were the pioneers of building up the great Port of London. If one goes back to the debates in the House of Commons in 1908, it will be seen that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is now Prime Minister, drew attention to the fact that these wharfingers should be protected also because of the competition that was necessary in the Port of London, in order that the port itself might be protected. What would be the position if these wharfingers were wiped out? The dock authorities under the Government would be enabled, should they so desire, to offer such rates as to squeeze these people out of business, and I cannot think when one comes to consider the enormous business that is done by these people, and the rateable value of their places alone, over £250,000 per annum, that this should be done. If the Government are going to take steps that will put these people out of business altogether, or in a state of bankruptcy, the sooner we know it the better, because then they will be able to take such steps perhaps as would save for themselves a certain amount of their assets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to know if the Minister-designate is prepared to say that he will take over the wharves and the wharfingers? That is rather an extraordinary question to emanate from me, because I have always been desirous of curtailing the responsibilities placed upon the shoulders of my right hon. Friend. He has stated over and over again that the article will never be complete unless he has this or that thrown in. "I want," he says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the whole thing in my hands, in order that I may be able to distribute the goods according to what I think is the best way."</p></blockquote>
My right hon. Friend, I am sure, is aware of the enormous amount of good work the wharfingers have done in the past. They have been of the utmost value to the Port of London. I have been looking up the Debates in the House of Commons on the 6th of May, 1908, and I noticed the exact words the present Prime Minister used on that day. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The wharfinger has been keeping the dock authority up to the mark, though this means no reflection whatever upon the docks."</p></blockquote>
I quite agree, and if, for instance, the one has been keeping the other up to the mark, then under these circumstances it is proved, conclusively, they must have been of great value to the port as a whole. If that is so, surely it would be advantageous for my right hon. Friend to take over the wharves themselves. If not, what will happen? He will have a tremendous amount of stuff coming into the Port of London, he will not know what to do, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>1086</span>
must necessarily say to himself, "Well, I have not got sufficient wharfage, because the price i have fixed is so low that the wharfingers cannot live or exist." My right hon. Friend will say that as a business man he is not likely to do that. But, personally, I do not know what will happen if the State is to compete against everybody, wash them out, and take every step they can and use every weapon that they have in their hands. It is to guard against anything like that that we are desirous of seeing the wharfingers protected. It is not unreasonable to ask that this be done, and I should have thought it was to the advantage of the Ministry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it was necessary for my right hon. Friend to have control of the roads, the decks, the railway systems, and now we are told the control of electricity, why should he be leaving out eight miles of wharves, with accommodation for storing half the amount of the stuff coming into the Port of London? If you take the figures produced, they show that in the ordinary course of events about 50 per cent. of the stuff is stored in the wharves and warehouses of the Port of London Authority, and the other half in the private wharves of the wharfingers themselves. My right hon. Friend has stated that as far as he is concerned he will not have any powers conferred upon him that were not conferred on the Port of London Authority. I quite agree. I have carefully looked through the Port of London Act, and I cannot see anything that protects the wharfinger in any shape or form. In Clause 13, Sub-section (1, 	<i>a</i>), it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in this Section shall authorise the Port Authority to charge lower port rates in respect of goods to be discharged from a vessel in the dock of the Port Authority."</p></blockquote>
That is all right. I agree that my right hon. Friend cannot charge lower port rates in respect of the goods to be discharged. But it is not the port charges, but the actual warehousing charges. When the Bill went through the Commons in 1908 the importance of these people on whose behalf I happen to be speaking at the present time was admitted, because, not only are they amongst those who have the selection of representatives on the Port Authority, but, in addition to that, it is laid down by the Port Act that one of the wharfingers themselves shall be elected to that body. That speaks volumes for the appreciation of the members of the Government in 1908 of the services rendered by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0549">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1087</span>
the wharfingers. If you are going to do anything to weaken the position of the wharfingers in the Port of London and all over the country, and compel these people to go out of the business, you are going to handicap not only the Port of London, but the ports throughout the kingdom. It is against that that we raise the objection, and it is in the hope that my right hon. Friend will be able to see his way, having taken such a large bite of the cake, to complete the whole thing by taking over the wharfingers on the terms arranged for by the Port of London Authority, that I support the Clause proposed by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support the Clause. Those of us who are concerned in the Port of London have already urged the special conditions under which the Port of London carries on. If the Committee will bear with me, I would like to put before them the position of the port, why there is a Port of London Authority, and the position of the wharfingers as far as the port is concerned. When the Act was passed which set up the Port of London Authority the port of London was managed or controlled by various dock companies or combines of dock companies, and in addition to that there were the private wharfingers who, as my hon. Friend has stated, have a considerable part of the warehouse trade of London. In the Port of London Act special consideration was put in as regards the wharfingers. The wharfingers who owned the wharves alongside the river are the people who had, as the hon. Member for Dulwich has said, about half the warehousing trade connected with the port, and if you take the supply of goods, I am told upon reliable authority that of the tea trade, for instance, 75 per cent. is done by the private wharfingers in London; the plantation rubber trade—quite a recent trade—75 per cent.; and about 50 per cent. of the wool trade. Those Members who know the port of London will know that we of the Port Authority deal with the ships in the docks, and that these ships are barged to the private wharves. A large part of the trade is done by the barges which use the River Thames, and it is because we want to protect these private wharfingers that we are urging that this new Clause should be accepted by the Committee. The wharfingers themselves have always worked hand in hand with the Port Autho-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1088</span>
rity. There is a working agreement as regards rates. The Port Authority cannot cut rates. The wharfingers have, as. already explained, a special representative on the Port of London Authority, and there is a complete Clause in the Port of London Act under which we have to keep special books as far as warehousing work is concerned, in order that they may inspect and see that we are carrying on business fairly and not with the object of killing their particular trade. You may ask why it was the wharfingers were not taken over with the Port Authority. I think it would have been a very much better thing if the business had been taken over and one complete authority set up. But if you look up the Debates at the time the Act went through, the Ministers in charge thought that to buy out the wharfingers would have cost far too much money. I do not think there is any other port with anything like the same agreement or where trade is divided in the same way. Under Clause 3, if the Minister takes over the Port Authority, the officials of the port under paragraph (	<i>c, i</i>) are bound to follow his directions regarding rates, fares, tolls, dues, etc. There is no power in this Act unless he buys the private wharfingers right out. He can only take over a public or semi-public authority, and I think, in the interests of the Port of London trade, that we ought to have a much more definite assurance than that which the hon. Member, speaking for the Government, gave us this morning. That the wharfingers, who have an enormous amount of private capital sunk in these wharves, should be protected under this Bill. It is for these reasons that I support the Clause and I hope the Minister in charge of the Bill will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really think that here there is a genuine misunderstanding. Hon. Members are continually telling us that the protection which the wharfingers have had is endangered. I have spent quite a considerable time since we adjourned this morning in consultation with the Parliamentary draftsman, and I am advised by him that it is perfectly clear that, whatever undertaking the Minister may take over under the powers of this Bill, except and in so far as the statutory provisions of the Acts governing those undertakings are specifically abrogated by the terms of this Act, the Minister is bound by the obligations, imposed by those special Statutes. If that is really in doubt
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0550">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1089</span>
I shall be glad to consult with hon. Members between now and the Report stage, but if it is not in doubt I think the point is sufficiently met. Whatever safeguards the wharfingers have under the Port of London Act remain unless they are specifically withdrawn by the terms of this Act. One of the particular provisions in this measure is that the Minister may, notwithstanding statutory maxima, direct that rates shall be raised. It is essential to the Port of London Authority that that particular power should obtain with the Minister because they have not powers today, other than under the Defence of the Realm Act, to charge the rates they are charging and, therefore, if this were passed in these terms it would nullify some of the benefits that the Port of London Authority would have to ask for. If hon. Members will go into the matter between now and the Report stage I will do my best to meet them. I believe that enactments which exist are not abrograted in any way except where there is specific provision to the contrary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the right hon. Gentleman if he is prepared to see representatives of the London wharfingers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter between myself and the Members of the Committee. Let us see whether the safeguards are taken away. I do not believe that this Bill in any way relieves the Minister from the obligations of the statutory undertakings of which he may take possession of except as is specifically provided for in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced that the wharfingers are protected, but between now and the Report stage, if the Minister finds, and if we can prove to him, that they need further protection, am I to understand that the! Government will undertake to put in such wording as will protect the wharfingers, so that they shall not be open to undue competition? If this is so, perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Limehouse may see his way to withdraw the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I said was "if protection was withdrawn." I did not say that I would see if they required any further protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. PEARCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Minister has gone a considerable way, but it is evident that he cannot give the wharfingers the same protection that they have
	<span class='label label-info column'>1090</span>
at the present time. They have members of their own on the Port Authority, and they have friends among the rest of the members. Not only have they a voice in the decisions affecting the Port, but the friendly representatives are a great security with regard to their position. The Minister has held out the olive branch, and I hope he will see that it is necessary to give these people in every way he can some sort of security. It is a large interest and they are seriously alarmed. I think I had better withdraw the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Motion and Clause, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>New Clause.</p>
	<p>Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act the following provisions shall apply in relation to the Port of London (hereinafter referred to as "the Port"):
	<ol>
	<li>The provisions of Section fifteen of the Port of London Act, 1908, shall remain in force notwithstanding any taking possession of the Port by the Minister, and shall apply to the Minister as if he had been named therein in place of the Port Authority. If any question arises between the Minister and any person under the said Section, that question shall be determined by the Railway and Canal Commission in manner provided for the determination of other questions referred to the Railway and Canal Commission by this Act.</li>
	<li>In the event of the Minister taking possession of the Port, and during the period of such possession, there shall be substituted for Section twenty-seven of the Port of London Act, 1908, the following enactment, namely:</li></ol></p>
	<p>A complaint may be made to the Railway and Canal Commission by any person interested or any interested trade or section of a trade or any representative association of an interested trade or business that the Minister or the Port Authority are acting in a manner unfairly oppressive to such person or trade or section of a trade by reason of the mode in which the Minister or the Port Authority are carrying on the dock or warehousing business of the Port, including the charges made in respect of such business, and thereupon the question raised by such complaint shall be determined by the Railway and Canal Commission, who may make such order in relation to the subject matter of such complaint as they may think just and reasonable.—[	<i>Sir F. Ball</i>.]</p>
	<p>Brought up, and read the first time.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Clause be read a second time."</p></blockquote>
Section 15 (1) of the Port of London Act, 1908, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Port Authority shall not make any agreement, nor shall they renew any agreement subsisting at the appointed day by which any preferential dues or allowances on vessels or goods, or for discharging the same, are or may be provided for, but, subject and without pre-

	<span class='label label-info column'>1091</span>
judice to any express statutory provision and to any agreements which may be subsisting at the appointed day—"</p></blockquote>
What we want to insure is that the same position is going to operate in the future, after the Port of London Authority passes away and the management passes into the hands of the Ministry of Ways and Communications. I have not yet been convinced, and I can quite see—I am sure my right hon. Friend will not mind my saying this—that preference might under certain circumstances be given to railway steamers. That is a very important fact for the shipowning community of this country. My right hon. Friend has told me, and I accept it, that the railway authorities will only be able to continue the same trade between the same ports as they have heretofore.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And any extension thereof which may be given by Parliament. That is in the wording of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the things we have to be very particular about in fighting against the Orders in Council, because we can quite understand that Ministers desiring to increase the number of steamers under their control would have come along without consulting the House of Commons. They would have made the purchases that were necessary, and increased the number of routes on which steamers were placed, much to the detriment of the British shipowner. We desire that no preference shall be given to the railway steamers. We do not want them to be able to compete unfairly with those owned by private enterprise, and if we can get a Clause to the same effect as paragraph (1), namely, that any of these questions can be referred to the Railway and Canal Commission, we shall have to accept it and be satisfied. With regard to paragraph (2), which relates to the question of unfair trading, this turns in exactly the same manner as the question of the wharfinger? with which I was dealing just now. If my right hon. Friend will refer to Section 27 of the Port of London Act he will see what I am referring to in regard to unfair trading. There again, if my right hon. Friend can accept the suggestion that I have put down in paragraph (2), which would enable this question also to be referred to the Railway and Canal Commission, I think every member of the Committee will admit that that is not asking anything but what is perfectly fair and
	<span class='label label-info column'>1092</span>
equitable. It is not that we are frightened of the Government. I do not want the Government to be under the impression that we think they are desirous of dealing unfairly. But it does not matter who is operating a business concern, if he is going to decide, Aye or No, human nature is bound to come in, and although he may wish to divorce his mind from anything that might be unfair, he cannot help it. He has put on the pair of glasses that suit his own sight best, and it is through those glasses that he sees it. He no doubt will desire to be perfectly fair, but at the same time that is bound to operate, and we want to take all necessary precautions. My Friends behind me will, I think, agree. They wanted a Clause recently which I and many of us thought they ought to have. We want the protection here. I hope my right hon. Friend will agree that we are only asking what is fair and reasonable, and I sincerely trust that he will accept the Clause that I have put down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir RHYS WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are now before the Committee one or two questions, the first of which arises on paragraph (1). I suggest that the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"The provisions of Section fifteen of the Port of London Act, 1908, shall remain in force notwithstanding any taking possession of the Port by the Minister, and shall apply to the Minister as if he had been named therein in place of the Port Authority."</p></blockquote>
are entirely unnecessary and should not be put into the Bill. Section 15 of the Port of London Act, 1908, is a Section in an existing Act, and if the Minister takes over possession of the Port of London, he takes over the powers of that Act, no more and no less. It is, therefore, unnecessary to say here that those powers shall apply to him. The second point is when any question arises between the Minister and any person under Section 15 of the Port of London Act, 1908, the sidenote to which is "Prohibition of Preferential Dock Charges." In Sub-section (	<i>e</i>) of Clause 3 (1) of the newly printed Bill it will be seen that its provisions are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"without prejudice to claims in respect of undue preference under the provisions of the Railway and Canal Traffic Acts."</p></blockquote>
The right of appeal, therefore, in case of any undue preference occasioned by the Acts of the Minister, is there preserved, and it is not necessary to state it again. Paragraph (2) deals with Section 27 of the Port of London Act, 1908, which provides for recourse to the Board of Trade, and it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1093</span>
is suggested here that the recourse should be to the Railway and Canal Commission and not to the Minister. I am instructed by my right hon. Friend that that should be treated in the same category as the provisions under Sub-section (	<i>e</i>) of Clause 3 (1) of the Bill, to which I have just referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. PEARCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does this really mean that the rights of appeal which the wharfingers have under the Port of London Act will be preserved to them under the new Act? It seems to me that there is a danger of the Minister getting powers which the Port of London Authority does not possess, and that the appeals which exist under the Port of London Act on various questions to the Board of Trade and the Railway and Canal Commission may not be preserved. It is a very intricate subject, and I do not pretend to be master of it, but I know that there is a real apprehension amongst this very large class of wharf owners that those rights are not preserved to the full extent. The Minister has made certain promises, and he made a valuable statement just now, but there is a good deal of apprehension. I am afraid there is something in it, and that even now the position of the wharfingers will not be so secure under this Bill as it was under the old Port of London Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The following new Clause stood on the Paper in the name of Sir F. BANBURY:
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>Minister not to carry on Competition against any Company</i>.)</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"No transport services by land or water established, maintained, or worked by the Minister shall at any time be employed for the purposes of competition against any company or companies."</p></blockquote></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1094</span>
	<p>There is nothing ambiguous in the words. They are perfectly feasible and easily understood, and there is no repetition in them with regard to the Act. If all that my hon. and gallant Friend can say is that they are not necessary, and if he has no criticism to offer against them, I consider that my case has been made out, and that the words should be included. My right hon. Friend stated to-day that he is desirous of preserving those interests, and I accept that. But Acts of Parliament are the documents by which the judges have to decide their cases, and we want to have it plainly stated there. With all the millions of money that are invested in this great undertaking, we cannot allow the question to be left in any doubt, and I think my right hon. Friend wants to have it made perfectly clear. Are the rights of the wharfingers preserved at the present time as they were under the Act of 1908? If my right hon. Friend says yes, then perhaps he will put the Clause in. If he has no objection to putting it in the Bill, it seems to me that it would be perfectly easy for him to insert a Clause to the effect that it is understood and agreed that the wharfingers shall have the same rights as were given to them under the Act of 1908. I think that that is not much to ask, and that if the Government are desirous of giving those rights it should be put plainly in the Bill, so that we may know where we are.</p>

Under this Clause, which stands on the Order Paper in the name of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby (Mr. J. H. Thomas), we naturally desire to save the civic rights of employes who will come within the purview of this Bill. I do not know whether it is the intention of the Minister-designate to make any remarks on this Clause, but I formally move it now, without prejudice, in case I may have to rise again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have consulted with the hon. Member and with other Members on the Labour Benches on this subject, and I believe that the statement which it has been suggested should be given will meet their points. It is as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The taking of or retention of possession under Section 3 of this Bill (which is for two years or less) would in no way vitiate the position of transport workers in the matter of their existing civic rights, or their existing rights in the settlement of disputes. Further, any transport workers who may be employed as direct servants of the State on work carried out by the State in connection with new transport services shall be in exactly the same position as if they were the servants of a private undertaking."</p></blockquote>
With this one proviso:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That if in the case of services established by the Ministry any of the transport workers employed in connection with them were to hold an office of profit he would, whatever undertaking had been given, be disqualified from being a Member of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
The ordinary railway servant, however, cannot be said to hold an office, so that in their case disqualification would not arise. The only disqualification is that which refers to holding an office as a Member of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Clause be read a second time."</p></blockquote>
I hope the Government will be prepared to accept this, because I am sure it is important to protect the interests of the local authorities in questions of expenditure. There are many of these local authorities, such as the borough councils, the boards of guardians, the urban district councils and the county councils, which are large spending authorities, and they are all elected by the people as local representatives. I should like to know whether the Government will accept the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am giving you a chance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If they are going to accept it I do not wish to go on. It is a reasonable proposition, and I wish to save discussion. I should like to have the Clause itself, but if words to that effect are put into the Bill I shall be satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that my hon. and gallant Friend put this down to try to draw from the Government some statement as to what their position is with regard to the roads and the local authorities. I do not think there is power in the Bill to compel local authorities to do anything of the kind that he fears. But it would be a mistake to insert this Clause in this precise form. The activities of the local authorities apply not merely to the roads. Some of the local authorities have docks and they have other transport systems, such as light railways, run as light railways and not as tramways, and it may be essential to develop the means of transportation, and that instructions shall be given to the local authorities exactly as they are given to the other great public bodies, on behalf of whom the hon. and gallant Member has been so eloquent. I quite realise that the local authorities are in a special position, and I suggest as a reasonable provision that the Clause should read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in this Act shall give the Minister the power to enforce expenditure upon local authorities against their will, subject to an appeal to the Local Government Board."</p></blockquote>
The Local Government Board is their special guardian and has to sanction their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0554">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

loans, and it will be a reasonable thing to provide that the Local Government Board should act as between the Ministry and the local authorities if it was thought that the Minister was desirous of putting an undue burden upon the local authorities. I suggest the addition of the words "or the consent of the Local Government Board." That would give the right of appeal to the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the Minister for his proposition, but I am afraid he has overlooked the fact that the Local Government Board, as we know it now, will soon be a thing of the past. I do not know who is going to take their place. We are not prepared to commit ourselves to some new authority which is to take the place of the Local Government Board, and which may be able to say to the local authorities, "You have got to have this or leave it." Perhaps the Minister will accept the words, "without the consent of the local authority," and then put in words giving them an appeal to some independent arbitrator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. and gallant Member would be in a better position if he withdrew the Clause than if he accepted the offer to amend it. I am not a lawyer, but I have always understood that you cannot put into a Bill, without the consent of the local authority, any Clause which compels that local authority to spend money. That might be the effect of putting in the Clause with the suggested Amendment. If you put the Clause in it would be a Clause that did not mean anything. If you say that nothing in this Act shall be done about a thing, it would have reference to something with respect to which there is a Clause already in the Bill enabling the Minister to do that thing. It is proposed to put in an Amendment that an instruction may be given, and that I am afraid would bring about conflicts between different Government Departments. Under the Bill there is no power to do anything of that kind, and I ask the hon. Member whether it is really desirable to have these conflicts between Government Departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander J. DAWES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put my name down to this proposed Clause as representing a part of London which has an undue proportion of main roads. We want to be sure that the Bill does not give power to insist upon local authorities spending
	<span class='label label-info column'>1098</span>
money on roads. We do not think that they should be compelled to spend out of their own resources money on main roads which are not within their own district, and would be used for through traffic. In reply to the suggestion of Sir Frederick Banbury, I would refer him to Sub-section (	<i>d</i>) of Clause 3 in the reprinted Bill, which says that the Minister is given powers under the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act. I am prepared to accept the suggestion that there shall be some form of appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sub-section (	<i>d</i>) refers to "any undertaking," but the roads are not "undertakings."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sub-clause (	<i>d</i>) enables any direction to be given by the Minister under Sub-section (	<i>c</i>). The Minister cannot do anything unless he has taken possession of the undertaking. Subsection (	<i>d</i>) cannot apply to roads. I certainly do not think they are statutory undertakings. I have consulted General Maybury as to what is the existing state of the law, and he says there is no power given to compel local authorities to spend any money at all</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to point out that where the Minister may take possession, say, of the wharves of a harbour, there may be approaches to those wharves owned by the local authority. Here is a case in point. All the wharves and quays in Newcastle belong to the corporation, and so do the roads. The wharves are all right, but the approaches are bad. We want money spent there. The same may happen in London. If you go down to the Monument below London Bridge you will find in Tower Street and Custom House Street that the thoroughfares require a lot of money to be spent upon them. If the right hon. Gentleman is so much concerned because there is nothing in the Bill giving him this power, I do not see how he can possibly offer any objection to this Clause. This Bill is a great Bill. The Minister has enormous powers already. The local authorities do not know where they stand, and the Minister himself probably does not grasp how much authority he really has. As far as we in Newcastle are concerned, we maintain that we ought not to be called upon to spend large sums of money on approaches to the wharves which belong to the State. We want to know who is going to pay for it, and whether such alterations are to be remunerative or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ROWLANDS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the Minister has accepted the principle that local authorities require some protection, and he has tried to meet to some extent the wishes of the Mover of the Clause, but I think with the hon. Member for the City of London that to have two Government authorities fighting one another is a bad principle. I do not agree with the opinion that when the Local Government Board goes out of existence there is no other body to take its place. The new Ministry will take over bodily the whole of the powers. I cannot see that we shall remain in a state of chaos for long if the powers of the Local Government Board are to remain in existence. I would like to ask the Minister if he cannot go a little further, and, to satisfy the local authorities, offer some other court of appeal rather than the Local Government Board. He has shown us already that he is prepared to meet the principle underlying the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the constituency that I represent we are very badly hit in the matter of roads. In my borough we have two very large stations belonging to two Southern railway companies. The approach roads are used by heavy goods traffic. We have, further, three Southern main roads, with three main bridges across the Thames, where the traffic again is very heavy. I do not think the local authority would object to an order upon them to do certain things as regards the roads, provided the Ministry would pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is quite within the bounds of possibility that my right hon. Friend may want to place on local authorities certain burdens involving increased expenditure. My right hon. Friend—and I appreciate the way he has met us—has seen my point, and I hope he will see now whether he can discover some independent arbitrator on the matter. All these municipalities are more or less under the control of the Local Government Board, and some of these authorities may be a little diffident of upsetting the desires of that Board. If the Minister will take the Clause as it is, or bring it up as a new Clause with some alteration, we might be satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F.

It is in contradiction to the Clause just passed, because it will compel a local authority to spend money. Take the case of a district or county council. There is a little stream in their area and over the stream a bridge which has upon it, "This bridge is calculated to carry not more than three tons." It may be that someone from a neighbouring big town has a heavy traction engine. He wants To use the bridge, and may endeavour to make the council spend a considerable sum in strengthening it. In the ordinary course he would go to a court of law, and the court would be for the district council. But this Clause would allow an appeal to the Minister, and the Minister could order the council to spend the money. As the hon. Gentleman says, it is in absolute contradiction to the Clause just passed.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think in effect the Government can accept the Clause put down by my hon. Friend.

Then it will continue, "subject to any statutory modifications thereof then in force."

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WATERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Clause be read a second time."</p></blockquote>
This is a Clause that intends to deal with the question of the management of these undertakings. It is contemplated, I believe, that the Minister-designate should appoint commissioners. I think, from my own observation, that this particular Clause will make his task very much easier and would be an incentive to him to work with a spirit of unity between the rank and file and those in higher spheres under his jurisdiction. There may be just one or two points to which it would be well to draw the attention of the Committee. You will note that it states that of the Commissioners appointed for the purpose, three shall be appointed on nominations submitted by trade unions whose members comprise persons employed under the Ministry. I do not know whether the Committee is aware of the fact that there is to a large degree amidst the working class a great desire, when these large concerns come under the control of the nation, that they shall give their experience and their knowledge of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1104</span>
the undertaking for the good of the community. Looking at it from that point of view, I think that not only this Committee but the Minister-designate ought to appreciate the desire of these men. We believe that private firms in the past have too much neglected those who have done the work according to the orders that have been given, and that there is a great amount of brain and faculty neglected that should be utilised for the good of the community. I know full well that there are men who have been in the service of companies forty or fifty years and over. Who is there who will say that these men are not qualified to give their experience for the benefit of carrying out this Bill? I hope the Minister will see his way to meet us on this question, and that when he appoints the Commissioners he will see the advisability of applying the provisions of this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite clear what the Clause means. The wording is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The actual management of undertakings of which possession has been retained or taken by the Minister shall be conducted"</p></blockquote>
in such and such a way. If that means that when the Minister takes possession of an undertaking he is to displace the present board of management or the present managing officials and to put in a new board of management or a new set of officials during the two years, I do not think that would really be a practical proposition. I have every sympathy with the views of the workers that they should be consulted in the work of which they have particular experience or for which they have particular qualifications, but I am not quite sure that I would care to say that the management of undertakings should be as to half from nominees of trade unions. That is quite a new principle. I do not think I would care now to commit myself to it—either in the case of trade unions or anybody else. I do not think you can say that any society should have the right to nominate managers irrespective of the views of the Minister. Having regard to the fact that it is a two years' provision it would be inconceivable that the management of a port authority, say the Clyde, should be taken out of hand for those two years and that a completely new lot of six men new to the Clyde, possibly, should be put in to displace the others, and then that they should come
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0558">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1105</span>
out if control or possession ceases. Whatever there is to say for this, I hope it will not be pressed as a two years' provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I oppose this Clause. I do not think the hon. Member who proposes this can have any conception of what he is asking. Take the instance of the Clyde. What do they know about the charging of dues on the Clyde? What do they know about engineering and the channels of the Clyde? Ml the matter of labour on the Clyde is based on the carrying out of the orders to dig or to build—plumbers, joiners, and all these. These interests are going to be protected by the Minister. He has agreed to put Labour members on to this Advisory Committee, but it would be monstrous to turn out all the management of these docks, and to put on six new members—three of them Labour—to decide all these important questions, on the same level as those representing the other sides of the interests. I can only say this to my Friends on the other side, that they did not seem to have very much courage when they had a fine chance to go to Chepstow and show what they could do. That was a case in which they might have shown their capacity for management. But do not let us be diverted—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do not let us discuss Chepstow on this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not discussing it, but, with all deference, references to cognate subjects are brought in by nearly every speaker, and I do not think I should be reflected upon because I happen to give that as an instance of where my Friends might have shown what they could do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make an appeal to the Committee. With your co-operation we can get to the end of the Order Paper to-day, so that we shall have a clean slate tomorrow to start on the Compensation Clause, and next week for the Wagon Clause. We have still a great deal to do, and I shall want your help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SWAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We on these benches are not content that the Labour movement shall simply work on advisory committees. We think the time has come when Labour ought to take a part in the control of the affairs and the destinies of the nation, and not simply sit by and be dictated to by men who, we believe, have neither the special ability nor the acquired knowledge to conduct the affairs of the nation as efficiently as the nation desires them to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1106</span>
be conducted. As the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Waterson) has mentioned, we have men of special ability and acquired knowledge who will be a great acquisition to the Minister in the successful conduct of these schemes, and we have-seen time and time again that men have-been appointed to conduct affairs who. have not had the requisite knowledge to make the schemes a success. We think it. would be very silly not to extend this principle to comply with the request of the Labour Members on these benches, because there is a growing opinion that if that is not done the Labour movement wilt not work with this scheme with so much harmony as it otherwise would. The hon. Member on the other side (Sir W. Raeburn) suggests that we do not know how to organise and conduct this scheme. But if the various classes of working men do not understand it, who does? I think the time has come when they ought to be given control, and I think they will be an acquisition to this great scheme instead of a failure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Labour representatives do make a request they are certainly not afflicted with modesty. They make a very large request here, and I would like to point out that what they ask is that these nominations shall be on behalf of the trade unions. I know men, connected with great undertakings who are Labour men, but they are not members of a trade union. The members of trade unions seem to ignore all other Labour except themselves. Some of the best men I know in connection with Labour do not belong to any of the great industries, such as mining or the transport services, and are not members of trade unions. Why should they be shut out by a Clause of this description? The modesty of the hon. Members is still further shown in the fact that the number of Commissioners laid down is six, and that one of their number is to act as chairman. If three members are nominated by the trade unions and three are otherwise nominated, we may find that a trade union member is to be the chairman and have the casting vote. Then the last part of the Clause states that the Commissioners shall be required to give the whole of their time to their duties, and that each shall be paid as a remuneration for his services a similar amount. This is a very large question. After the Chairman's appeal that we should expedite discussion,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0559">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1107</span>
I cannot imagine that the Committee will seriously entertain this proposal. Certainly it raises such very important questions that a considerable time will be required to debate it, but I venture to think that the Committee will see that it is not meant sincerely. I should not like to call it a "try on," but it is a political move of far-reaching consequences, and no doubt</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>"The period of three years and six months from the passing of this Act shall be substituted for the period specified in Section two, Subsection (3), of the Special Acts (Extension of Time) Act, 1915, with respect to all undertakings to which this Act applies."—[	<i>Sir F. Banbury</i>.]</p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Clause be read a second time."</p></blockquote>
Certain undertakings which may be taken over by the Minister have already had the period of their powers for coming to Parliament to create new works extended, and this Clause is merely for the purpose of extending it for a short further period. I understand that, subject to a certain Amendment, which clearly enacts that it shall apply only to undertakings taken over by the Government, the Government are prepared to accept it, and I accordingly beg to move that it be read a second time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no experience here, but I do know from experience outside that a Clause of this sort is apt to get into an Act without its being thoroughly understood, and I should like to hear further from the right hon. Baronet what its meaning is. I take it to mean that the railways which have been taken over by the Government for two years are, by this small Clause, to be continued for a further period of eighteen months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. May I make the meaning quite clear? Any port or dock, or any other undertaking, which has to come to Parliament in order to obtain powers to make extensions or to create new works has already, during the War, had that power extended for a certain given period—that is to say, whenever they have an act enabling them to come to Parliament, the Act generally states that they must make their application or do the work within a given period. That period has been extended during the War for a certain time. This Clause does not apply specially to railways, but applies to all other undertakings which have to come to Parliament, and all that it does is to further extend that period for a short time, so that the powers which they have, but which perhaps they will not have been able to exercise while the Government are In control, may not lapse should the under-

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out that on that occasion we were told that the Amendment could not be dealt with at that stage. It was for that reason that I put this Clause down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member will find that the Amendment was negatived on a Division.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Clause be read a second time."</p></blockquote>
This deals with a point which was raised in a previous discussion, regarding the Metropolitan Police licences for omnibuses and cabs in London. The Home Secretary then said that, under Clause 2, Sub-section (1), powers are taken for the new Minister to retransfer these duties. We are very anxious that the traffic authorities should be under the control of one person, and that the new Minister should be in control, and I wish to prevent the Minister from retransferring his powers to any other new Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause just proposed provides that the Minister shall become the licensing authority, and that he must not get rid of that power to any other authority, but in no case will the Minister or the Ministry be the licensing authority. It is not intended at all that he should do that class of work. It would be a huge and unwieldy body if we were to take that kind of work. It will be found on page 7 of the Bill, Section (4) of Clause 4 as amended, that there is an appeal from the licensing authority to the Minister, both as regards refusals and conditions, and that I think meets the hon. Gentleman's point. I do not underestimate the importance of the London traffic and it will receive the fullest attention, but if you were to make the Minister the licensing authority fox vehicles it would be totally unworkable. I hope the hon. Member will accept this statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There are in London many places where more than one tramway authority exists, and it has been found impossible in cer-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1112</span>
tain cases to get through-running between them. The object of the Clause is to enable the Minister to command the authorities controlling these tramways to give through-running facilities whenever that is desirable You have to go by several different services to get by tramway into Kent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can accept this Clause if the words used by the hon. Member just now were put into it, so that a "command" could be given. I would not like to use such a word myself, but I suggest instead the word "require" instead of "grant permission." That would give us some initiative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause read a second time.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, to leave out the words "grant permission for" and to insert instead thereof the word "require."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that this refers to cases where tramways which are in different hands are running on parallel lines. It does not mean any new construction. It only applies to existing tramways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It deals with through-running, and does not cover new construction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major PRESCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the district of Tottenham there is the Metropolitan electric tramway system and again at Hackney and Stamford Hill. There are also tramway lines running out of London belonging to the London County Council. The same applies to Shoreditch, where people have to change cars. There is no through-running agreement between the London County Council and the Metropolitan tramway system. Will this affect cases of that kind? Does the Minister propose to enforce the powers of through-running where tramways are controlled by various local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put down a Clause which I understand has the sympathy of the Minister, dealing with a separate Department for roads. It was put down after some consultation with him, but it was not possible for me to be here in order to move it as there was no indicator to show when it was coming on, and I was busy in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That should have been done in the Committee stage, and I think it would be better for the hon. Member to see the Minister as to whether anything can be done on the Report stage.

We have now passed the stage when anything can be done. Perhaps Sir Eric Geddes will make a statement with regard to the business tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If we are finished with them before six o'clock we shall then adjourn until Tuesday, when I hope we shall be in a position to deal with the Wagon Clause.
