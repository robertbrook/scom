	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(Power to Require Statistics and Returns.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>It shall be the duty of the owners of any railway, light railway, tramway, canal, inland navigation, dock, harbour, pier, or electricity undertaking, and the authority or person liable to maintain any road or bridge, to furnish to the Minister at such times and in such manner and form as he may direct, such accounts, statistics, and returns as he may require for the purpose of his powers and duties under this Act.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, after the word "may" ["may direct"] to insert the word "reasonably."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The SECRETARY of STATE for the HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. Shortt)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have often discussed the question of putting in the word "reasonably." The real trouble is that it might lead to such delay in arriving at a decision as to what was reasonable. If there is a dispute as to what is reasonable you have got to have some litigation and some tribunal to determine the question. I have explained the position on this point so frequently that I hope that my hon. Friend will not think me discourteous if I do not do it again. It is purely a question of delay. I am quite sure that while, on the one hand, very few of the authorities would desire to take an unreasonable view of what "reasonable" meant, at the same time you might have trouble, and therefore it is very much better to trust each other and to avoid anything like delay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not press the point. The question is who is going to trust whom? You [the Government] want always to be trusted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain HAMILTON BENN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, at the end, to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that the Minister shall repay to such owners all costs incurred in the preparation of such accounts, statistics and returns."</p></blockquote>
I may point out that Sub-section (9) was deleted from Clause 3 by the Government. I am not clear why, as Clause 6 still stands. Perhaps the Home Secretary will be able to explain that in his reply. I have no
	<span class='label label-info column'>824</span>
wish to hamper the Ministry in any way in regard to the preparation of statistics. I appreciate fully the importance of statisties in this undertaking, but we know that the Minister-designate has strong views on the subject of statistics. I can remember that at one period of the War it became almost a question whether we should ask for an armistice, while the Navy prepared statistics. I am connected with the Port of London Authority. We have already six systems of accounts. We have five dock sets and one river set of accounts to keep up. The staff of the Authority is worked to the last point possible, keeping the accounts which have to be kept for the actual working of the authorities. If it is desired that a large quantity of statisties should be supplied for the purpose of the Ministry the cost of setting up a new Department for these statistics—for it would involve doing so—should be borne by the National Exchequer and not by the individual authority concerned. These statistics are supplied for purposes of national work and not for the purposes of the Authority itself. Therefore the cost should be borne by the Ministry. It also has the additional advantage of showing what the Ministry actually costs. The expense of running the Ministry should not be spread over all the undertakings involved, but should be concentrated in the Ministry itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sub-section (9) was dropped out of Clause 6 because Clause 6 was not dropped, and we did not want both. With regard to the suggestion itself, I do not think that it is reasonable. There are very many Acts of Parliament which involve the keeping of accounts by undertakings in a particular form, and I never yet heard a suggestion that the cost of keeping those accounts, which are necessary for the undertaking, and not necessary for the Government—the form may be necessary for Government purposes, but the accounts themselves are essential for the undertaking—should be borne by the taxpayer. I may remind my hon. Friend of what he and those who are interested in docks proposed when it was a question not of docks, but of railways. They propose that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the accounts kept by the Ministry of each railway undertaking of which possession is claimed or taken under this Act shall show separately as far as practicable such items of receipt and expenditure on capital and revenue accounts as are wholly or mainly attributable to any dock forming part of any such railway undertaking."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>825</span>
There was no question of the State paying for those accounts, but they went on to put plainly that the private docks want to see how they compare with what we call the railway docks. That was a clear indication that the accounts would be just as useful to them as to the State. That must be so. One of the main purposes of the Ministry will be to assist those undertakings which cannot do it themselves to come into line. How is the Ministry to know what undertaking requires help and what help should be given unless the undertakings keep accounts to show it? Moreover, the Ministry must be able to lay down what the form of accounts must be, because if you are going to have uniformity in all forms of transport you must have uniformity of accounts. They are really undertaking accounts; but the form should be laid down by the Minister for the purpose of co-ordination and unity all over the country. Therefore I hope that the hon. Member will not press this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend, like myself, is a lawyer, and lawyers are proverbially unfamiliar with accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speak for yourself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have to obtain all kinds of details in order to get proper cognisance of them for the purposes of their work. I have had some experience of the accounts required by the Government from a county council and to my own knowledge a staff have been engaged specially to keep the accounts which, since the War, have been called for by Government Departments from that county council alone, and I can appreciate the objections raised by the undertaking to having to embark upon fresh accounts. It is all very well for the Home Secretary to suggest that everything in these new accounts is what will be required by these various undertakings. In practice it will be found that the Minister in control would be the same type of person as the other Ministers set up during the War who require all sorts of extraordinary forms of accounts, and require the accounts themselves to be reconstituted and kept in totally different form. If you were in the Middlesex Guildhall, which is quite close, I could show you an enormous bundle of accounts, probably it would require a cart to bring them over, which we have had to keep to meet the requirements of various public depart-
	<span class='label label-info column'>826</span>
ments, and which are not merely duplicated but are repeated a half dozen times over. I think that the Government might reconsider the Amendment if, with the consent of my hon. Friend it were altered to apply only to such accounts as are not in existence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out that really, in order to arrive at any estimate or any knowledge of which were new accounts and which were not accounts merely changed in form and therefore not more expensive, would cost the undertaking more to make their claim against the Government than it would to have to pay the infinitesimal amount that can be put down for an undertaking for any new kind of account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment. The Home Secretary has referred to the Amendment which we moved in regard to railway accounts and which was moved with quite a different object. The Home Secretary and the Minister-designate know very well that that Amendment was moved because we wanted to get the account of the railway docks specially set out in order to know if the railway docks paid as docks. Those of us who are connected with harbour authorities know very well that you have lump railway and dock rates given by the railway companies, and that those rates are cut rates and do not pay the cost of the harbours, which they use for that through rate. Clause 6 says, "to furnish to the Minister, at such times and in such manner and form as he may direct, such accounts, statistics, and returns as he may require." The Home Secretary did not mean to suggest that harbour authorities do not keep proper sets of accounts, but under this Clause, I take it, that the Minister-designate can order an Authority absolutely to change their whole system of book-keeping, to keep quite a different set of forms, and to have quite different records. No harbour authority will object to the Minister asking for an ordinary return, and if he asks for a return about our traffic or our dues or our trade it could be given from our present accounts, but I should like to ask members of this Committee who have had during the War any connection with Government Departments to support the Amendment. Everybody knows that the authorities who had dealings with the Munitions Department had
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>827</span>
to supply as many as ten or twelve invoices on different coloured forms in order to satisfy the particular whims of that particular Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel THORNE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about duck shoving?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that was one of the easiest ways by which you could duck shove, instead of having straightforward accounts. The Government Departments throughout the War demanded the most absurd kind of accounts and forms to be kept and filled up at the expense of the authorities, and we want to prevent the new Ministry from following the very bad example of some of those Departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. PEARCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think anyone who has had to work under Government control during the War must see there is something in the request which is made in the Amendment. I speak feelingly. For a good many years lately I have been working under Government control, and everybody in the whole business has been disturbed by the needless quantity of forms and accounts that have been required by the Government. Something is required for the protection of the undertakings which are coming under the new Ministry. Unreasonable accounts are demanded, and an enormous amount of unnecessary work has very usually been required. If the Home Secretary objects to the word "reasonable" he ought to do something to meet the situation that everyone has had to put up with during the last few years. There is a great deal more in it than he appears to imagine. I think he has been fortunate to escape having to work under Government control, but I am sure that every member of the Committee who has been put in that sort of position does realise that some sort of protection ought to be given to the undertakings which are coming under the Ministry, that they shall not be unduly hampered by unnecessary statistics and figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTONE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment. I quite appreciate that the Ministry must have accounts rendered to them. If they are going to exercise control they must know what the accounts are, but I support the Amendment because if the cost of preparing those accounts is to be saddled on the undertaking we shall have a repetition of the objectionable
	<span class='label label-info column'>828</span>
method of piling up duplicate invoices that has afflicted every undertaking that has had anything to do with Government Departments during the War. If the cost of the preparation of those accounts is to be cast upon the Ministry, then they will surely adopt some simpler way of getting their accounts, and they will be more careful of the form and manner in which the accounts are presented, than if they cast the obligation on the Authority without rhyme or reason or without any regard to economy at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. CHAMBERLAIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise for the purpose of begging my right hon. Friends to give some serious attention to the principle which underlies this Amendment. I moved an Amendment myself yesterday which would have had the effect of excluding from this Clause any tramway owned by a local authority, and although such tramways have been up to now entirely excluded from the purview of this Bill, my right hon. Friend, exhibiting that spirit of reasonableness to which we are invited to trust, refused to accept my Amendment, and brought those tramways into the scope of this Clause. That inclines me to feel that something of this kind is really very necessary, because if bodies of this kind, which are not really intended to be dealt with at all, are to be called upon to render accounts, returns, and statistics, I do not think it is reasonable that they should be made to do it at their own expense. I see the practical difficulty of the Amendment as it stands, and I certainly do not want to see anything put into the Bill which will impose upon owners unnecessary labour in making out details of a claim against the Department, but I think it might be left to the discretion of owners to make a claim if they really had a substantial case, and therefore I want to suggest alternative words which might perhaps meet the case. My suggestion is that the words should be "provided that the Minister shall be liable to repay to such owners any extra costs involved in the preparation of such accounts, statistics, and returns."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to appeal to my hon. Friend to withdraw his Amendment in favour of this one, which I hope the Government will recognise as a genuine attempt at a reasonable compromise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>829</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CHAMBERLAIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, at the end, to add the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that the Minister shall be liable to repay to such owners any extra cost involved in the preparation of such accounts, statistics and returns."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. BARTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to oppose this Amendment. I feel that the Bill is largely an exploring Bill on which great permanent decisions will ultimately be taken. "We all recognise that statistics are absolutely necessary, so it is really a question as to the Government paying for the extra work, and that would seem to me to be introducing a new principle into an Act of Parliament and to be opening a very wide door, which in a purely tentative Bill would, in my opinion, be entirely unjustified. These authorities will undoubtedly be put to some little extra trouble, but I think it is very greatly exaggerated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Come and see for yourself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. BARTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One has some experience of these things, and undoubtedly, whilst we are all in a frame of mind to resent calls made upon us by the Government, there is a strong body of opinion that many of these statistics, at which we have cavilled to begin with, have been found ultimately to be extremely useful. In this matter certainly statistics are absolutely necessary. It has been contended that if the Government has to pay there would likely be a less demand for statistics, but I think it might have exactly the reverse effect. So long as the authorities are paying they have a strong case for claiming that such statistics as are asked for shall be reasonable, but if the Government pays they will exercise an amount of control and intervention which might become extremely burdensome. But my objection is to the principle of the Government being asked to undertake this new departure, which in my judgment would be a grave mistake in legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major STEEL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the Amendment, which I feel is a reasonable one. I do not think we have a very good example in the enormous cost of preparing statistics in reply to the questions which are every day asked in Parliament. I understand that the cost of each question which is asked of a Minister in Parliament amounts to some pounds. There is no doubt about it that there is a great deal of opposition in the country to
	<span class='label label-info column'>830</span>
this Bill, and I think the principal opposition is on account of the bureaucracy which is going to be set up under the Bill, and the people of this country are absolutely tired of bureaucratic government. I feel that the Government ought to accept the Amendment, because I think it is to a certain extent a safeguard against harsh, bureaucratic control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not worth while wasting any more time over. The Amendment refers to any extra cost which is incurred. I quite agree that it is a very bad principle to start, but if the Mover of the Amendment will agree to put in words limiting this to the two years' experimental period, so that it may not be taken as a precedent for the future, well and good. Then, if they can show that necessary experiment to get statistics has cost, say, the Port of London an extra hundred a year, the Ministry would be very glad to pay it and save them from bankruptcy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CHAMBERLAIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause as it stands limits it, because it says "The powers and duties under this Act," which really refers to the two years' period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>Question proposed, "That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask who has control of the order in which Amendments are put down, for it does seem to me rather strange that when there is an Amendment to leave out the whole Clause it should be put at the end. Look at the position. You are discussing Amendments to Clause 6, perhaps, for an hour or two, and then you come to an Amendment to leave it out. It seems to me that, after you have discussed Amendments to the Clause, it is out of order to move the deletion of the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a custom as old as the House of Commons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a business man I think it is very inconvenient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You must get the Standing Orders altered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to make a suggestion. I have already made it to my right hon. Friend in charge of the Bill, and I think it would facilitate the progress of the Bill. It appears from the Order
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>831</span>
Paper that we shall probably complete the discussion to-day of all Amendments on the various Clauses, and then there are on the Order Paper about twenty pages of new Clauses. I am going to suggest to my right hon. Friend opposite that it would be to the benefit of the progress of the Bill if as soon as we have cleared away all the Amendments, we should adjourn until Tuesday, in order to enable us to consult privately with regard to the new Clauses, and perhaps knock some of the Amendments to the new Clauses and the new Clauses together, and be ready to push the Bill through in the course of next week. A similar course was adopted last week, when some hon. Friends and myself held a long sitting in another Committee Room, which resulted in a very important Amendment being thrashed into shape, and being passed without comment when the Committee next met. Another reason for the proposal I have to make is that one of the most important new Clauses—namely, that relating to compensation, has not appeared on the Order Paper. I am not in the least imputing any blame to my right hon. Friends. I know it was impossible, owing to the necessity of consulting the Treasury, to get that Clause ready, but, of course, it would be really impossible to go on discussing new Clauses when perhaps the most vital Clause of all is not on the Order Paper. I would, therefore, venture to suggest to my right hon. Friend that, as soon as we have cleared away the Amendments to the Clauses, the Committee should adjourn until Tuesday morning, in order to facilitate the progress of the Amendments to-day and of the new Clauses next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite appreciate the proposal made by my hon. Friend. Of course, the sooner we get through the remaining Amendments, the longer time we shall have to devote to what I quite agree will be very useful work in coming to some sort of agreement on the new Clauses. Many of those new Clauses really touch matters of great importance in the Bill, and my view is—of course, I am entirely in the hands of the Committee—that it would be. advantageous if we did adjourn in the way proposed. Of course the Committee would give us all our Amendments first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having got those Amendments, I think possibly an adjournment
	<span class='label label-info column'>832</span>
which would enable us to meet any interests concerned, and go into the question of the new Clauses, might be advantageous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my right hon. Friend says "give us all our Amendments" he means, of course, discuss them, but not necessarily carry them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I mean that the adjournment would not take place until we had got to the end of the discussion on the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think at the conclusion of the Amendments would be the proper place for the Home Secretary, or someone, to move that the Committee adjourn until Tuesday morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Home Secretary says "give us the Amendments" he means to the existing Clauses? He does not mean on the new Clauses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain HAMILTON BENN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to say a word about the speech of the Home Secretary in giving the Amendment which he gave just now. I think it really showed that he really did not appreciate the seriousness of the matter at all. I should be very much surprised if the bill for these statistics does not come to many, many thousands a year before we are through with it, and the suggestion that he made that the accounts of the authorities were not kept in a proper and business like manner is not really worthy of him. The accounts of the Port Authority are kept in the most admirable manner, and for all the practical purposes of working they are kept thoroughly. It is suggested that another form of accounts might be called for, not once, but as often as the Minister thinks, fit, and that will involve undoubtedly setting up a new Department for it entirely, and I think that that matter ought to be thoroughly understood. It is not one of those light and small matter the Home Secretary suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make a suggestion? It is quite evident that there is something in the minds of hon. Members opposite with regard to this Clause which I cannot appreciate. I suggest to the Committee that this Amendment should be accepted and Clause 6 be—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I move this for the purpose of asking the Minister what he intends to appoint in the way of secretaries, officers and servants of the Ministry. There is a very great fear throughout the country at the increase of bureaucracy which has been going on. There are rumours that my right hon. Friend is making large demands for office accommodation. I heard the other day the rumour—I do not know whether it is true or not—that there is a demand for certain Government offices for at least 400 clerks as a beginning. We want to know from my right hon. Friend if he can give any idea of the staff he is going to have in connection with this new Department. All kinds of rumours are floating about varying from tens to thousands of officials. I do not want to tie him down to say exactly how many, but I ask him for some sort of idea, and I think the House of Commons, whose main function is the guardianship of the public purse, should have, before parting with this Bill in Committee, some sort of idea from the right hon. Gentleman upon
	<span class='label label-info column'>836</span>
what lines he is going to run this new Department, how far it is going to be merely a consultative department with himself and a few clerks, merely to get together statistics and to formulate a policy, which could be done with quite a small staff, or whether he is really going to set about the taking over of these great undertakings, and manage them with the vast staff that would be necessary? For the purpose, therefore, of eliciting a statement, I move this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it must be obvious to the Committee that, in the first place, it would be quite impossible to frame any idea of the staff required to run the Department until one knows what the Department has got to do. Until this Bill is through Committee it is impossible to say what its functions shall be As to the rumours that are flying about I expect, like most rumours, that they have as little foundation. I have not made any estimate of the staff required; at this stage it will be quite impossible to do so—even if one knew exactly what the scope of the Ministry would be under the Bill. If some of the Amendments which are down as to advisory committees and continual references to them are carried, that would have a very great influence upon the numbers of staff required and of new Ministers. It is impossible to frame any idea now. The number 400 which has been mentioned would, I think, allow for a comparatively small increase in the numbers which will automatically be transferred. With the functions of the existing Departments I do not think 400 is a figure which need alarm my hon. Friend or the Committee, because the numbers transferred will be very much proportionate. It will be impossible for anyone, even my hon. and learned Friend, with all his anxiety as to the number, to give any estimate to-day of what the staff of the Ministry will be. During the two years, or at least a period of two years, has to elapse until the position of the transportation undertakings is decided upon, and approved by Parliament, I do not imagine the staff will be a very large one. But if we are embarking eventually upon a system, of State Railways, State Docks, and State Canals, the staff throughout the country will be a very large one indeed. During the investigating period I do not think it will be a very large one, although there will be a certain amount of technical work done which will require a technical staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the statement of the Minister is very satisfactory. He is taking tremendous powers. There is no definition as to how many secretaries shall be appointed. It may be an unlimited number. I have been told, it may not be on the very best authority, that this Department is going to take over the Ministry of Shipping, St. James's Park. I should like to know whether or not that is true?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They tried, but I think did not succeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are tremendous buildings there, and the labyrinth of passages is bewildering. If they take it over it will be an enormous addition. I think the Minister ought to agree that there should be some Committee to advise in this matter so that it is not left absolutely to Ms power. The Sub-section says: "the Minister shall appoint …. subject to the consent of the Treasury." What the Treasury will say I do not know. In a matter of this description the right hon. Gentleman should consent to somebody or some Committee: it is a large undertaking. I should like to have definitely confirmed or the reverse the rumour, which is rather more than a rumour, referring to the Ministry of Shipping buildings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTONE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appeal to my hon. and learned Friend to withdraw his Amendment. It is quite obvious that if this Ministry is to be set up the Minister must have the powers that are sought to be conferred upon him in the Bill. The assurance the right hon. Gentleman has given us would suggest the Amendment should be withdrawn. [HON. MEMBERS: "Agreed."] It is quite impossible for the Minister to carry on unless he has these powers that are given him under this Sub-section. I think we may rely upon what he says as to the smallness of the staff during the two years of investigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree. It is impossible to carry on the Bill without the Sub-section, but I moved my Amendment for the purpose of a declaration on the part of the Minister. I have not been very successful. Still we must be thankful for small mercies. In order to get on with the work I ask leave to withdraw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1) after the word "number"
	<span class='label label-info column'>838</span>
["of the Treasury as to number"], to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"and with the approval of the appointments committee hereinafter referred to."</p></blockquote>
This Amendment is an endeavour to do something to check the political influence of patronage. Some time or another the House of Commons will have to deal with this question, and the only way I can think of is by dealing with it in individual Bills. The Minister has told us it is quite impossible to give us information about the staffs. At the time he takes over various great undertakings he may have an enormous staff. Meantime, in the case of the railways, docks, harbours, tramways, canals and so on, under the conditions of this and similar Bills, the whole patronage is in the hands of the Minister. We know what that means. Quite frankly we as Members of Parliament know that we shall be pestered by our constituents asking us to see the Minister to try to get one appointed as secretary, another as deputy manager, and so and so. It may go as far down the scale as a porter at a railway station. If we are going to have the nationalisation of everything, whether it is railways or whatever else, quite frankly, I think we will all admit it is essential that Parliament should make an endeavour at the earliest possible moment to stop that kind of political pressure, or, again, frankly, it will be political jobbery. It is a very horrible thing to think that all this patronage will be in the hands of the Minister. I do not think my right hon. Friend would want it himself. I think he would probably say: "A plague on you Members of Parliament coming to badger me about appointments all over the country from one end to the other." "It is all in my hands" (says the Minister), and, of course, it is very difficult to say "no" to Members of Parliament, although perhaps the right hon. Gentleman may have the power to say "no" more than another Minister might. I do not know whether it would be possible to establish some sort of Appointments Committees such as I have suggested. I propose in the next Amendment to constitute a Committee consisting of two members to be appointed by the Minister; two members to be appointed by the Committee of Selection of the House of Commons; one member to be appointed by the Treasury; and one member to be appointed by the Civil Service Commissioners; and I should be pleased to add one or two appointed by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>839</span>
Ministry of Labour. I do not care how the Committee is constituted, but we should have someone, apart from political pressure so that we may be able to write to our constituents and friends, and say "We cannot exercise political pressure in this matter." I would like to see the thing go so far as to make it an offence on the part of Members of Parliament to try to get at Ministers or the Appointments Committee in appointments of this kind. This is the first occasion I have had to move this Amendment. It is of vital importance at the present time, and of even more vital importance as nationalisation of various projects go on. I think the right hon. Gentleman will agree that this Amendment does not in any way take away his power of appointment, or is detrimental to the Bill. I am not pledged to this identical composition of the Committee, but I ask hon. Members to help to do away with jobbery and corruption throughout the great services of our great country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be—I will not discuss it now—a very great deal in the principle of what my hon. and learned Friend has said. I think it must be obvious, however, that this is far too big a question to bring in on an Amendment to a Bill of this description. If it has to be raised at all it ought to be raised by a Bill dealing with the whole Civil Service. This is not the way really such a big change ought to be brought about. To begin with, my hon. and learned Friend will know—and I say it in no offensive sense—he has not thoroughly thought out the Amendment, or the form the Committee should take. It cannot refer to everybody. There must be some Civil servant appointments left to the discretion of the head of the Department. It may be a very good thing if appointment committees of this kind are introduced into our Civil Service as a whole. I do not want to go into this matter, but I would suggest to the Committee that a great constitutional change of this description is not to be brought about by an Amendment which has not been really thoroughly thought out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out to the right hon. Gentleman that this Bill is only of a temporary character. He tells us it is impossible to say exactly what staff will be required. We can all see how secretaries and so on may be appointed. What, how-
	<span class='label label-info column'>840</span>
ever, I want to know is how are they going to be got rid of at the end of the two years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel THORNE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Give them notice in the usual way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, or we might pay them the unemployment donation. But I would point out that the Bill is only of a temporary character. It has nothing to do with the ordinary Civil Service appointments. A Committee of this description or something very much like it ought, I think, to be appointed in view of the temporary character of the Bill. It is for two years or at the utmost three and a half, and you are setting up this big staff. Perhaps we may have enlightenment as to how we are to get rid of them. I do certainly think we are entitled to some explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Home Secretary forgets that the Civil Service staffs are all controlled by the Civil Service Commission! They prescribe examinations. They make almost every grade of appointment, or almost every grade. I know they have tests, because I have informed friends who have written to mo to that effect after having made inquiries. The Civil Service Commission not only examines but distributes appointments, though that may not be with reference to higher servants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Ministry would be under that Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It applies exactly in the same way to this Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then I have no more to say, except I hope the Civil Service Commission will prove equal to their task. If the North Eastern Railway is taken over in a few years, I should like to see the new form of examination paper for porters and various other goods-yard controllers as to their duties. I agree, perhaps, this Amendment cannot be passed; but I do say this is a matter which ought to be at the back of the mind of the Minister and in the background of the Government. Directly the operations of this Department are extended, it will probably extend the facilities enormously for employment in the service of the State. I have had probably a score of applications from demobilised officers, or officers about to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>841</span>
be demobilised, asking me to take up their applications with the Ministry, and actually sending me copies of those applications. I desire to be relieved of these without having to write an answer to the effect that I am not prepared to do anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think there is a misunderstanding about the provision being only for two years. It is not a two-years provision. The Bill itself does not lapse at the end of two years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only Clause 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only Clause 3. I entirely agree with what has been said by my hon. and learned Friend who has just sat down, that if we are going on to very large State-owned and directly State-controlled—using control not in the technical sense, but in the sense of the services such as the whole of the railways of the Kingdom—it would be an intolerable position if every porter were claiming special consideration here in London. Some arrangements for the appointment of the staff would be necessary. But so far as that is concerned, we cannot nationalise railways without a Bill. Clause 4 was dropped for that purpose, so that question does not arise at the present time. When the nationalisation of railways comes before us, I doubt very much whether we could go on without some sort of provision to deal with this particular question. I do not say what provision, but some provision. As regards the actual staff of the Ministry during the present period, or in permanency, if it does not expand to a large State-controlled Department of National Transportation, the rules which apply to the clerical staff of every other Government Department will apply to this, and for the purpose of a clerical staff, and the superior grade Civil servants, I am already in communication with the heads of the Civil Service organisation, so that this Department shall be dealt with exactly on the same lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where it is necessary to obtain professional technical assistance, which is outside the scope of the Civil Service, I have already submitted the names of a certain limited number of gentlemen of technical qualifications, with their qualifications, to the Treasury, and have made proposals to them which are under discussion at the present moment. Then I hope, certainly from the railways, and also from
	<span class='label label-info column'>842</span>
other undertakings, that it will be possible to draw the small number of high technical officers, which will be necessary for the Ministry, on loan, and power is sought in the Bill for that, and there is also provision that they should not break the continuity of their service and lose their pensions. Then another way in which we are seeking an enabling power under the Bill is to transfer clerical staff from portions of the railway undertakings which will have a surplus. The Railway Clearing House, for example, owing to the State control and the lack of need for the meticulous division of accounts is now finding, when its staff is returning from the war, that it has a surplus, and it is hoped usefully, suitably and appropriately to employ that surplus staff by putting them into clerical positions, either on the railways or in the Ministry as far as is necessary. In that way we hope to appoint a staff, but if we ever come to any large nationalised system of transportation I entirely agree that the situation has got to be met. It would be intolerable otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree with what the right hon. Gentleman has said. This question does not arise now. It only arises if nationalisation ever takes place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may arise tomorrow, as under the provisions of the Bill the Ministry is going to take power to establish transport services. It may run a new omnibus or a new tramway service or anything of the kind tomorrow morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is in the new Clauses which have not yet come on. I had forgotten it for the moment. I admit that if those new Clauses are passed in the form in which they stand now something of this sort might arise. That might be a very strong argument for not giving the new Clauses. That is the time, I should think, for discussing that particular point. I think I am right in saying that the Civil Service Commission do not appoint at the present moment all the staff of every Ministry. I think that a Minister can go outside the Civil Service Commission and appoint a staff of his own free will. I fancy that that has already been done at the Ministry of National Service. Therefore, the Committee must not think that the more or less restricted regulations of the Civil Service Commission are always applicable or will be applicable to the first part of the Bill, which is a permanent Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>843</span>
and provides for taking over certain functions already exercised by other Government Departments. But whether or not this particular Amendment would obviate this very great difficulty, which I quite agree with my hon. Friend exists and ought to be met, is very doubtful, because constituents would be equally desirous of going to my hon. Friend and asking him to exercise pressure upon this particular Committee, and I do not think that you are going to get rid of that by taking it out of the power of say the right hon. Gentleman and putting it into the power of say, a Committee consisting of two or three hon. Gentlemen sitting opposite him, reinforced by other hon. Members. The same thing will occur. The only possible way in which you could do it would be by appointing an outside body altogether, something like a judge who is appointed for life and who cannot be removed and whose decisions are irrevocable, but I do not want to discuss this at any length because it is a very serious matter and is one of the reasons why I hope that we shall not nationalise everything as my hon. Friend seems to think may be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am far from satisfied with the reply of the right hon. Gentleman. I maintain that this Bill is of a temporary character. The right hon. Gentleman tells us that he is going probably to borrow men from the Railway Clearing House and from some of the railways and bring them up to London temporarily. It is a very difficult matter to bring men to London and keep them there for a year or two, and then send them back again. They would be very much in the position of the munition workers who were in temporary employment during the War, and who, as soon as they were discharged, said that they were unemployed and demanded unemployment benefit. The right hon. Gentleman might not be at the head of the Department then. He might accept a better position elsewhere. Someone else might be in his place twelve months hence. Therefore we are entitled as a Committee to take all the safeguards possible on an important matter of this description. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will see his way to agree to a Committee such as is adumbrated in the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir FORTESCUE FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the fullest sympathy with the motive of my hon. Friend (Mr. Joynson-Hicks) in
	<span class='label label-info column'>844</span>
moving this Amendment. There is no doubt whatever that any step in the direction of nationalisation will subject every Member of Parliament to pressure for the obtaining of paid appointments. That is one of the evils of the form of corruption which I think will inevitably follow, and any safeguard to protect the public service from such a form of corruption should have the sympathy and support of everyone. But what the right hon. Baronet has just indicated seems to me very largely to modify the idea that one had first, that my hon. and learned Friend's Amendment would have the effect which he desired. All of us who have been in the House of Commons for some years have had a great deal of experience of the competition for appointments say to the Magistracy. When I first had the honour of sitting in this House I was asked from time to time to approach the Lord Lieutenant of the County in favour of Mr. So-and-So. That was the one authority that I was always invited to endeavour to influence. But to-day we have the Advisory Committee, sometimes numbering about twenty, who advise the Lord Lieutenant as to the appointment of magistrates, and when an ambitious person comes to a Member of Parliament he says: "If you do not know the Lord Lieutenant well enough, and if you do not know Mr. So-and-So well enough, here is a list of twenty, and there are some of them whom you do know, and I am sure you can influence some of them to help to get me the appointment." With great respect for my hon. Friend I think that instead of one Minister to be subjected to pressure by Members of Parliament he would substitute ten or a dozen members of an advisory committee, one of whom might be selected as the victim of pressure in order to influence his colleague on that committee. So while I have the fullest sympathy with the object of my hon Friend, I hope that we shall recall the statement—it is almost a pledge—of the right hon. Gentleman that this question shall be dealt with as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave no such pledge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend did say he recognised the necessity for dealing with it and he expressed the hope that it might be dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, at the end of Sub-section (1), to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"and shall be responsible for the acts of his servants and subject to process in His Majesty's courts in the same way as a private person and shall be under the same liability as to costs."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>846</span>
This is a somewhat difficult point too. The Committee probably know that a Government Department—the Crown—at the present time cannot be sued. I am. proposing that the Minister under this Amendment shall be responsible for the acts of his servants and subject to process in His Majesty's Courts in the same way as a private person. Of course the Ministry in this case will, as soon as they establish a single Transport undertaking, be in a very grave position as regards the others of His Majesty's subjects. There will be contractors. Suppose, for instance, that my right hon. Friend runs a transport line of some kind on the road, either an omnibus or a goods lorry, and runs over one of His Majesty's subjects, there must be a. claim against somebody for compensation. If to-day a motor lorry or omnibus or anything else injures either person or property, there is a claim, not against the driver,—that would be absurd; he cannot afford to pay compensation,—but against the owner of the vehicle, who is responsible for the act of the driver, and who, if the driver is negligent, has to pay compensation. When the Government is the owner the answer is that the Government—that is the King—is not responsible. I will tell the Committee a case which is within my own knowledge. It is a claim by a farmer against the War Office in reference to hay. I happen to have the matter in my own office. The amount involved was only about £100. In order to bring the case to an issue before His Majesty's judges we have had to present a petition of right. The petition of right had to go to the Home Secretary. It was considered by him and actually had to go before His Majesty in person, and a few weeks ago I got that document with the words "let right be done" signed by His Majesty's own sign manual, and this had to be done before an action could be taken. If the Government are going to trade on a large scale it would be utterly impossible, wherever injury is done to person or property, that a claimant should have to present a petition of right to the Home Secretary, and that he should have to take it to His Majesty and get His Majesty's sign manual before the case could be brought to an issue. That is the law at present, and I am proposing that the Minister, who will be in the same position as the employer of any driver and so forth, shall be responsible for the acts of his servants in the same
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>847</span>
way as an ordinary owner would be. It does not necessarily follow that he would have to pay in every case, but we must have some such Clause as this to enable all sections of the public to sue the Minister in the same way as they can sue the ordinary proprietor of a tramway, railway, or dock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This, again, is a question which, if it is to be considered at all, ought to be considered with regard to the whole of His Majesty's servants. It is quite a mistake to describe, as is done in the Amendment, as "his servants" the men who are engaged in the Ministry of Ways and Communications. They are not the Minister's servants at all. They are the public's servants, just as the Minister is himself. He happens to be the superior, but they are not his servants. Really, the question is one to be dealt with generally and should refer to the whole of the Civil Service. The number of actions that might be brought against the Ministry of Ways and Communications in running down cases, etc., is childish compared with what might be brought against the War Office, or the Admiralty, or the Post Office. I am not contesting the principle of the liability, and I am not contesting the accusation that to proceed by a petition of right is cumbersome and awkward; but I suggest to the Committee that a question of this kind should not be dealt with by an Amendment to a single Bill, but should be done by a general Act relating to the whole of His Majesty's servants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What happens in the case of a person run over by the driver of a post office van?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NEAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend who moved the Amendment has very much understated the case. A petition of right does not allow at all for negligence. You may have a petition of right in respect of contract, but in case of tort you have no such remedy, on the maxim that the Crown can do no wrong, and unless the Amendment is accepted no workman who is injured in the course of his employment, unless he can bring himself within an exception which I think there is in the Workmen's Compensation Act, and which gives away the whole principle contended for by the Home Secretary to-day, could recover damages. The fact is that the old maxim
	<span class='label label-info column'>848</span>
has been ridden to death, and to suggest that the negligent act of some servant who is described by the Home Secretary as being as much in the service of the Crown as the Minister himself, to say that that is the act of the Crown and that the subject loses his right because of that, is really an anachronism which we ought to abolish at the earliest possible moment. In my own practice I had a case in which, through the grossly negligent act of the driver of a motor car which was at the moment being driven for the purpose of an inspection by some subordinate military officer, a civilian was run down and suffered the gravest personal injuries. I had to advise that civilian that he had no rights whatever, and that all he could do was to plead 	<i>ad misericordiam.</i> The War Office sent an officer to hold an inquiry, at which no one had any rights whatever. The inquiry was conducted more or less arbitrarily, and a sum was ultimately awarded as an act of grace which was totally inadequate—not one fifth of what any British jury would have been pleased to give in such a case—and my client had to be thankful for that sum. I suggest that we are living in days, when that sort of thing will not do, and if this Bill paves the way for most important developments on these lines I think it must be accepted that an old maxim of that description, which was quite properly intended in the first instance for the dignity of the Crown, shall not be used as an instrument of oppression against His Majesty's subjects. See what would happen unless this Amendment is accepted. The right hon. Gentleman might take control of a certain railway, and under his control the railway company still remains liable in damages for tort, either to its own servants or to members of the general public. The right hon. Gentleman from that railway which he controls might establish some branch, and then arises the question whether a person working on that branch who was injured by something which happened on that branch has got any rights. Any lawyer would be bound to tell him that his rights depended entirely whether the action happened on the part of the railway owned by the Company or on the part owned by the Crown. Unless this Amendment is accepted I have not the faintest notion what the meaning of this Clause is. We do not sue His Majesty in a petition of right, and a person seeking,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>849</span>
as my hon. Friend's client was seeking, to recover £100 for his hay does not come as a plaintiff with his Majesty as defendant. He comes into Court as a suppliant. That is the phrase by which he is described in the proceedings, and it is not the issuing of a process against the Crown, it is the lodging of a petition. It is not a sueing at all, except in the perhaps very technical sense that you may be said to sue for consideration by the Crown. I do not understand this Clause at all, unless it is in the minds of the Ministry to give civil rights. If the Bill stands without this Amendment there will at once be some work for the Law Courts to determine whether Parliament has not, by putting in these words, given exactly what my hon. Friend's Amendment suggests should be given, and I respectfully suggest that this is a matter which cannot be deferred, that we cannot be told from time to time that we must wait until the question of general policy is settled by Parliament. This is a Committee of Parliament; it has ample powers to amend this Bill in this direction, and that creates a precedent for other Bills and a movement in the direction of abolishing the anomalies and the anachronisms to which I have called attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is something of a precedent for an Amendment of this sort in the Corn Production Act of last year, which occurs to my memory because of the illustration given by my hon. Friend about his farmer client. I happened to have some dispute myself as a farmer, and I was foolish enough not to employ any lawyer nor even any barrister, and I did not have to go to His Majesty and get a petition of right, but I appeared by himself and got damages to the extent of £195, and beat the Government. Therefore, I venture to say that there is a precedent under that particular Act, which allowed me to appear without all these formalities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was it a contract?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The Government compelled me to plough up some land and I thought it was a bad thing to do. They would not listen to me, and I brought an action against them for damages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an arbitration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but it shows that in that particular Act the Government did admit that there was a necessity for put-
	<span class='label label-info column'>850</span>
ting them in a different position from the ordinary position in which the Government stands with regard to sueing. It is quite correct that as matters stand now the Post Office do not pay any damages except as an act of grace. Therefore, this question does arise. Whether it arises now is another matter. I do not think it does, because it only comes in if railways and other undertakings are nationalised, or if the Clause, of which my hon. Friend reminded me the other day, is passed. But I really think that when this Bill becomes an Act, if further proceedings are taken under it something of this sort will have to be introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Really the only question before us is whether or not an Amendment of this description should be put in by this Committee or whether it ought not to be left to the House of Commons to do it. The words of the Clause, of course, are for the purpose of contracts, and they enable an action to be brought in the County Court without having to get a petition of rights and so on, but it does not affect the question of the liability of the Crown for tort. I will leave it entirely to the Committee. The whole thing is whether we should not do as was done the other day in the Health Bill, where an Amendment of the same kind was brought forward, and it was felt that it should be left to the House of Commons. I should have thought myself that possibly it might be better that the question should be raised on the floor of the House on the Report stage. I have every sympathy with the principle of the thing. I think it is unanswerable that the servants of the Crown ought to be given liability for tort, and the whole question is whether it should be done now or on the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the right hon. Gentleman has said, would it not be a very good thing for this Committee to set the precedent and take it downstairs to the House of Commons, and let them reject it if they think fit. This Ministry is going to be more or less a trading Ministry, but unless the Amendment is accepted it will put the trader in a very difficult position. At present, if a trader has a claim against a company, he has great difficulty in obtaining satisfaction, but if you have got to obtain a claim from the Government, and you say that the Crown cannot be sued, you will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>851</span>
patting the traders of this country in a very difficult position indeed. As regards the individual, some of us have had experience of getting any money at all from the War Office or other Government Departments during the War, where, if we had been dealing with a private person, we should have had a very good claim. I had a case in my own Constituency which is somewhat similar to what the hon. Member for Sheffield (Mr. Neal) told the Committee just now, and that was where a man in charge of an Air Force lorry went home to see his people after he had completed his job. When he started the lorry again, something went wrong with the engine; the thing went on the pavement. One woman was killed, and two women seriously injured, one woman losing her leg. The case was brought to me, and I took it up, and I was informed that an action did not lie against the Crown. Then I submitted it to the Air Board, and they repudiated all liability, and when I appealed to them simply 	<i>ad misericordiam</i> to give us the money merely for one woman in employment to get an artificial leg, they turned me down on that. Therefore, I appeal to my Labour Friends on this Committee that, unless words are put in, the public, the worker and the trader will be in a very bad position, if the Government, or this new Department, cannot be treated in the same way as an ordinary commercial undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHN JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very pleased that hon. Members on the other side have raised this matter, and, although there may be technical difficulties in the way, I think the Committee should take its courage in both hands, and place the responsibility for the rejection of this principle upon the House of Commons itself. We as trade unionists have had very bitter experience, particularly during the last four and a-half years, of the difficulty in which our members find themselves when they meet with accidents in Government Departments. My union has got no less than five cases in one factory owned by the Government. Our members have been absolutely barred from receiving compensation, and the experience of our own organisation is the common experience of practically every union that has anything to do with this kind of employment. Whilst the principle of petitions may have been very good in the days when England was an agricultural country, and accidents were
	<span class='label label-info column'>852</span>
not so common, the situation does not very well fit in with a great industrial country like England to-day, with all the great changes, such as speeding-up and so forth, by which accidents tend to increase. We hope the Committee will agree to carry the principle of this Amendment, and send it downstairs, and then, possibly, the Commons may get the law placed in such a way that everyone may be treated alike, and be able to obtain the same redress from the State as from any private individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sole question before the Committee at the moment appears, not to be the merits of making such a change, but whether that change should be initiated by a Resolution of this Committee, to be considered or confirmed by the House, or whether the House should be left, possibly upon the initiation of the Government, to make such a change. We are all agreed that the old system, which was described so clearly by my hon. Friend opposite, must be changed. The sole question is whether we shall do it by a Resolution here, or leave the matter open until it gets downstairs. Speaking for myself, I think that it would be wiser for this Committee to give effect to what is the universal opinion, as I believe, throughout the Committee, and that either in the exact form of the Amendment, or in some modified form, it would be wise to pass such a Resolution. I think my hon. Friend will agree that his wording does require to be changed. For instance, he speaks of "his servants." We know now that the employes and officials of the new Ministry will not be the servants of the Ministry; they will be the servants of the Crown. There are, perhaps, other verbal modifications that may be necessary, and I am sure no one is more competent than my hon. Friend himself to make such changes in the words as will meet the whole situation. I hope he will be able to do so, and I hope if he does, and moves his Resolution with such modifications as are necessary, my right hon. Friend will be willing—in fact, he has already expressed himself willing—to support the Committee in passing a Resolution, and we shall be morally certain that the House will confirm it. [HON.

I want to know what is meant by "other public Department." The Sub-section says

Then, towards the end of the Subsection, it says
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purposes of this Act the Light Railway Commissioners and the Road Board and the Lord Lieutenant and Privy Council of Ireland shall be deemed to be Government Departments."</p></blockquote>
If those are defined as Government Departments, what other Departments is he going to take over other than these Government Departments?

Two examples of what are considered public departments are the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, known as the Irish Board of Works, and the Congested Districts Board.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, at the end of Sub-section (2) to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the expression 'tramway' includes a trackless trolley vehicle system, and the expression 'undertaking' includes any services carried on as ancillary to the principal business of the undertaking."</p></blockquote>
The object of this Amendment will, I think, be apparent. A trackless trolley vehicle is one between a tramway and an omnibus. It was excluded in order to bring it in here. The other portion of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>857</span>
Amendment is to make it permissible, in taking over an undertaking, to take over its ancillary services, such as cartage, hotel services, and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, after the words last inserted, to add the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the expression 'transport services by water' shall not include any transport service by sea other than such as is, or could under their existing statutory powers, or any extension thereof, be, established by the owners of any undertaking of which the Minister is for the time being in possession under this Act."</p></blockquote>
The object of this Amendment is to make it clear as to the extent to which it is proposed to bring services by water within the purview of the Ministry. The undertakings of which possession can be taken under the Bill have powers to run sea services. It is not proposed to extend those powers in any way; but the Minister may have the same power in such undertakings as he takes over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dare say, like a great many people interested in shipping, we have all had a good many letters in connection with this matter. I want to be short, concise, and explicit. It is understood by this that the Minister of Ways and Communications should not, in any circumstances, interfere with what is recognised and known as the coastwise trade of this country. If the Government will say that I am quite right in interpreting this Amendment in the way I have suggested, so far as I am concerned, I should be perfectly satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee does not quite recognise what enormous powers we are going to give the Ministry under this new Section. It says
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not include any transport service by sea other than such is or could be under their existing Statutory powers. …"</p></blockquote>
and so on. The railway companies at present can practically do anything they like in regard to ships. The right hon. Gentleman was connected with the North Eastern Railway Company. May I remind him that the North Eastern Railway Company were in agreement with two shipping lines, the Wilson and the Ellerman Line, before the War, and I have no doubt they are ready to take it up again, and run a line not only across the Channel, but to Danish, Swedish, and other ports. The Committee, I think, does not recognise the enormous number of steamers owned or
	<span class='label label-info column'>858</span>
chartered by the railway companies with their present powers. What shipowners would like, I am quite certain, would be to curtail in this respect the activities of the railway companies. Take the case of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. Before the War they had the largest fleet of steamers of the lot. They not only ran their steamers in connection with the railways, but across the channel. The North Eastern, the Great Central, the London and North Western, the South Eastern and Chatham, and the Midland Railway Companies all had enormous fleets of steamers, not only of their own, but chartered. Surely we are not going to hand them over to this new Ministry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>An HON. MEMBER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because I think it would not be for the good of the country in that it would stifle competition. There is no power on earth that can make the railway companies divulge whether or not, and what money, they are making out of their ships. We can never find that out. I hope the Committee will consider before giving over this enormous power to the new Ministry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> rose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think if the hon. Member is going to put forward the argument that this is giving greater powers that I can hear him. That really is not the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do think we are entitled to a reply from the Minister. The Government urges the Committee to be as brief as possible and we are trying to be so; but if we cannot get a reply we must take other steps. What I put was a perfectly courteous question. No one realises more, I think, than does the right hon. Gentleman, with his knowledge of mercantile affairs, how far-reaching this Clause may be. If, for instance, we understand, and it is given here plainly, that it is not intended to interfere in any shape or form with even our coastwise steamers, let alone others, well and good. For instance, if he can give us that undertaking we should know exactly where we are. It will facilitate matters. We realise and understand the case of the ordinary railway communications, what I call the cross-Channel service. We have gone into it in the earlier stages. But we want it to be clearly established that the railway
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>859</span>
companies are not to be in a position to increase their fleets so as to encompass the coastwise trade of the country. We want an explicit reply. If we get a reply in the affirmative then I should not press it further. If not, I shall have to go further into the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no extension of powers in this at all. Parliament has from time to time given the railway companies—and, so far as I know, has given the dock companies—though I am not so familiar with them—and the transportation undertakings power to run steamers to certain ports. I think in every case the ports are mentioned, or in most cases. [An HON. MEMBER: "No, no."] Well, the specific ports with which I am familiar. There is no intention to go beyond these existing powers. If this Committee were to take action to limit the powers of the Minister in this respect you do not interfere with the powers of the railways at all. These are contained in their Acts. You would have, if need be, specifically to annul all those provisions. This is a limiting provision put in after consultation with the Ministry of Shipping. As regards the coastal service, so far as I know, no railway has any powers to run what is strictly a coastal service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>An HON. MEMBER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, between England and Ireland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that. There are certain services between England and Ireland which are not physically coastal services. There are services across the North Sea, and the Irish Channel too. Wherever these powers exist they are simply carried forward. The Minister is given a purview over the activities of particular undertakings exactly as the undertakings have rights to-day. Statutory rights are not increased or decreased. I should like to correct my hon. Friend (Mr. Renwick) on a question of fact. The North Eastern Railway Company have no powers, so far as I know, and they have never run over to Denmark or to the Baltic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rose a while ago in the hope of shortening the discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You cannot shorten it much, as there are only three minutes left.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>860</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope, as the Minister-designate has already said, that he only intends this to apply to past existing statutory powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what the Clause says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause says "or any extension thereof." If the right hon. Gentleman agrees that that should come out I have no more to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move to leave out Sub-section (3).

The Government having dropped Clause 4, this ought to come in connection with it. I hope the Minister in charge will accept it. I should like an answer from the right hon. Gentleman as to this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>Clause, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Committee do now adjourn until Tuesday next at 11 a.m."</p></blockquote>
I have given my reasons for this. I think the interval will probably be very useful to us all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before you put that, Mr. Brace, I had hoped that we might have had some indication from the Minister as to this advisory Clause. We are going to meet tomorrow to discuss these new Clauses. I have no conception myself from the Clause the Minister has put down in regard to the Advisory Committee what really he means to do, what size the Committee is to be, when it is to be called, or anything about it. It is a most visionary Clause, made I imagine—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member will allow me, the question, as I understand it, is "That the Committee do now adjourn until Tuesday next at 11 a.m." I have no authority for saying so, but I am sure the Members of the Committee will not think I am assuming a power I do not possess when I suggest that if any Member desires to get into touch with the Minister upon any point of doubt of the proposed Clause the Ministry, I am certain, will be very ready to make arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the object of the adjournment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>861</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would say this further: "We are going to adjourn till Tuesday. Surely that is conditional. The new Clauses promised should be in our hands before that? There is a Compensation Clause promised. We have not seen it. Will we have it this week? We might—I mean our private Committee—sit, for instance, on Monday; and it is no use adjourning now and then asking for another adjournment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As Chairman I cannot help you in that direction. I should have power, at any rate, to take a Motion to report Progress or to move the Adjournment. I think the hon. Member had better wait now until Tuesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before you put the Question I would like to emphasise the remarks
	<span class='label label-info column'>862</span>
that have fallen from my hon. Friend who has just spoken. I am sure that the Government will recognise that these compensation Clauses are of the utmost importance. If they can see their way to let us have them a day or two before the meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the Minister recognises the importance of our request, and that is all I wish to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is with the object of trying to facilitate matters that we have agreed to the adjournment. We will do everything we can to help the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
