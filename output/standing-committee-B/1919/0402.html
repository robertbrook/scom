	<div class='title'>—(Appointment of Minister of Ways and Communications.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>For the purpose of improving the means of, and the facilities for, locomotion and transport, it shall be lawful for His Majesty to appoint a Minister of Ways and Communications (hereinafter referred to as the Minister), who shall hold office during His Majesty's pleasure.</p>
	<p>Amendment proposed [	<i>1st April</i>], to leave out the words,
	<br><q><p>"It shall be lawful for His Majesty to appoint a Minister of Ways and Communications (hereinafter referred to as the Minister), who shall hold office during His Majesty's pleasure,"</p></q>
and to insert instead thereof the words
	<br><q><p>"(1) there shall be established a Board of Ways and Communications charged with the superintendence of matters relating to transport in the United Kingdom;
	<ol>
	<li>the Board shall consist of a president and six other members, who shall be appointed with reference to their special knowledge of the matters included in the Bill;</li>
	<li>the president and members of the Board shall be appointed by His Majesty and shall hold office during His Majesty's pleasure;</li>
	<li>the Board shall be deemed to be established on the appointment of the president thereof."—[	<i>Mr. Joynson-Hicks</i>.]</li>
</ol></p></q></p>
	<p>Question again proposed,
	<br><q><p>"That the words proposed to be left out. down to the word 'Ways', stand part of the Clause."</p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel ARTHUR MURRAY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we to have a statement from the Minister in charge of the Bill in regard to this matter? I think that was understood yesterday when the Debate concluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The SECRETARY of STATE for the HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. Shortt)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood that another member of the Committee wished to speak first. That is why no Minister rose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. REN WICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this the Clause we were dealing with yesterday or the one on the Paper to-day, because I have an Amendment dealing with the question of consultative councils which I wish to move?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>344</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. BARTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want to hear something from the Minister in charge of the Bill, because many of our opinions are in a state of flux.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members wish to. express their views, but when the Committee rose yesterday the right hon. Gentleman was in possession of the floor to make a statement on this Clause, and the impression was that he would make a statement at the opening of the proceedings to-day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir WILLIAM PEARCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an Amendment on the new Clause which provides the Minister with the consultative machinery, so to speak. I do not know whether the Minister has observed that, but it has been put down by a body representing an important interest. It does not make it so absolutely a part of the machinery of the Department, but it does make a valuable suggestion, and when the right hon. Gentleman deals with this Clause I think it would be an advantage to the Committee if he bore in mind that proposal and further on the new Clause and give us the opinion of the Government on both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be out of order for the right hon. Gentleman to discuss that part of the Bill on the particular Amendment before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The MINISTER (Designate) of WAYS and COMMUNICATIONS (Sir Eric Geddes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment and others which follow it tend towards setting up a board of some kind, or several boards. The Amendment provides, so far as one may judge from it, for a board which should share with the Minister the responsibility for whatever action is taken under the powers given by this Bill. A board of that kind must either be a board upon which the Minister sits as the superior authority or upon which the Minister sits as an equal, or it must be a board which sits above the Minister. If a board of that kind sits above the Minister it appears to me that we destroy at once the responsibility of the Minister to Parliament and the Crown and we get an absolutely impossible state of affairs. We do not know who is responsible. On the other hand if it is a board which is subordinate to the Minister you have this position that the Minister must have the right to say what is to go to that Board; it will be impossible to lay it down in the Bill. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>345</span>
Minister, if the board is subordinate to him, would have the power, subject to the Crown, of appointment to, and dismissal from, the board. That is the position in the board of Admiralty to-day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the board is not to be articulate I think—and I speak with some authority of the Board of Admiralty and some other boards—it serves no more useful purpose than the Minister consulting the various heads of Departments. At the Admiralty, which was cited by one of the members of the Committee as an example, the First Lord has the right, under the Crown, of appointment to, and removal from, the board. He has the right to settle what items shall appear upon the agenda of the Board and he has the right to distribute among the members of the board such duties as he thinks fit. Those are the prerogatives of the First Lord, and if you eliminate the naval element—and the naval element or anything comparable to it will be absent from this Ministry—it really gives you under this Amendment a conference with heads of Department. Such a conference I should think any reasonable man at the head of the Ministry such as this would always hold. If you constitute a board of that kind, where you have not the necessity for laying down a naval authority as you have in the Board of Admiralty, it does not seem to me to serve any more useful purpose than is served than by consulting your heads of Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If you set up the third type of board alongside the Minister to watch him, and you allow the board to be articulate, and either under this Amendment or any other Amendment to watch him with a separate spokesman, either in the House of Commons or the House of Lords, again you arrive at a most unconstitutional position. Therefore, it seems to me that you are driven back to a board which is subordinate to the Minister which can be appointed by the Minister, which can be removed by the Minister; this Minister can say who shall be the members of it, and he can say what is to go on the agenda of the board; for there must be some authority to say what is to go on the agenda, and you cannot lay it down in the Act, so that you must have consultation with the heads of Department, senior officials or otherwise. What kind of board can we look to? The Board of Trade is not a very good example. I think it was said that the Archbishop of Canterbury is one of the most distinguished members of that Board
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>346</span>
I do not think that Board ever meets, but the President of the Board of Trade does consult the permanent officials regularly. The Board of Admiralty exists so that there may be an authority to give an order to the Fleet. That is really what the Lord High Admiral does in commission. Through members of the Board and the secretary he can give a legal order to the Fleet. Apart from that, the Lords of the Admiralty are the heads of the various Departments. They meet as and when the First Lord summons a meeting, and they deliberate upon such things as he puts upon the agenda. The responsibility for anything but a direct order to the Fleet must be the direct responsibility of the Government. That is what you get by having a consultative meeting every morning or every third morning with the heads of Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When you consider this proposal to have a board under the Minister of Ways and Communications you are driven back to the conclusion that you must have a responsible Minister who must be responsible to Parliament as a member of the Cabinet, and you must have the direct responsibility of the Minister which must be shared by no one else. And, indeed, I think that the House and the country would wish that there should be someone who would be responsible, and that the intention of the Committee is that there should be some sort of guarantee that the Minister, whoever he is—and I will say at once that we are not looking at personalities in this at all—should have somebody to whom he could go and talk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will tell the Committee, if I may, exactly how I view that suggestion. I confess, indeed, it is on the face of the Bill, that I have not yet made up my mind, and I do not think that anyone on the Committee can have made up his mind, as to exactly how this very tangled skein of transportation is to be organised in future. It may be desirable to link the organisation of canals with docks, or to keep roads and light railways together. I do not know. It may be desirable in some sort of area commissions, local commissions, which is what I have in mind, to bring the railways and docks up to the quay edge under one commission authority—I do not mean to manage them, but I mean for general control. I do not say that that is the right thing, I merely say that that is one of the things which one might consider, and leave the water areas
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>347</span>
separate. Therefore I am very reluctant at this stage to commit myself or my successor to any regular system of boards. At the same time I would like to assure the Committee that it is my intention to consult throughout these two years—I would ask the Committee to recollect that these two years stand by themselves, and that are a temporary period—accredited representatives of the big interests so vitally affected by this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARSHALL STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will you consult each interest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the big interests. If I may elaborate a little I will take first, I will not say it is the most important, but it is a very important one—Labour. I have regular access there through the transport union. If I wish to consult the railways I have the railways companies' association. If I wish to consult as to the roads, I would welcome a self-appointed committee, a small committee which I could consult on road matters. Similarly with regard to docks; if there were a small committee to which one could get readily I would welcome that. If some such consultative board is appointed by the great interest, to whom I could go in difficulties, and ask them to help to solve them, I would welcome that, but during the two years—after that I hope that we shall have something very statutory on these points—or for such periods as will elapse before we get our scheme cut and dry, I hope that the Committee will not press for statutory bodies. If what I have described will meet the wishes of Members it would meet my wishes. That is what I intend. I would Welcome it going into the Bill, that the Minister undertakes to consult the various interests during the two years before taking any action. Let them appoint their own bodies—the large interests, not every little sectional interest—and it can be put into the Bill, that it is understood that the Minister will consult them during the two years, and that he may invite—I think that there is precedent for something of the kind—these bodies to appoint committees to meet him. Further than that I think it would be hampering to go. I would ask the Committee to realise that this is only a two years' Bill from this point of view. It has got to be put on a much more permanent basis after the two years, and I would ask the Committee not at the moment to tie my hands with statutory
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>348</span>
bodies, which might not really represent the sections of transportation as they will eventually be divided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard from the right hon. Gentleman with a certain amount of surprise that he has not made up his mind as to what he is going to do in the next few years. He seems to be groping about in various directions as to how he is going to deal with railways, roads and canals, and whether he is going to do it separately or together. If ever there was an argument in favour of a consultative council we have it here. The right hon. Gentleman pleads for everything to be left to him for two years. Two years is not a very long period in the life of a nation, but a lot of mischief can be done in two years. A fox may be in a hen roost for only two or three minutes, but he may do a lot of mischief in that time. I do not for a moment presume to say that the right hon. Gentleman is a fox, yet I recognise that in two years a great deal of mischief can be done which it will take a great many years to repair. It is because I recognise the utility of the right hon. Gentleman that I am most anxious to have a consultative committee of some description to advise him. We all remember that Napoleon was an extremely clever man. It took the whole of Europe twenty years to overtake him and prevent him carrying out certain schemes which he had in mind. I know that the right hon. Gentleman is full of zeal, and that he is going to do his very best to improve the means of transport. The very same plea which I put forward here was put before the House of Commons yesterday in regard to finance. The Leader of the House pointed out that this was a war measure, that it was only in war conditions that such a measure could be justified, but he recognised that there should be some curb put upon the activities of the right hon. Gentleman with regard to finance, and he said that what was contemplated by the Resolution was to get a Treasury representative to deal with the questions, a man of real capacity who would be put into the Department to watch the finance and advise the Chancellor, and that the Government would take care that the Treasury control was real. If it is necessary to control the expenditure on the schemes of the right hon. Gentleman, surely it is necessary that we should have some consultative board of competent gentlemen to advise him in regard to the schemes which he has in hand. I am not

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>349</span>
sure that it is competent for me now to call attention to my Amendment, which is at the bottom of the first page, but, as this is a general discussion, perhaps I should be in order in calling attention to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It all depends on whether the hon. Gentleman is prepared to make his speech on his Amendment now. If not, I think it better that he should wait until he comes to his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir RYLAND ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. May I submit that the very important speech of the Minister designate has raised of necessity the whole question of what machinery shall be put into the Bill to express the relations between the Minister and these great interests. I think that if you thought it fit to allow my hon. Friend and others to discuss the alternatives now the matter would, I imagine, come up finally on some Clause drafted by the Minister to carry out what was said, but I think that it would be of assistance to the Committee if we might have a regular outline of the alternative suggestion applicable to the very important speech which we have heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I am in the hands of the Committee, but my function is to make progress, and I am a little timid of some of the Members if I allow a long discussion to take place upon this particular Amendment, and then I have to rule out of order the actual Amendment when it comes before the Committee. If there is an honourable undertaking by Members that we shall make progress, and that when we reach particular Amendments we shall take them without discussion, I should be very ready to fall in with it, but I must not be taken as agreeing to a general discussion now and also to a debate later on. If there is a discussion now the Amendment when it comes up should be taken to a Division largely without discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMAS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not it meet the convenience of the Committee that we should settle on this Amendment the scheme of a committee of each service; let that be dealt with one way or the other and all Amendments dealing with that principle can be ruled out. It would be unfair if we were going to have a general discussion on one particular Amendment, and then have a similar discussion on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>350</span>
every other Amendment. There would be no progress whatever made. If the Committee determine on this Amendment the principle on which it desires to act, then I think it could be understood that the other Amendments may be ruled out. That would save time and be for the convenience of the committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It really seems to me that on this point the difficulty is that we have not got the proposals of the Ministry before us. We have heard the right hon. Gentleman's speech, but until his actual proposals are put down either in the form of an Amendment or a new Clause, it is quite impossible we should agree that the subsequent Amendments should not be debated. In the ordinary way we should ask to report Progress in order that the very important proposal of the Minister should be put down in the form of a new Clause or Amendment. It is impossible to give the undertaking asked for until we have seen the actual proposals of the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite understand. I fully appreciate that hon. Members would feel reluctant to take their Amendments off the Order Paper, but if we have a long discussion on the Amendment now before the Committee upon which questions may be raised dealing with other Amendments on the Order Paper, I should think it could very well be agreed to take these other Amendments without any discussion, merely dividing upon them. Unless I can have a thorough understanding with the Committee that that course shall be adopted I am afraid I must confine the present discussion to the actual Amendment before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. LOWE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be a very good thing if the right hon. Gentleman in charge of the Bill would say at what point he proposes to set up and have embodied in the Bill an Advisory Committee composed of the various interests which he desires to consult. If he will tell us in what portion of the Bill he proposes to insert such a Clause I think we might very well pass over this Amendment and wait until we come to the Clause which it is intended to insert. That would certainly save time and enable us to get on with the business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the most convenient place in which to insert the proposal would be at the end of Clause 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>351</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would make it exceedingly difficult for some of us to refrain from dealing with our Amendments which come before Clause 3. If the Minister can see his way to draft his Clause and let us have it immediately after Clause 1 has been dealt with, then I am sure it would help us to proceed more rapidly with the work of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do we want to discuss this point of order any further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieutenant-Colonel Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The most important factors of the Bill are, in fact, in Clause 3, and if we are to be shut out from a general discussion until we come to the end of that Clause there are many important points which deal primarily with the manner in which the Government is going to act, which it will be impracticable for us to discuss at that point: therefore I venture to suggest that the new Clause—or addition to a Clause—should come in at the end of Clause 1, and it should be brought forward by the Government at the present time. I do not think it will take very long to draft the Clause, and the adoption of this suggestion would undoubtedly tend to shorten discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Newcastle (Mr. Renwick) will now confine himself to the Amendment before the Committee, when we come to his own Amendment on the Order Paper it will raise the whole of these questions. I think we had better try to make progress with the question we have before the Committee, and I must therefore ask hon. Members to confine their remarks to that Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may be allowed to raise the question of my Amendment which comes up later on when we reach it then I shall be quite willing to defer my remarks till that occasion arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of your ruling that we can on the Amendment of the hon. Member for Newcastle raise the whole question of a consultative committee or committees, and their statutory or nonstatutory position, I would ask the hon. Member (Mr. Joynson-Hicks) whether under these circumstances he will not be willing to withdraw his Amendment on the understanding that the whole question will be debated at a later stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>352</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that is a very reasonable suggestion on the part of my hon. and learned Friend. I do not want to worry Ministers. I want to get something good into the Bill, and if my right hon. Friend can only get his Amendment drafted and put on the Paper before we reach the Amendment of the hon. Member for Newcastle, then I think it will be possible to take the discussion at that later stage. It does not matter where the Ministerial Amendment comes in the Bill so long as we can know the terms of it before we reach the Amendment of the hon. Member for Newcastle. If this were a party fight we should, of course, at once move to report Progress, because the Minister has made a very important statement with regard to a proposed alteration in the terms of the Bill, and I have no doubt the Committee, under such circumstances, would agree to report Progress until the terms of the Amendment were before us. But I do not want to do that. I do not want to harass the Government. I am quite willing to withdraw this Amendment on the understanding that the whole question will be raised later on on the Motion of the hon. Member for Newcastle and that the Government will put their proposal down on the Paper before that Amendment is reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one point I should like to mention. I want to discuss this before the Minister puts his Amendment down, as then he will see what is in our minds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite willing to withdraw my Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is understood that if you withdraw your Amendment you will not move that lower down in the name of the hon. Members for Central Cardiff (Mr. Gould) and Coventry (Mr. Manville) and yourself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nor that in the name of the hon. Member for Carlisle (Mr. Carr) and East Renfrew (Mr. J. Johnstone) and yourself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir WILLIAM PEARCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move to leave out the words "Ways and Communications," and to insert instead
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>353</span>
thereof the word "Transport." I promise to take very little time in moving this. A good many of us have begun to call this Committee the Transport Committee already. I do feel that "Ways and Communications" is a very long and cumbersome title, and my idea in proposing this is not to reduce in any way the powers of the Minister-designate, but merely to shorten the title from twenty-one letters to nine. On that ground I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty in accepting this Amendment is that while I admit it is easier to trip it off the tongue, it is not quite clear that it covers what the Bill intends. "Ways and Communications" may be more difficult to say, but it is much more expressive and certainly a more inclusive term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir HERBERT NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In case of sobriety?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister-designate very much prefers the other title, which was chosen after very careful consideration. It is a matter of some importance that the title should be inclusive of all the powers and duties which are imposed upon the Minister. For that reason the Minister-designate infinitely prefers the title that he himself chose, namely, "Ways and Communications." It is not a matter of serious importance. On the one hand it is only a question of saving a little penmanship and a few syllables when speaking; on the other hand, there are all kinds of things which might be held in after days not to be included in the term "Transport," but which would be included in the term "Ways and Communications." I therefore hope the Committee will not press this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put this to the right hon. Gentleman: that so far as regards a matter to be found out in future days, this is a Bill for two years and at the end of that time there must be another Bill. My second point is, can the Home Secretary or the Minister-designate tell us whether there is anything in this Bill which they are advised would not be included by the word "Transport." The third reason is that the word "Transport" directs public attention to what is the true reason of the Bill, namely, for co-ordinating transport. If you call it "Ways and Communications," it is far more likely to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>354</span>
suggest an upheaval of the methods of maintaining roads and other things, whereas we know from what right hon. Gentlemen say that it is really directed to the problem of transport? I would ask this question in view of the fact that it is only a two years' Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the Ministry is not for two years.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Major Sir H. NORMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would point out to the Home Secretary that the word "Communications," has almost always been understood to refer especially to Posts and Telegraphs. There exists at the present moment an important body called the "Imperial Communications Committee," which has a very wide scope and a very important agenda, and there is in all its scope and agenda not one single thing which is touched by the contents of this Bill. I would, therefore, strongly appeal to the Committee to consider favourably the suggestion of my hon. Friend that the title should be "Transport."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems pretty clear that the Committee does want some easier, and perhaps some more respectable title.

	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, at the end, to add the words
	<br><q><p>"and there shall be established an advisory and consultative council for giving advice and assistance to the Minister on matters relating to locomotion and transport in the United Kingdom.
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>(2)The Minister shall be President of the Council, which shall consist of six other members, of whom one shall be appointed with experience of railway management, two with experience of ports, docks, and piers, one with experience of the construction and management of roads, one with experience of the management and working of canals, and one representing manufactures and commerce.</li>
	<li>(3)The members of the Council shall be appointed by His Majesty on the recommendation of the Prime Minister and shall hold office during His Majesty's pleasure."</li>
</div> <!-- ul --></p></q>
I hope this Amendment will be approved of by the Committee. We are all agreed that we do not want a council that will override the right hon. Gentleman, but we do want a committee which he can consult and which will advise him. I think my Amendment meets that very fairly. I should like to explain here why I ask for two members with experience of ports and docks. It is because there are two descriptions of docks: first, the docks belonging to the railways, and, secondly, docks belonging to harbour and port authorities. While a man might be well versed in the working of railway docks, he possibly knows very little about the other docks. I ask for this committee also because we have had two recent cases where such a committee has been set up. The most recent was the Health Committee,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>356</span>
which we considered in Grand Committee, of which I was a member. That was a committee to advise the Minister of Health. Then we recently had set up a Ministry of Shipping. The Minister of Shipping set up a committee drawn from the shipowners in different parts of the country. That committee was housed in the buildings set apart for the Ministry of Shipping, and it was called in to advise the Minister of Shipping on all matters relating to the management and the working of the ships. I would like to call the attention of the Committee to a letter sent by the Minister of Shipping to the Chamber of Shipping in which he said:
	<br><q><p>"The State had power to take over your ships at reasonable rates of hire, but from the day upon which I assumed my duties as Shipping Controller I realised that without your help, without your skill and energy, the State was powerless to run those ships to the best advantage of the Nation and its Allies. I appealed to you for your help, and you gave it…. Without your ships, without your skill and knowledge, and without your hard and anxious work, the nation could never have been fed and the armies of the United States could never have been placed in the field at the right time and in the right place."</p></q>
There you have two recent precedents. With deference to my hon. Friend, who is somewhat impatient that we are occupying time in discussing the matter, I do not think there is a single hon. Member here, and I question if there is one in the House, who put this matter before his constituents at the time of his election. I do not think there is one of us who discussed it. It was never mentioned. It is something new. It is something sprung upon us. Therefore we are justified in asking for time to give this matter consideration. It is a matter that is affecting great interests: with railways, with roads, with canals, with electric works, and with harbours and ports and docks throughout the Kingdom. Further, I do not think the" right hon. Gentleman himself has recognised yet what enormous interests he is dealing with, and we are justified in asking for time to deal with these important matters. The right hon. Gentleman seems to lay the greatest stress upon railways and what has happened in regard to railways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure that the hon. Member is in order. The Amendment before the Committee is the question of setting up a consultative committee. I hope he will confine himself to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>357</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. REN WICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to show reasons why I think it is necessary to set up this committee, and I cannot do better than call attention to what the right hon. Gentleman has said about railways. I know that is the matter that concerns him most. And the reason he puts forward continually why he wants this Board is that the railways are in a state of chaos. But why are they in a state of chaos? Locomotives, carriages, wagons, and part of the permanent way have been sent over to France. No wonder we are in a state of chaos. But there is no such chaos in regard to harbours. No committee has ever been set up to deal with the question of harbours and docks. No committee has ever reported that they are not in an efficient condition. They are in an efficient condition, and they can deal with two or three times the traffic they have to deal with at present. I am quite willing to leave matters very largely to the right hon. Gentleman. We recognise that he is a valuable asset to the State. He is worth a lot of money in many respects, but he may not be here in a year or two years. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman (Mr. Thomas) may be put in his position before very long. We have not such experience in these matters of railways as the right hon. Gentleman, but we have to recognise that we shall not always have him at the head of this Department and we want to look forward and consider what is going to happen. I am not prepared, and I think the Committee is not prepared, to leave everything to him, however clever he may be. We want someone to advise him, with whom he can consult. When he is going to deal with railways he wants to consult a railway expert, when he is going to deal with roads he wants to call in someone who has experience and is competent to deal with roads. When he is going to deal with docks and harbours he wants to call in some of those gentlemen who have built our harbours and docks and waterways and brought them to the condition they are in to-day. Surely the right hon. Gentleman is not the only man with experience in these matters. There must be other men of great experience. Take the Chairman. I see an hon. Member opposite who told us the other day he had been 29 years a member of the Clyde Harbour Trust. Surely he has some experience which may be of value to the right hon. Gentleman. This is a Bill that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>358</span>
has been brought forward as the result of the experience gained by the right hon. Gentleman in war conditions. In the House of Commons last night that was the only justification for it. Under no ordinary circumstances would such a Bill be brought in. What is going to happen in two years we do not know, but we want the right hon. Gentleman to agree—I hope he will agree, he must see that it is reasonable—that a committee of this sort should be set up. He pleads that he should be the head of it. Of course he should. My Amendment says he is to be the president of it. But we want an advisory committee and if it is necessary to set up a competent official of the Treasury with real control over finance, it is necessary that we should set up a committee of this description with whom the right hon. Gentleman can consult. I want to hear from the right hon. Gentleman whether he agrees to this committee or what other committee he proposes to set up in its place, but we ought to have a committee of some description to advise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMAS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether my hon. Friend's objection is primarily against the Minister or the possibility of myself being appointed, but he need have no apprehension on that particular score. I think a great mistake is made in dealing with the personality of the right hon. Gentleman. I do not believe he is a superman and I have told him so. I think he is quite a good fellow for this job, but all this talk of super-men is beside the question. This is establishing a Ministry, and we ought to keep clearly in mind that it is in future to be a part of the government of the country. The experience of railway managers, port authorities and other people may be all that is said, but it would be an insult to the House of Commons at this day to say that 1,500,000 organised workers who would be affected by this Bill are not even worthy of consultation on the committee that is set up. That may be the view of my hon. Friend, but there are different views held on that matter in the country; and therefore if any Committee is set up and it is suggested that Labour involved to the extent of 1,500,000 is not worthy of a seat on it, Labour will show pretty definitely that its views on consultation by one nominee are more drastic than is in the mind of my hon. Friend. Let there be no mistake about that. In the second place, he objects to the Minister not making up his mind. I hope the Minister will not make up his mind. What

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>359</span>
right have we to assume that we are going to set up this Department with a Minister in charge of it, who comes here and says "I have a cut and dried scheme." Let me give one illustration. If the Minister said "I am in favour of electrifying the railway system," there will be very great difference of opinion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has said so on the Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMAS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has not said anything of the kind. He has said certain portions may be electrified, but it is an entirely different thing to have an electrified area of passenger traffic from having a great scheme of electrification over the whole of the trunk lines in the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the right hon. Gentleman does not wish to misinterpret anything. On the Second Reading, dealing with the whole question of electrification, the right hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><q><p>"It is estimated conservatively that when we get through the electrification of the main line, which should be done, and done promptly, and it will be undertaken if this Bill becomes law."—(OFFICIAL REPORT, 17tih March, 1919, col. 1774, Vol. 113.)</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMAS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the statement in the Second Reading speech. I said something about it at the time. Before that can be done the Minister must of necessity come to the House. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] I say he must of necessity come to the House because that will involve great expenditure of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMAS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one knows how much, but if it involves more than £1,000,000 he must come to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not the way the Bill was drawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMAS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not talking of the way the Bill was drawn. I am talking of the facts of the situation. Yesterday the Chancellor of the Exchequer distinctly said that any expenditure of more than a million had to be sanctioned by Parliament. I do not want the Minister to commit himself at this stage to any scheme of electrification or anything else. What I am putting to the Committee is that Parliament must ultimately determine that. I come back to the question of the consultative committee. Is it to be a committee such as is outlined
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>360</span>
by the Minister, or is it to be seven Ministers? If you are going to appoint a committee who are to control the situation, then we as a Parliament lose absolute control. I am not for setting up any committee that takes away in the least the power and responsibility of a Cabinet Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMAS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have been attempts to do that in other ways. It is no secret what has been happening in connection with the Ministry of Health Bill. My hon. Friends know nothing of the consultations that for two years took place as to whether a particular committee that has been mentioned was to boss the Minister and not to be subordinate to him, but a definite stand was taken by many of us against our own friends, in saying that the Minister must be responsible to Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMAS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the only sound system, and it appears to me that it would be better to negative this Amendment, and that the Home Secretary should draft a Clause giving effect to the right hon. Gentleman's suggestion. But let it be definitely understood that we shall oppose any committee that takes away the power of the Minister and hampers or cripples him as the only authority responsible to Parliament in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government cannot accept this Amendment as it stands, I am quite sure the Committee will realise that. It is quite different from anything that exists at the present time. The Shipping Controller's committee is totally different. That is an ordinary committee set up by Sir Joseph Maclay to advise himself, consisting, I think, mostly of gentlemen who give their services gratis. That is the sort of committee which the Minister designate would set up for himself if nothing was said in this Bill. I will tell the Committee precisely what is the proposal we shall make to take the place of this Amendment. It is based on Section 79 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906. It is set up in exactly the same way, and practically 	<i>mutatis mutandis</i>—
	<br><q><p>"The Minister may, if he thinks fit, appoint committee?, the members of which shall have special knowledge of the matters in question for the purpose of advising him upon any matter which may arise in the exercise of the powers and duties imposed upon him by this Act."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>361</span>
The result of that will be that he will have the power, supposing a dock question arises, to set up a committee consisting of gentlemen whose advice would be valuable upon that subject. If it is a railway matter it would be a committee consisting of gentlemen whose advice was of service upon that subject. The committees would consist of traders, of labour, or anyone whose opinion and advice would be valuable to the Minister upon any particular matter. That proposal is taken exactly from the precedent of the Merchant Shipping Act, the committees under which, I am told, have been extraordinarily valuable to the Board of Trade. Of course, any Member of the Committee can make any Amendment to that suggestion when it comes up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When do you propose to move it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My view is that it ought to come as a separate Clause after the Clauses which give the various powers and impose the various duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>An HON. MEMBER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will it be mandatory?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am asked if it will be mandatory. It will be exactly in the words of the Merchant Shipping Act, which is a good precedent, and I ask the Committee to accept it as a precedent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NORMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot help thinking that the Committee and the country will desire, in the matter of this consultative committee, something a little more statutory than has been suggested by the Home Secretary. His suggestion is of a purely permissive nature. The Minister can set up these committees or not as he likes. He can consult them or not as he likes. He has no obligation on his part nor are the public interests necessary afforded any measure of protection. In his interesting speech this morning the Minister-designate appeared to present us with a dilemma in this form, either that the committee appointed must consist only of heads of departments—and of course every Minister would wish to consult his heads of departments—or if it is more than that it would interfere with the direct responsibility of the Minister. His exact words were: "There must be the direct responsibility of the Minister." That dilemma does not arise. It is obvious that the Minister must have complete, final, and direct responsibility. Nobody and no committee in whatever form it may be set
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>362</span>
up can be allowed for a moment to interfere with, or to intervene between the direct responsibility of the Minister to the House of Commons and the country. Upon that I am sure we shall be agreed, and on that I agree with what has been said by the right hon. Member for Derby (Mr. Thomas).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dilemma does not arise because it is possible to have a committee which should be statutory, which should have certain powers and which would not limit or restrict the supreme responsibility of the Minister. I suggest a committee in this form. One makes it, because while it has become evident that we are in full sympathy with the principle of the Bill—with the principle of co-ordination of transportation powers—some of us fear that in a Bill of this kind this co-ordination may favour certain methods as against others. We want some safeguard in that matter. I believe it to be possible to secure this end without any danger. The suggestion is that there should be formed at the Transportation Ministry a Communications Council on the model of the Air Council. The Air Ministry is the latest and most modern Ministry to be set up, and I think it affords a good precedent for the kind of council we want. The Minister would be President of this Council. It would be formed of the heads of the branches of the Ministry, representing the heads of the different interests, railways, canals, harbours, roads, and so on. So far it would only be a departmental committee; it would only be that conference with the heads of departments to which the Minister-designate has already alluded. But it should be more than that. It should contain certain additional members. The words "additional members" occur in the Act of Parliament setting up the Air Ministry. It should contain certain additional members representing outside knowledge and interest, one for railways, one for canals, one for harbours, one for roads, and so on. Decisions would be in the name of the Communications Council, and I think that these decisions would carry greater weight than the decisions of any Minister. The additional members would be in closer touch with public interests outside than official members could possibly be. They would, of course, be unpaid members. They would uphold the public point of view in the conferences of the council, and their power and authority would arise in this way only, that if they saw at any time that the interests they specially represented were, in their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>363</span>
opinion, being so unfairly, improperly, or inadequately treated that they could no longer share responsibility for the decisions that were being made, they would, as a last resort, resign, and the resignation would immediately bring that particular issue before the public and before the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that while serving perfectly the principle of co-ordination, and while preserving perfectly the authority of the Minister a Clause of that kind would be received with much sympathy and much satisfaction by the vast interests represented in this Bill; a Bill so vast and unprecedented in its scope that we have no precedent for it in our history. No Bill that I have ever seen has had anything like the scope over the national interests as this Bill. My remarks and suggestions are not in the nature of hostile criticism. My suggestion is in the friendliest spirit possible. I believe that if some council of the kind were formed, the Minister, when he is appointed, would find that his work in the House of Commons would be very much easier than it would be under the arrangements already proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The suggestion made by the Home Secretary is one that was favourably discussed by the Dock Authorities. I suppose I am the only Member of the House who has been and is a Member of the Merchant Shipping Advisory Committee. That Committee was set up by Mr. Lloyd George because he said when he was President of the Board of Trade that it was impossible for any Minister to know the intricacies of shipping and he would set up a committee of experts. That committee is working very well. It has had some very hard discussions and it has been most useful, as we have heard from the lips of the Board of Trade, but it is not quite all that we could desire. I must candidly confess that our experiences were varied. When the Minister did not want to consult us he did not consult us. That occurred several times and called forth from us strong protests. There was always a promise of reform. We were to be called in on every occasion, but some occasions again occurred in which we were not called in. It is only fair to say, and it is only reasonable to expect that all our advice was not taken. We very often differed from the President of the Board of Trade and his advisers; but at the same time the Committee was a very valuable asset to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>364</span>
great industry for which it was set up. I think something like that might be done, but I rather prefer the suggestion of the hon. Member who has just spoken (Sir H. Norman). I think something on those lines would disarm a great deal of opposition that is going to be offered to this Bill. I do not know whether we should be content with that or whether we should fight in the meantime for something more. That all depends upon circumstances. At any rate, the suggestion of the hon. Member is one form of conciliation which I think will disarm a great deal of opposition, and I hope something on the lines of that suggestion will be carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NEAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newcastle (Mr. Renwick) made a speech of considerable force, but it struck me as being a speech the strength of which was in support of the proposal of the Minister rather than in support of the Amendment which he was moving. The Amendment which we are now discussing proposes the establishment of one advisory and consultative committee be limited in its number to six persons besides the president, and the constitution of the Committee is that there shall be only one member of it with railway experience, that there shall be two with dock experience, one with experience of the construction and management of roads, one dealing with canals, and one dealing with manufactures and commerce. The hon. Gentleman said that this question had not been submitted to the country at all. The Prime Minister, in the speech which he made in the Central Hall, Westminster, on 16th November last, among other vital and urgent necessities, dealt with the question of transportation in these words,
	<br><q><p>"Railways, canals, roads, trams, all vital to the life and industry and amenities of the people of this country—this problem must be taken, in hand under the direct inspiration and control of the State."</p></q>
I think that the hon. Member had forgotten that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NEAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then I do not know how to interpret it, because if there was one national spokesman at the General Election it was surely the Prime Minister, and what the Amendment before us suggests is a committee of six. What my hon. Friend in his speech recommended was frequent consultation with bodies of persons who have expert knowledge of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>365</span>
the subject under discussion. This consultative council if elected would have to deal with questions of railways, with only one expert railwayman upon it, and similarly with the other matters. I very much prefer the suggestion of the right hon. Gentleman in charge of the Bill that he should call to his council those in more substantial numbers who had the particular experience of these matters and were expert and skilled in them. I note with some dissatisfaction a good many references which might be distasteful to my right hon. Friend, as to his personality, but at least we may say this, that a Minister endowed with the usual common sense of an Englishman—[HON. MEMBERS: "A Scotsman"]—well, the greater includes the less—would, having regard to the magnitude of the task which is placed upon him, not only desire but be quite certain to call into consultation the great interests which are concerned, and the suggestion which has been made by the Home Secretary, coupled with the assurance which we have had from the right hon. Gentleman, the Minister-designate, that he will call into consultation these bodies, seems to me to cover the whole ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter may much more conveniently be discussed upon the Clause when it is brought up by the Home Secretary than upon this Amendment. He has dealt in advance, if I may say so, with the point raised by my right hon. Friend, the Member for Derby, when he said that surely upon all questions affecting labour he desires to take the line of least resistance and consult those directly interested in labour. He says that in matters relating to railways he would also call to his help the Railways Association. To those interested as are my hon. Friend the Member for Prestwich (Sir R. Adkins) and myself, in county councils and borough councils, he says that in questions affecting roads he will call into consultation those who are concerned. The objection to dealing with an Amendment of this kind is that it fails to realise the very important statement made by the right hon. Gentleman this morning that when he finally presents to Parliament his plans, upon which he suggests there should be permanent management, if not control, or if not ownership, of the transport services of this country, he desires then to present something that shall be statutory and permanent in the shape of great consultative bodies, to consult and advise the Minister in a permanent

manner, but in the interregnum before that time comes I would suggest that the Government have met the Committee in the fullest, fairest and frankest way, and that we might accept their suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SEXTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to be very long, but I do want to take this opportunity of saying that the Member for Dumbarton was not quite accurate when he said that he is the only Member of this House on this Committee who had some association with transport during the War under the Ministry of Shipping. Both myself and the right hon. Member for Derby served on the Transport Committee of the Ministry of Shipping.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a different committee altogether from what I spoke about. I spoke about the Shipping Advisory Committee. I do not think that there is any other member of this Committee who was a member of that Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SEXTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is rather a distinction without a difference, because we were under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Shipping on a very important committee. My native modesty prevents me saying how much that fact influenced the decision of the committee, for our experience was entirely different from that of the hon. Member for Dumbarton. The Minister consulted us on everything, and in reference to the expediting of the flow of traffic through our ports we met weekly and we have never yet been refused an opportunity on this committee of dealing with any question affecting our position on the committee. I think the statement of the Home Secretary meets the case fully without going any further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite sure that this discussion, though it has taken time, really advances the Bill. What has been said to-day by the Minister-designate and the Home Secretary has very much cleared the issue. I think that my hon. Friend who moved the Amendment would agree that its details are not adequate. You could not have a committee which did not specifically include labour, and we are in great difficulties if in the case of any one instance, we are limited to one person, but it has great value, I submit, in allowing us to discuss this matter before we get to the Clause which the Home Secretary has promised. On behalf of those who are connected with the great trunk roads of the country I desire to thank the Minister-

designate for his undertaking. I still do not despair of taking some small share in persuading him to do even better, but I am extremely grateful to him for his action in the matter. The Clause mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary was brought forward at a moment's notice, and, therefore, I may criticise it without criticising him. It does not appear to me fully to carry out the promise of the Minister-designate. That, of course, is a matter which we can discuss when we see it in print, and when we come to it. The Minister-designate in his speech conveyed to my mind a much more certain and a much fuller consultation of the different interests involved than is of necessity embodied in the words taken from the Merchant Shipping Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Beyond that, I hope that my right hon. Friend will consider very carefully the proposal made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Sir H. Norman). We are all agreed that the Minister must be supreme. We are all agreed that the consultative committee should be useful and might help him. This is not thwarting him, but in a scheme so wide and so great as this is, it is desirable if it can be devised, to have some committee, such as my right hon. Friend suggests, which at any rate would have the elementary right of protest by resignation and which would secure as continuously and as intimately as may be the knowledge and suggestions of unpaid official members in the happiest combination with the permanent heads of Departments in this great Ministry. We all know the inconvenience of discussing one adumbrated Amendment in a debate on another, but one wants to take this opportunity of asking the Government to consider very carefully this suggested Amendment, in connection with the proposal which the Home Secretary put down and, working from the basis which the Minister-designate laid down, I hope that we shall get something to satisfy us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir A. SHIRLEY BENN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Holding a rather different view on the question of a committee from that held by some of my hon. Friends, I would like to state it. I was one of those sent in December last to Westminster to support the Prime Minister in two things—one in carrying out the policy of getting peace and the second as to reconstruction. I hold that my duty is to support the Government in getting that reconstruction. If they consider that the best way to get reconstruction of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>368</span>
transport is to appoint the man whom they think best able to carry it out and if they appoint him Minister of Transport, I think that the Government should be responsible. Let them nominate the best man they can and if the result is unsatisfactory we can look to the Government, and if the Government have not done their duty we can turn them out. I think that any sane Minister—nobody will accuse the Minister-designate of lacking sanity—will get all the information he possibly can, and will get it from the very best sources, and use that information when he puts forward any plan. I, for one, feel very strongly that he ought not to be hampered in any way in dealing with the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain HAMILTON BENN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Amendment which we are discussing is entirely satisfactory. It does not entirely meet the case. Nor do I think the proposal of the Home Secretary is adequate. The proposal made by the right hon. Member for Blackburn seems much more satisfactory, and possibly, if formulated, would form a more satisfactory basis for what we want. The main objection to, and a great deal of trouble in connection with, this Bill seems to me to be the un-British and dictatorial tone of it. It is setting up a dictatorship—or, rather, a prolongation of D.O.R.A. for another two years in the hands of one Minister. A great deal has been said about the Minister-designate, and I do not want to labour the point, but really, the Bill is a sort of "shut your eyes and open your mouth and see what I will do for you." It is quite different from anything we have ever had in the whole course of our English history. We do not even know that the Minister-designate is going to continue as Minister for another two years. His own record during the past four years of war has given the impression that he does not stay long in any one job. This is certainly a position which requires a man to remain in it and to thoroughly study it. We had a curious experience with the Government at the late election. That election was fought largely from the point that the Government was the best Government that could possibly be found to make the peace, it having won the War. But directly it was returned to Parliament there was a change all round of Ministers from one post to another. The point I want to bring before the Committee is this, that it is most essential to have an Advisory Committee—that is, a continuing Committee and not one in the hands of one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>369</span>
Minister who may change it from time to time. We want, in fact, continuity; we want an Advisory Committee set up of the type suggested in connection with the Air Ministry, and if that were agreed to it would, I think, do away with a great deal of the objection to the Bill which is entertained at the present time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel MURRAY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although there is only one Amendment before the Committee we are really at the moment considering three proposals—the Amendment, the proposal of the Home Secretary, and the proposal of the right hon. Baronet the Member for Blackburn (Sir H. Norman). It seems to me that the proposal of the Government does not impose a sufficient statutory obligation on the Ministers to consult the Committee which it is proposed to set up. I am somewhat inclined to agree with the proposal put forward by the right hon. Member for Blackburn, and I would suggest that the Committee discuss that a little further. If we to-day accept the suggestions of the Home Secretary we shall never get back to the proposal of my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn, and I certainly would like to see that proposal discussed a little more. May I suggest in addition to the Minister-designate in charge of the Bill that I believe we also have with us to-day the Parliamentary Under-Secretary-designate (if I may so put it) who has had considerable experience on the Air Council. I think it would be very valuable if he could see his way to give the Committee his views regarding the proposal of the right hon. Member for Blackburn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ALEXANDER RICHARDSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Motion which is down on the Paper is entirely different from that proposed by the Home Secretary. This Bill is set up to secure unification, but instead of that we now have a proposal we do not want—that the canals, roads and railways should all be in watertight compartments, so that instead of having unification in council you are going to set up a great number of separate watertight compartment committees which are to be called in at the will of the Minister, and their opinions are to be taken accordingly as he likes. Nearly every item from A to G in Clause 2 deals with severely technical matters. No one man can be an expert in all these technical matters and consequently it is of the greatest need that the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>370</span>
should have with him assistants who are experts in these matters. You cannot coordinate unless you have sitting at the same table men who are experts in each item, so that their views may be considered alongside the views of other, and perhaps contending, interests. It is for that reason I think that the suggestion of an advisory board is a very useful one; certainly such a board ought to be set up. It would not interfere with the supreme responsibility of the Minister of Ways and Communications, and it would assist enormously. It would be a committee almost exactly parallel to the Munitions Board. There you had technical questions of great importance dealt with, and you had sitting on that board men who gave their services voluntarily and freely to the Government because they were experts. [An HON. MEMBER: "So you will have here."] It is not so provided. It is not necessarily in the Act. I suggest it ought to be provided in the Act, and the omission of provision for such an advisory board is, in my opinion, the cause of that immense amount of suspicion which has arisen throughout the country. We have here a Bill which is creating, and perhaps, desirably creating an autocrat, because after all you must have an autocrat if you are going to get things done. The objection on the part of the country is this: that innumerable boards—railway boards, dock boards, canal boards, and electric boards are to be absolutely superseded so far as the management of their individual undertakings is concerned, and what is necessary is a strong and continuous link between the Minister and these different undertakings. That link could best be established in the form of a consultative committee which will include, as my right hon. Friend suggests, the heads of Departments and representatives of all the interests concerned. They would be elected as the Minister-designate suggests, or chosen, by reason of their influence, their technical knowledge, and their representative character. I submit that such committee ought to be provided for in the Bill, and if that were done it would allay the suspicion which exists. You must allay that suspicion if this Bill is going to be a success. There is no use in forcing the Bill on the country and on these public bodies which have done so splendidly in the past unless you allay that suspicion, and it can only be allayed by the creation of such an executive body as I have suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any opinion I may express will be perfectly disinterested and not at all affected by any ideas which can come into collision with the Minister. But I do frankly urge the right hon. Gentleman in charge of this Bill, and especially the Minister-designate, before coming to any conclusion to give careful consideration to the suggestion of my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn. I do not know there are many Members in the present House of Commons who were there in the first year of the 1906 Parliament, but speaking as one of those unfortunate invertebrate animals which were under the harrow in those days—we were a very small minority—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not under the harrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I admit we did afterwards buck up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly prefer the legislation of 1918, and the experience we then had when we set up the Air Ministry, to the legislation of the Parliament of 1906. I venture to say that the War has taught us the necessity for taking into consultation and paying great attention to the opinions of these men, and not merely consulting them when it is convenient and passing them over when it is not, or taking their decisions sometimes and ignoring them at other times, like the evil counsels of the Plantagenet king. That is not the kind of committee that the War has made us see the necessity for. What our war experience has justified is a committee upon which everybody must be and should be consulted and it should be mandatory to take its opinions. Therefore the legislation of last year and the line adopted in setting up an Air Ministry is far more likely to be successful in this case than the somewhat autocratic position created by the Act of 1906. I am reminded, and I think it is true, that if this Bill, in terms, had been before the country any man seekng the suffrages of a large industrial centre at the last Election would not have succeeded in the contest. There is quite sufficient in this Bill to cause such animosity that if put as an issue to the electors it would not have survived. The Government have the power and opportunity now of so moulding their scheme on the precedent which they have got in the Air Ministry Act and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>372</span>
adapting anything in the Act of 1906 which might with advantage be incorporated into it. They have the opportunity in so doing to kill the suspicion in the country with regard to the method in which these great powers are going to be worked. For myself I have great confidence that the Minister will do the thing that is right. On the Second Reading I urged the right hon. Gentleman to hold the firmest hand over those gentlemen who have become popularly known to us as Dilly and Dally, and to take care that the real mind of the country is consulted in regard to their policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that in the debate which has taken place on this Amendment two lines of thought have gradually evolved. One is the line the Minister has taken up that the committee appointed should be appointed by himself, and responsible to himself, that it should be a committee 	<i>ad hoc</i>, a railway committee which he may consult about railways, and a dock committee which he may consult as regards docks. But such committees are likely to be the creatures of the Minister. I have listened very patiently to the debate on this Amendment, and that is what I apprehend to be the line of thought evolved. On the other hand it is suggested there should be a coordinating committee which would not over-ride the Minister. I agree with my hon. Friend, the Member for Middleton (Sir R. A. Adkins) that the Minister must be primarily and finally responsible to Parliament for what is done under the provisions of this Bill. A great many of us agree with what was said by the Hon. Member for Gravesend (Mr. Richardson) just now that we want to feel that there is behind the Minister to a certain extent an independent consultative body to whom he may refer great questions. I do not mean questions as to whether he shall elect to buy this or that bit of railway but I refer to great questions which may arise between the railways and the docks, between the railways and the roads, and questions as to electrification and so on. I submit that these are questions which should be referred to a statutory committee and not merely to a personal committee composed of great executive officers. One may frankly say that a committee of heads of Department is not the committee we require. Any head of a great business naturally calls his managers together and consults them almost every day as to the course of business. But
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>373</span>
that is not a committee which has any real power; so long as the members of it are servants they can only advise. They have no real power. I am not going to ask my hon. Friend, the Member for Newcastle, to divide on this Amendment because I want to see the Amendment of the Government on the Paper. I want, too, to suggest to Ministers very strongly the proposal of my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn. I further want to remind them of a later precedent which we had only last week in the Grand Committee on the Ministry of Health Bill, where a statutory consultative committee was set up under the control of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is quite a different matter. It was as the Minister liked. It was merely an elaborate and decorative form of Committee to which it is the right of every Minister to ask people to come to talk to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to my hon. and learned Friend. The great difference between the two is that that consultative council was established by Order in Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg my hon. and learned Friend's pardon. I have the Debate here, and the Bill as it passed through Committee said
	<br><q><p>"It shall be lawful for His Majesty by Order in Council to establish a Consultative Council."</p></q>
If a Committee of this kind be established by Order in Council it has a definite Parliamentary and quasi statutory position. If it is merely a calling together by a Minister of the heads of Departments, it has no real position and no real authority in the country. I would suggest to my right hon. Friend that before he puts his words down he should carefully consider whether he cannot meet those of us who want a little more power and authority given to this committee, and that he should adopt some such form of words as those in the Ministry of Health Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to assist the progress of the Committee, and I would suggest that as we are talking about three things we ought to have put down the proposal of the Government, and, if it is possible, the proposal of the hon. Baronet the Member for Blackburn (Sir H. Norman). I do not want to argue the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>374</span>
question now, but to reserve any remarks until we see the definite proposal before us. We are really talking round the subject without knowing exactly what is proposed. Might I suggest that we should have put down this afternoon both the proposal of the Government and that of the hon. Baronet the Member for Blackburn? Then we can debate the matter and clear it up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid the hon. Member is asking for too much should he desire a new Clause to be put down this afternoon. I am sure the Home Secretary will get his Clause ready as early as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we cannot have the actual Clauses, can we have the words which will be proposed by the Government as an alternative to those of the hon. Member for Blackburn, so that we can discuss the principle this afternoon?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I get quite disturbed by hon. Members getting up with these suggestions. We shall have had a discussion upon the principle, then when the new Clause comes up we shall get another discussion upon the principle and upon the words, and it seems to me that we shall not make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the simplest way would be for the hon. Member for Newcastle to withdraw his Amendment. Then perhaps the right hon. Member for Blackburn might put his Amendment down for this afternoon. We can then discuss his Amendment, which apparently is the one the Committee would like to discuss. It might be that the Government would see their way to accept it or to amend it so that it would not be necessary to bring up a new Clause at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite willing to agree to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before that Question is put, may I ask how the right hon. Gentleman's Amendment will be brought in? I suggest the best way would be for us to adjourn now and meet, perhaps, twenty minutes earlier and then have the Amendment brought in. In order to put myself in order, I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>"That the Committee do now adjourn."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. LOWE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very desirable that we should have the Government's Clause on the Paper at the same time as that of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Blackburn, but it is not desirable that the Government should be rushed. This is a very important matter and they want time to consider it. Some arrangement should be made whereby they will have sufficient time to thoroughly consider the Clause. It is one of the most important points in the whole Bill. To expect them to elaborate a new Clause now on so important a point and to put it on the Paper this afternoon is asking too much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really cannot see why it is necessary that the question of a consultative board or committee should be decided on Clause 1. The Government's proposal would not in any case be brought in as an Amendment to Clause 1, but as a new Clause, and I gather that my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn would have to move his Amendment as a new Clause also. The matter does not seem to have any connection with Clause 1 of necessity. I would therefore ask the Committee to let us get on as far as we can in the next twenty minutes. It is a matter which we cannot think out in two minutes. It is very much better that we should have time. That may enable me to have some discussion with my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn which would be very valuable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand that my right hon. Friend will do what he can to get the discussion on the subject on his own Clause and that of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Blackburn taken together, if possible, at some stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of that, I think we might pass the Clause now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Home Secretary suggested some little time ago that he would bring in his proposal as an Amendment to Clause 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant that it would come as a new Clause after Clause 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is brought in as a new Clause it means that it will be taken at the end of the Clauses in the Bill and after we have discussed the whole of the details of the Bill, and the question whether this, that, or the other is brought within the purview of the Bill.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>376</span>
A great deal will depend upon the view the Committee takes of the right hon. Gentleman's proposal. Could he try to get his Amendment as a new Sub-section to Clause 3?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will try to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason that I suggested that the discussion should be taken after lunch was because I understood that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Blackburn desired to move his Amendment at this particular point. I would further observe that we have been discussing this particular point for a considerable time, and therefore if the Amendment were moved now the discussion would be fresh in the minds of hon. Members. On the other hand, if we postpone the matter until we get to the new Clauses, we shall have forgotten all the arguments and probably shall start a fresh point upon a new subject. Therefore it would be far better if my original proposal were carried—that is, of course, if the right hon. Gentleman agrees. I do not know whether he does. If he is in a position to draft his proposal now and put it on the Paper or put in a manuscript Amendment, it could be discussed when we meet again at four o'clock. That would save time. I do not in any way desire to waste time. That course would enable the Home Secretary to avoid bringing up a new Clause. After the Home Secretary has heard the speech of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Blackburn, if he thinks it is impossible to take action now, he can say so, and probably the Committee would agree to go on to the next point. It would be wise to try to arrange something now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An Amendment to Clause 1 would make the Clause clumsy and unusual. The proper place would be to insert an Amendment to Clause 2 as a proviso. Clause 2 describes the powers and duties of the Minister, and contains two provisoes somewhat limiting them. The Amendment would be appropriate there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I venture to suggest to the Committee that the proposed Clause would be a Clause of a far-reaching character. To take it by way of a manuscript Amendment, without having the actual terms before one, seems to be asking the Committee to undertake a very difficult task. I would suggest that we dispose of Clause 1 now, and that

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>377</span>
at the earliest convenient moment the Amendment in the form of a new Clause or whatever other form it takes shall be printed, so that we, as a Committee, may have a print of the proposal before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NORMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the proposed Amendment my view is entirely that expressed by the right hon. Baronet (Sir F. Banbury). I had supposed that it would come in as an addition to Clause 1, but, of course, in that matter I am entirely in the hands of the Committee and the Home Secretary. I quite agree with the right hon. Baronet that after our long discussion it would seem to be in principle undesirable that the discussion should be allowed to lapse and get cold and that we should have to restart it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NEAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out that there is an Amendment to Clause 2, standing in the name of the hon. Member for Eccles (Mr. Stevens), which raises this question again. That is the Amendment to insert the words "In conjunction with the boards to be established under this Act." That raises the same question and might be an opportunity for discussing the matter in a more concrete form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That Amendment is out of order in the form in which it is drawn, because it raises the question of a board again, and I could not take an Amendment raising that question again. What we are discussing is a consultative body, which is an entirely different proposition to the one we have already negatived.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. We did not negative the Amendment with regard to a board. That was, by leave, withdrawn, which leaves the matter open.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I really guarded myself against being placed in that position, because I said that it was understood that in the withdrawing of that Amendment, the Amendments on the Paper to Clause 1, page 1, line 7 and line 9, would be treated as being out of order. Carrying that out, I am bound to treat the Amendment to which the hon. Member refers, which raises the same point, as being out of order. I hope I may have the help of the Committee in this matter. The Minister in charge of the Bill has suggested a way in which the Committee can be met upon this very important point. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>378</span>
think we might take his guidance upon the matter, and I suggest that the Motion for the adjournment be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shall we be able to amend Clause 2?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We cannot possibly discuss these proposals this afternoon, If we are to discuss them in a way worthy of the name of discussion, we must consider the proposal of the right hon.

is in order, but I would suggest that the point be taken on the Amendment standing in the name of the hon. Member for the Ladywood Division of Birmingham (Mr. N. Chamberlain).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree. That Amendment comes in a better position than my own, and I am quite willing to withdraw in my hon. Friend's favour.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment is out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMAS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can you accept even that amended Amendment, which may run counter to the Clause ultimately agreed upon of the Home Secretary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I must rule it out of order. It is too fragmentary a way to deal with the question which, as I understand, the hon. Member desires to raise—that of consultative committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the matter I referred to with regard to the objections to any Amendment or a new Clause being brought in under Clause 3. I could quite foresee all sorts of difficulties which are likely to arise with regard to these various Amendments, and I hope at all events the matter will not be pressed in this way because my hon. Friend is desirous of moving this in conjunction with the agreement which has been come to with the Government. If, on the other hand, we say all these Amendments cannot be dealt with until the new Clause is brought in by the Government, you will appreciate the difficult position in which the Committee will find itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposal of the Government is to bring up some words to institute some kind of advisory committee. I suggest that there is nothing in this which is inconsistent with the Government proposal. "In conjunction with the advisory committees to be established under the provisions of this Act." These might be either advisory committees suggested in a later new Clause by the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I alter the Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is rather trespassing upon the indulgence of the Committee to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. Surely it is only a question of words, and perhaps putting in something which will make it perfectly logical. If there is no appointment of committees it will be inoperative. It is still perfectly regular on the face of the Statute. The suggestion the hon. Member now desires to make is a question of not being able to get an apt word to meet the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must ask for the co-operation of the Committee. I have been trying to tell the Committee that the Minister is not ready to deal with the question. He has undertaken to bring up a Clause in some form or other which can be discussed. In addition to that, when I have ruled an Amendment out of order, the hon. Member has had a chance to amend it, and it is still out of order, it is asking much that the Committee should stand by and allow Amendment after Amendment until by some kind of accident he gets in order. I must ask the Committee not to ask me to be a party to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If you thought you saw your way to allow this issue to be raised on these words which would then come before (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>), (	<i>d</i>), (	<i>e</i>), (	<i>f</i>), (	<i>g</i>), and the important words of this Clause—in other words, the determination of this question if arrived at prior to the consideration of these eight classes of undertakings might have a considerable effect on the opposition or criticism which they are sure to arouse. It is in the interest of getting on with the Bill that I ask you whether there is any form of words which would in your judgment be in order so as to allow the issue of advisory councils or committees to be determined before the various categories of powers are settled by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of Order. How can I say whether it will be in order till I see the words? I am bound to ask the Committee to proceed with the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>382</span>
Amendments on the Paper. The Amendment of the hon Member (Mr. Joynson-Hicks)—[after the word "duties," insert the words "under the Acts and Orders set out in the Schedule hereto"]—is out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposal of the Amendment is to try to get from the Government, which we have not got yet, a list of the Acts of Parliament and Orders which are to be transferred to the new Ministry. We are here transferring a whole mass of powers. We do not know what they are. A Return has been made by Order of the House of Commons on some of these points, and I suggest it is in the power of the Committee to say that there shall be transferred to the Ministry certain particular powers set out in the Schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is out of order because he has provided for no Schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>"(	<i>c</i>) light railways."</p></q>
I have been in considerable difficulty in approaching this for the reason set out by the hon. Gentleman (Sir R. Adkins), because if we really knew how far the Minister-designate was prepared to meet us it would possibly very largely dissipate any objection I have to the Clause. That is the difficulty I find myself in, and that is why I say it would be a very great advantage to learn precisely how far he is prepared to meet us in regard to the matter of consultative councils. The principal reason which actuated me in putting the Amendment down was due to the manner in which the Minister-designate treated the whole question of light railways on the Second Reading. He practically said there was no use whatever for these undertakings, and he hardly knew why they had ever been set up, and he had come to the conclusion that at the end of these two years those undertakings, unless there was someone to look after them, would practically be derelict and be handed back to their original proprietors in a derelict condition. If, on the other hand, we were assured that the Minister will agree to a consultative Council that would meet my objection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

simply because there is no security at the time it is dealt with that any advisory committees will be set us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. I suggest that we might get along a great deal better if we adjourned until, say, tomorrow morning, to give the Government an opportunity of bringing in their measure. Many of these points, (	<i>a</i>) to (	<i>g</i>), we may be able to support if, for instance, the right hon. Gentleman will bring in such an Amendment. We shall be bound otherwise to fight many of these points because we do not know what Amendment is going to be brought in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think we could possibly be ready for a proper discussion tomorrow, and in any case does the Committee really believe if we arranged some form of committee we should have any shorter discussion upon the docks or the roads?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move that we adjourn until tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We settled our rules to-day, and in arranging the Standing Orders for the Committee we put in the proviso for yesterday that we should adjourn at one o'clock until this morning.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First of all, I would like to thank the Minister-designate for the statement which removes to a great extent the objections entertained by those of us who may be regarded as "traffic expert advisers" for a large portion of the trade of the country. Upon this question of light railways the Committee should know that there are two descriptions of what is called a light railway—one entirely the same physically as the ordinary railway, and the other of an entirely different gauge altogether. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>384</span>
am referring now, in supporting this Amendment, to the light railway which, for all practical purposes, is the same as the ordinary statutory railway—to the light railway obtained under the powers of the Light Railway Commissioners, and, subsequently, with full Parliamentary powers, the same statutory powers for the conveyance of merchandise as are obtained by the great main line railways of the country. Upon one of these light railways there is a traffic of 2,000,000 tons of general merchandise per annum. That is to say, it has a greater merchandise traffic than any main line traffic in the South of England except the South-Western and the Great Western. And yet it has been treated with absolute ignominy by the railway companies and the railway executive. It is a feeder of no less than five of the big main lines, and to illustrate the manner in which this railway and others would be dealt with if, as my right hon. Friend suggested this morning, the matter were left to the Railway Association, let me show what has happened in the past. The Railway Association do not consider this a railway within their purview. The executive, in reporting to the Board of Trade, whilst including several other light railways in the country, did not include such light railways as the one to which I am referring. Throughout the whole period of the War this light railway, with a traffic greater than three-fourths of the railways of the country, had no consideration at all. Strangely enough, the result has not been that that light railway is in the unfortunate position which the Minister-designate is in regarding those railways he is to take over under the Bill, for instead of that light railway being a loser in the War, it has doubled its traffic, and to-day is paying its shareholders 5 per cent. free of Income Tax, and that with receipts of 1d., 2d., and 3d. per ton on its traffic as compared with 1s., 2s., and 3s. per ton paid in respect of the main line railways alongside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I remind the hon. Member that the Amendment is to leave out paragraph (	<i>b</i>). I do not see where we are going at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to show the Committee that unless there is some such Clause as we are asking for, it is necessary that the light railways should be excluded, because it would never do for light railways of this character to come under the Railways Association, as would be the case if the Committee set up for railways were the Railway Association Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>385</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ROYCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the inclusion of this paragraph, and at the same time draw the attention of the Committee to a statement made by the Prime Minister at Manchester on the 12th September, when he said
	<br><q><p>"We must use our national resources and the State must help and encourage production."</p></q>
The Division I represent is purely agricultural, and we estimate that if light railways of a suitable type are introduced we can increase the present production by 30 per cent. at least. We have an arable area greater by 10 per cent. than any other country in the Kingdom, and we have some 13,000 acres which are not nearer than seven miles to a railway station, and some are ten miles away. Further than that, we have a great scheme of reclamation and development which can only be successful if access is obtainable by railway. The amount of cultivated land within a two-mile radius of the twenty-two railway stations of the county is only 15 per cent. of the total. Witb an average "lead" of three miles, we have to carry, roughly speaking, 1,250,000 tons of export and 600,000 tons of imports, and I think it can safely be said we carry two million tons of produce and of materials to points three miles distant at a cost of £300,000—Is. per ton per mile—without any charge for road maintenance. From these figures you will see at once that we have a problem in our county which can only be solved by a light railway, and when I speak of a light railway, I mean one of standard gauge. There is no question of the utility of railways in a county such as ours which is comparatively level throughout. I have in mind at the moment a railway in the construction of which I had no ïnconsiderable interest. It is a hundred miles in length, it has a two-foot gauge and the ordinary goods wagons carry 15 tons—a reflection in that connection on the rolling stock of our main lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might I suggest to the hon. Member that he should read a speech by the Minister-designate in regard to this very question, and then he would not come here to promote light railways for the benefit of agricultural counties. The Minister said that they only earned 2 per cent.; that their expenses had gone up, and there could be no doubt they must be working at a considerable loss. Then he goes on to discuss the Decauville system as no good for this country, and declares that to lay down a track for agricultural
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>386</span>
purposes would be a waste of money. Is the hon. Gentleman coming here to ask us to lay down one of these railways?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend tell me where I said this railway was no good, and if he is correct in his quotation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In column 1770 of the OFFICIAL REPORT for the 17th March—
	<br><q><p>"The maintenance and cost of a Decauville track is so heavy that to put it down in this country for agricultural use would simply be throwing away money. I think there is a possibility of developing the light railway, and it has been developed in the rich districts of Northern France and Belgium."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But I want my hon. Friend to read it as it appears in the OFFICIAL REPORT, and not leave out little bits to suit himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am really a very great student of my right hon. Friend's speeches. He has missed a little bit, and I am going on to complete the sentence—
	<br><q><p>"I think there is a possibility of developing the light railway as it has been developed in the rich districts of Northern France and Belgium I think there is a possibility of developing light electric railways for inter-urban traffic. Decauville railways strewn all over the country, and run by farmers, is a dream. It is a thing that will never exist successfully. I think that we must look to the development of motor traction…."</p></q>
Have I not made out my case that my right hon. Friend's own view is that light railways are no good for agricultural work? I think it is perfectly clear that, in his opinion, he may be right or wrong, light railways are no use for agricultural purposes, and that we must look to the development of motor traction for our agricultural areas. I do not want to bandy words with my right hon. Friend. I rise to ask him what his plans are. We are entitled to ask the Minister-designate. He asks us to give him power over light railways. We must ask him what his scheme is. It is held that there are numerous plans held up before the Commissioners for various reasons. Is my right hon. Friend going to finance them? I suggest that if he is, he is wasting a good deal of public money in ill-considered schemes. It is our duty as Members of the House of Commons to ask him, and to press for an answer, what his plans are in regard to each one of these different modes of traction. I do not want to ask him in detail, but what are his general plans and

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>387</span>
views with regard to the possibility of using light railways for agricultural purposes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Committee to come back to the Amendment? The one point we are dealing with is, Are the powers of the Board of Trade with regard to light railways to be transferred to this Ministry? When the Ministry is formed, then will be the time to discuss the best form of light railways. After all, light railways are an integral part of the means of transport necessary for the industrial life of the country. We have already discussed how necessary co-ordination is. I ask the Committee to say—and I ask my hon. Friend not to press his Amendment—if you are going to have this Ministry and it is to deal with all the means of Ways and Communications, if it is going to be a means of developing the agricultural industry, housing, and what not, light railways are an essential part of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMAS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will only press this point. I do not know for whom my hon. Friend was speaking when he referred to his particular light railway, but the Board of Trade will tell him that when the railways were taken over practically the whole of the light railways of this country made application to be taken over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMAS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I speak of 90 per cent. of them. Incidentally a number of the light railways are now taken over. Supposing the Amendment is carried, it means that the Minister of Transport controls the trunk lines of the country, but controls part of the light railways, because some are already taken over and controlled by the Railway Executive Committee, and you leave out, perhaps, some 10 per cent. of the light railways to be controlled by the Board of Trade. The Committee will agree that that would be absurd. Never mind whether they ought to be developed or scrapped, can you conceive of any unification when one set of railways is controlled by the Minister and the other by the Board of Trade, and part of the light railways controlled by this Minister because they are part of the Railway Executive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Bill. I, at any rate, and many of my people, are looking forward to the inclusion of (	<i>b</i>) in order that we may be able to grapple effectively with the bad housing conditions that exist in the various mining-areas in the county of Durham to-day. When we commence to grapple with the housing conditions the great problem is the finding of land, and we cannot get land to-day. In order to get useful land to enable us to deal with housing and town-planning schemes so that we may establish decent homes for the people, we have to go out of the area, and to go out of the area there must be means of communication. The people must be able to travel conveniently backward and forward to the mines and other work. This is one of the great hopes we have. What hope is there for workers if they are to be circumscribed in narrow areas where there is no land to build upon, and the distance is too far, unless this comes to relieve us? We believe that if the agricultural districts are to be developed—and many Members are desirous that they should be—we must have access to the land. If you take out of the Bill either (	<i>b</i>) or (	<i>c</i>) there can be no legitimate hope for problems of reconstruction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The reason for putting down the Amendment arises from the fact that when the Minister-designate introduced his Bill the attention of the House was largely focussed on the enormous loss the country was suffering on railways—£250,000 a day. I do not understand why tramways figure in the Bill at all. I remember a part of the right hon. Gentleman's speech. It dealt with this question of tramways, and he told the House that tramways were very well managed and a good paying industry, returning 7 per cent., and then went on to tell the House that they were excluded from the Bill. That is my point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

company to come to Parliament to obtain running powers over Manchester and Salford before an arrangement could be come to. Under this Clause it is different entirely from the last.

I think neither the municipalities nor the well-managed companies would like too much interference in the carrying of their passengers locally. I think the Committee ought to know exactly what is the extent of those powers.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F.

But I should like to draw attention to the municipal tramways being left out of the Bill. The Minister-designate, in his speech on the Second Reading, said there was a 7 per cent. profit on all the tramway undertakings as a whole. I happen to know something about it in respect to the London County Council tramways. Although it may be said that they are only a small proportion of the tramways of this country, they represent £14,000,000 or £15,000,000 sterling of capital. When he states that there is 7 per cent. profit on the capital of the tramways, I turn to the last published accounts of the London County Council tramways, 1916-17. This says,
	<br><q><p>"Up to the year 1911-12 full provision for this renewals fund has been made out of revenue at the rate of two-thirds of 1d. per car mile run, approved in 1908, but in the year 1912-13 the amount available for transfer from net revenue account was only £497 9s. 3d. No account was available in the three years 1913-14 to 1915-16. In 1916-17 a surplus of £11,342 10s. 3d. is available as shown and has been transferred."</p></q>
My reason for mentioning these figures is to show that the London tramways are not carried at 7 per cent. profit on the capital, irrespective of the cost of renewals, which must be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

hon. Gentleman the Minister-designate on the Second Reading? He said then that the municipal tramways were to be excluded, and I was trying to point out that the figures he used were wrong, although he admitted that the tramways were well run and managed, and that was the reason for excluding them. I am not going to enter into that now, but if the municipal tramways are to be excluded because they are well managed, surely that would be a consideration when we come to the question of the docks and other authorities. I do not think we can really get on with the Bill until we have seen what the Government intentions are. I do not think it is in the interests of the communities that we should go on with this discussion until we know what is the authority which is going to be set up. In order that this information may be given, I ask leave to move to report Progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I feel that we are in a most extraordinary position with regard to this Clause. The Government has undertaken to make a drastic alteration in the Clause from (	<i>a</i>) to (	<i>g</i>), and that deals with the whole question of what body it is going to set up. We cannot deal with the functions of that body until we know what it is going to be. Instead of coming in on this Clause now, it is left until a later part of the Bill, and then the whole of these matters will have to be discussed. I think it is hardly fair to ask us to go on until the Government has made a statement clearing up these important points, especially as to what authority is going to be set up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The only powers affecting tramways proposed to be transferred are dealt with in Clause 2, paragraph 1. The Paper states that this

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>393</span>
list is subject to alteration and revision. The powers referred to are those of the Board of Trade, and are,
	<br><q><p>"Grant of Provisional Orders authorising tramway undertakings and issue of authority to public bodies to raise loans for such undertakings. Examination of Bilk promoted by light railway and tramway undertakings. Confirmation of bylaws with regard to regulation of traffic on light railways and tramways."</p></q>
These are the powers of the Board of Trade taken over by Clause 2. With regard to what has fallen from the Member for Dulwich (Sir F. Hall), the matter that he was dealing with comes under Clause 3. That deals with the power to take possession of undertakings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Vehicles and traffic thereon do not arise at present. Roads chiefly come in under the provisions to transfer powers from one Department to another. You will find them in the Command Paper No. 58, set out as the powers and functions conferred upon the Road Board by the Development and Roads Improvement Funds Act, 1909. It includes all those powers which are exercised by the Local Government Board under the various Highways, Locomotive, and Motor Car Acts, and the power of deciding whether roads should be main roads or ordinary highways, and of confirming Rules and Regulations with regard to carriages using tramways, and also powers over borrowing money and dealing with highways and bridges. All these powers are to be transferred from the Local Government Board to the new Ministry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You see there is an enormous mass of powers which are going to be, under the provisions of this apparently innocent Sub-section, transferred from various authorities to the new Minister. My first point is with regard to the powers of the Road Board under the Act of 1909. That Board, as the Committee knows, was the child of the present Prime Minister. It was established by him in 1909. I remember that I had the honour of sitting on the Grand Committee, in this very room, which dealt with the Bill. I remember that the Local Government Board, then represented by Mr. John Burns, was very keen and eager that the powers of the Road Board
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>394</span>
should be put under the Local Government Board, so as to keep it in touch with the other authorities dealing with roads. But the Prime Minister was very firm. He said, "This is a particular Bill dealing with a particular question, and I want it kept under the Treasury"—he was then Chancellor of the Exchequer—"in order that it may be separate from other powers of the Local Government Board relating to roads."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That Bill was very largely a motorists' Bill. It arose from the complaints which were made, and which have been repeated before this Committee yesterday, that the roads were and are still being used by people who decline to pay their share. The money which that Board dealt with, and still deals with, is money paid by motorists under special taxation put on them for that purpose. It may be said that I speak specially for motorists. That is perfectly true, but I may repeat that I have no financial interest of any kind in motoring. I simply am a devotee of the road. I want it to be realised what the powers in question are. There are about 160,000 miles of road in this country, and it is interesting to note that our country is the best roaded country in the world. I believe we have a mile of high road to every half square mile of land throughout the country. That is higher than in any other European country. Germany, which is supposed to be so wonderful, has only a mile of high road to ten square miles of land, and so it goes on to the more remote countries like Russia. We have the best mileage of roads of any country in the world as compared with our area—certainly we had until just before the War. That is very largely the work of the Road Board and of General Maybury. The motorists gladly paid this special tax without complaining at all, in order that it might be devoted specially to road purposes. It amounted to about £1,250,000 per annum before the War, and it amounts to a great deal more now. It is calculated that next year, on the basis of the present taxation on petrol and on licences for vehicles, it will amount to £7,000,000. That is money which would be paid into a special fund if this Bill were not passed or if my Amendment is adopted, and would be dealt with by the Road Board definitely for the improvement of roads. My right hon. Friend told us the other day that the total cost of the maintenance of the roads of this country is only £20,000,000 per annum, and he said
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>395</span>
it was £12,500,000 before the War. Today, owing to increased traffic during the War, it is £20,000,000, so that next year motorists will be paying in taxation £7,000,000 out of the £20,000,000 which is the total cost of road maintenance. In view of that, I think I am entitled to ask that it shall no longer be said that motorists are selfish people who object to pay for their use of the roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Personally I go very much further. I think it is detrimental to the commerce and agriculture of the country that transport itself should be taxed. I think that the roads should be open to all, but I do not want to get out of order and shall be dealing with this matter on a later Clause. It certainly would be a retrograde policy to go back to the old turnpike system, which is what, in effect, a tax on vehicles would be. But, as we are paying this tax now, we think that, paying the piper, we are entitled to call the tune.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This money is the money of the motorists, which is taken from them by taxation. I suggest that the Road Board has done wonders in the past. It has been, so to speak, the buffer state between the local authorities, the road users, and the Government. It has provided funds for easing corners, and in some cases for the maintenance of roads, improvement of bridges, and so forth. I venture to suggest that it is only fair that that body, which has done such good work in the past, should be allowed to continue to do its good work in the future. I cannot quite see in this Bill whether the money is earmarked especially for road purposes, as it ought to be, or whether it is to be put into the hands of a Minister who is primarily—I do not use the word offensively—concerned with the management and control of railways in this country. He told us quite frankly in the House of Commons that the railways have this £100,000,000 deficit, and that somehow or other he has to do his best to make that up. I agreed that he should do his best to make it up, but I strongly object to his attempting to make it up at the expense of the road users of the country. I suggest that in the immediate past, and in the immediate future, roads have been and are going to be more and more the competitors of the railways. It cannot be helped. I am sorry for the railways, but the road is going to be increasingly a competitor of the railway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Derby realises that fact. I am speaking now, not of the pleasure car—that is a very small item in this matter—but of commercial road traffic. Enormous fleets of motor vehicles are coming back from France and are going to be let loose on the country here. They will be sold to commercial men, to farmers and so on, and they will be utilised. An hon. Member spoke just now in regard to the question of housing. Nothing will ease the housing question more than great fleets of lorries to take bricks, cement, and other building materials out to districts where houses are going to be built. Nothing is easier or better for the transport of people than the motor omnibus. It is far better than the light railway. My right hon. Friend the Minister-designate mentioned in his speech that the light railway cannot be moved. Now, motor transport can be moved here, there, and everywhere. It can be utilised as a seasonal mode of transport, used in the summer and not in the winter, or 	<i>vice versâ</i>. The light railway cannot be so utilised. I do not make any suggestion against the right hon. Gentleman's fairness in this matter. I am sure he would endeavour to be fair. But, having in his mind that £100,000,000 deficit which he has to make up, and having in his mind—I referred to it in the House—the speech in which he said that competition must be got rid of, he is going to have the power to make Regulations with regard to road transport. It would be only human, when he is faced with this enormous deficit, for him to try and see whether he cannot, by some Regulation or other, stop the competition of road transport against the railways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been speaking on behalf of road transport. I now speak on behalf of commerce. It is essential in the interests of trade, commerce, and agriculture, that there should be an alternative mode of transport to the railway, and that the competition, which has hitherto existed, should continue. I ask the Committee to say that the powers which have been exercised by the Road Board should still remain. The Road Board, as everybody knows, has been allowed to become almost dead, but it can be revivified and made almost a new Board. Instead of £2,000,000, it will have £7,000,000 to

spend, and it would be a great factor in the development of the trade, commerce, and agriculture of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that there will be other speakers on the same lines as my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham, but I hope the Committee will forgive me if I say a word or two on this matter, which is very different from the taking over of light railways and tramways. These are much more allied to railways in their character. The local authorities, both in towns and in country districts, have never objected to roads being taken over on proper terms, and the terms which they are anxious to obtain, and which I believe the right hon. Gentleman is to a large extent prepared to give, are these. There is the Consultative Committee, which I am not going to discuss now, but which is in all our minds, and which does react, does repercuss on the issues of this Clause. Apart from that, what we want is a confirmation by the right hon. Gentleman of what he said on the Second Heading, namely, that the administration of the roads would be a separate Department in his great wide-spreading Ministry. We attach great importance to that. We also ask him to say that one of his Parliamentary Under-Secretaries shall have the work of specially dealing with this Department of the Ministry in Parliament. Whether or not it would be possible to have assigned to that Under-Secretary, in addition, some other division of this great administrative Ministry I do not know, but we do attach importance to the recognition of the roads as a separate Department, and we think that one of the Under-Secretaries should be the person to whom we can go, and who, subject to the right hon. Gentleman, will be the Parliamentary mouthpiece of this Department of the Ministry. Thirdly, and this we regard as equally important, we desire some assurance that, either in the Bill or in the way in which financial matters are presented to Parliament. Grants for roads shall be earmarked as such, and that they shall not be diminished, nor for that matter increased, according to the prosperity, great or little, of other enterprises included within the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We admit that there is. a case for supervision of roads as well as other modes of transport. But roads are very different from other modes of transport, and whatever money is raised for them by taxation
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>398</span>
—however largely it may be raised from motor users—there must still be a vast number of people who use the roads freely. Roads are far more universal in their geographical incidence. You could never put roads entirely on the line of railways, canals or tramways. Therefore, local authorities have a special relation to roads. There is not a yard of public road in the country which is not under the management of some local authority, and the problems of road management are the problems in which adjustment between local and other conditions is a most constant, important, and pressing necessity. For these reasons we ask for a separate Parliamentary Under-Secretary — not necessarily, as I have said, devoting the whole of his time to roads, but assigned to them primarily—for the earmarking and application of Government Grants independently of the fortunes of enterprises coming under other parts of the Bill. I believe that if these concessions are possible they will go a long way towards meeting the views of local authorities on this matter. I share the regret of my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham that the Road Board should not be continued. Until within the last few years it was, I think, a body of consultative members representing various interests, but I look to the consultative committees, which we all have in mind, to remedy that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Road Board, of course, must have one directing manager, so to speak, under the Minister. Sir George Gibb has occupied that position, and now it is to be General Maybury. I know that the local authorities have had the greatest confidence in the one, and will have in the other. Therefore, I think that that question is not unsusceptible of adjustment. These are matters to which we attach great importance. I hope the Committee will forgive me for mentioning them at this stage, because a speech from the right hon. Gentleman the Minister-designate would be appreciated by local authorities, and would, I think, smooth the passage of this part of the Bill. If we are satisfied on these lines, and I have every reason to think we shall be, we shall vote for it. But I am none the less grateful to my hon.

Gentleman in charge of this Bill, that there is one point at all events which seems not to have had much consideration, and that is the question of the control which the Minister-designate or his successor will have over the private usage of the roads as apart from the usage of the road in his transport system. To me, that seems a very serious blot on this Section of the Bill. I cannot believe that most of the members of this Committee would consider that Regulations affecting this private usage should be made independent of the official transport system of the country. Up to the present the Regulations have, on the whole, been administered very satisfactorily by those responsible—not, perhaps, to the entire satisfaction of the private user of the road, but, as I say, quite satisfactorily on the whole. In my Constituency the motoring industry is the life-blood of the people, and they regard with real and genuine alarm the introduction of anything that will tend to restrict the free use of private transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMAS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if the Minister will be good enough to give us an indication of his intentions with regard to the use of the roads? At the same time, I do not want him to say anything that may tend to take roads out of the purview of the Bill. I cannot help feeling that we have had an illustration of the shocking memory of the Member for Twickenham. He was a member of a Grand Committee in 1909, when an attempt was being made to form the Road Board. He has told us that the then Prime Minister opposed Mr. John Burns in showing and proving the necessity for one authority, but he forgot—or did not think it wise to remember—what his attitude then was, because, curiously enough, he took the view that it was much better not to have a separate road authority, but to have the roads under the control of the Local Government Board. He has changed and maybe he will give us the explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>An HON. MEMBER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is quite easy!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. THOMAS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very likely, but I wish he had remembered it when he made his remarks. The motorists are an important
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>400</span>
body of the community, it is true, but Parliament has to recognise that the roads are not made for the motorist. They are the arteries of the Kingdom, and some regard must be had for those people who cannot afford to ride motor cars. What about all that cheap motor transport material—"dead scrap iron" as he calls it—which is going to flood the country with competition of the road? Why sell at scrap-iron prices the very things he can use himself? That is our view of the situation. Whilst I agree that provision must be made for local authorities to be considered and consulted, yet I cannot see a Transport Bill such as this with the roads separated from other forms of transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will see, Mr. Chairman, that in the Amendment I have down for consideration presently I am moving to leave out roads, ferries, and bridges, but here I want to say something about the roads and bridges that do not come under the supervision or control of the Road Board. Bridges, ferries, and the like come, I believe, under the control of the Board of Trade. Those of us associated with harbours and docks have always got on very well with that Department, and we ask for no alteration. Are we to understand that the Board of Trade itself has sought this transfer of power to the new authority? Away up on the Tyne we have a very big bridge. There is a railway at the top; foot passengers and vehicular traffic pass underneath. That above, I presume, would be controlled by the Board of Trade; the bridge below by the Road Board. Generally speaking, there is invariably a perfect network of roads across docks, their entrances, and their locks, used not only by the railways but by vehicles of all descriptions and by foot passengers. These are all under the Board of Trade. We want no change of control there. If you are going to transfer all these things from the Board of Trade to the new authority, what is going to become of that elaborate Department which has to deal with these various docks, bridges, and so on? It is a very perfect Department, and I commend it to the right hon. Gentleman to copy. We have no desire to get rid of one bureaucracy for a more stringent one. That would be putting a rope round our necks or taking a leap in the dark. I want to know if the right hon. Gentleman is going to take over the powers now exercised by the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is perfectly true that in the Ministry there will be a Department whose duties will include the roads, and it is equally true that one of the Under-Secretaries, in addition to other duties, will be the special spokesman and attend to matters specially connected with the roads. With regard to funds, all this Clause seeks to do is to transfer from the Road Board all the duties and responsibilities with regard to roads. There could be no change in the use of the money provided by the Development Act. Clause 5 of the Bill gives power to make advances for construction and improvement. Therefore these interests would be safeguarded in conjunction with the general interests. My hon. Friend the Member for one of the Divisions of Newcastle said the job would be shortened if they knew where they stood with regard to the advisory committee which might be set up. Very well, I can state in perfectly general terms what it is that the Government—and I say advisedly the Government—would be prepared to do in this matter. Certain words I suggested this morning do not carry out what I had in mind. The Government are perfectly willing that it should be compulsory in the Bill to have advisory committees. They are equally willing that these committees should consist of gentlemen chosen by the interests concerned to represent those particular interests. This they are perfectly willing to put in the Bill, and a proposal will</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

concerned, but there are other powers under the Home Office, and I want to know whether those powers are going to be transferred. They are not mentioned in the Return to the House of Commons of the principal powers and functions which may be transferred to the Minister of Ways and Communications. There are a large number of powers now vested in the Home Office relating to vehicular traffic, licensing, etc., control of which is exercised by the police in this Metropolis, and I want to ask the Minister whether it is the intention also to transfer to the right hon. Gentleman all those powers which are now vested in the Home Office for the regulation of traffic. I formally move the Amendment in order to ascertain that.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been very carefully through the Bill and I see that under Clause 2 vehicles and traffic are to be taken over where the Government has control at the present time. Would the right hon. Gentleman give me a definition of the word "vehicle"? Speaking from memory a vehicle is something which has four wheels or more. What I want to know is, how far does this carry us. I see nothing with regard to motor omnibuses, motor cabs, hansom cabs, and such like, and I do think, at all events, we should know what powers the Government are going to take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Committee might have taken much more interest in this very important subject. As to whether the Minister is to licence London cabmen or whether the police are, I do not think the Minister will worry his head much about the London cabmen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question is whether the Home Secretary will maintain control of the traffic of London or hand it over to the Minister-designate. It will give my right hon. Friend control over the police work of London. Are they going to hand over the police portion of powers to the Minister-designate, or is the Home Secretary going to keep them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The police will keep the ordinary licensing, the passing of omnibuses, and so on. If it is a case of a road running from London right out, the Minister will take charge of that road, but he certainly will not take charge of the police out of the hands of the Home Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>An HON. MEMBER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the police have the same control within the Metropolitan Police area fifteen miles from Charing Cross?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing in the Bill which says that if the route is some distance outside that then it will come under the Ministry of Ways and Communications, but if it runs within a certain given area, not defined, then it is under the Home Office. We should know where we are. If there is going to be dual control, let us know it now. We have heard up to the present time, in order that there may be no friction, that everything is to be developed under one hat. It is necessary for the regulation of traffic that it should all come under one control. Let us know whether the Home Office is going to give up control, or how far it is going.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We ought to have a clear answer. It is a matter which particularly affects London. If we want to run a tramway line we have to come to Parliament. We have to go through all the regulations of obtaining a Private Bill through the House of Commons Committees in order to lay down & tramway down a particular road or through a particular district. So far as I understand, as regards motor omnibuses—of which London and the surrounding districts have a great many—I do not believe there is any regulation as to where these buses shall run. It is true that the buses licensed by the police under the direction of the Home Office run on certain routes, but you will find that they also run on any road they like. There are roads in the London suburbs built for purely residential purposes, with a good class of property in them and rates highly assessed, and these have been turned into motor-bus roads. People who live in these roads have no kind of protection against the roads being used for that purpose. If the new Ministry proposes to take over the control of motor traffic all over the country, I think that we who represent London are entitled to a statement as to how they propose to deal with London. It is an urgent matter as far as London is concerned. A good many buses run on very long routes outside the immediate Local Government area of London. They go into other county areas, and I believe exactly the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>405</span>
same procedure arises. I think you will find that a good many county councils and road authorities outside London have complained about motor omnibus companies suddenly turning a road into a main motor-bus route and cutting up roads towards the maintenance of which they do not contribute anything. This is a matter now under the Home Secretary. The Clause which we are dealing with, as I understand it, only transfers the powers to the new Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. LOWE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think these words are very wide—the words "vehicles and traffic thereon," showing what is to be transferred to the new Ministry from the Local Government Board. In the White Paper which has been mentioned reference is made to the powers of various Departments, but it only says "the control exercised by the Local Government Board" and there is nothing with reference to the powers of the Home Office or of the Commissioner of Police. As has just been said, they might well take power to deal with the whole of the London traffic. I think these words require reconsideration, and that something more definite should be inserted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain R. GUINNESS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me important and desirable that if the powers of the Home Office were transferred to the new Ministry they should also take charge of fares and charges in and around London, so as not to allow one to be robbed by a cabman because he went outside the Metropolitan area. With that object it would be well to strengthen these words. I think it is an important point that these fares should be dealt with by a co-ordinated authority covering the whole country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. ADKINS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The control of the speed limit involves judicial proceedings. I am not against this proposal, but I simply want to ask a question. In dealing with these vehicles you have an important problem, and the same applies to public order and safety, and it should be dealt with only by a judicial or semi-judicial authority. I ask the right hon. Gentleman the Home Secretary if he will make it clear to the Committee what is the method by which they propose to deal with such problems of public safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NEAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These discussions have proceeded on the basis that these powers will automatically, on the Bill becoming law,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>406</span>
be transferred to the Minister of the new Department. But that is not so. Clause 2 is intended to carry out Clause 1, and says:
	<br><q><p>"It shall be the duty of the Minister to carry out the purposes aforesaid and there shall, as from such date or dates as His Majesty in Council may by Order determine, be transferred to the Minister the powers and duties of other Government Departments."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only the date is left to be filled in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NEAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing to say that an Order in Council shall be made at a specific time or that there shall be a definite Order in Council to defer or transfer the powers. The first provision covers the power to transfer these duties, and then it is provided in Clause 2, Sub-section (2), of the Bill, that
	<br><q><p>"His Majesty in Council may by Order except from such transfer any particular powers or duties or provide for the exercise or performance of any power or duty so excepted by the Minister concurrently or in consultation with or at the instance of the Government Department concerned or by the Government Department concerned concurrently or in consultation with the Minister."</p></q>
It seems to me that in the discussion due effect has not been given to these provisions, and that it is really intended that there shall be no transfer until the Order in Council has been made. The Order in Council must be completed in the way set out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or it may never be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NEAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes; it may never be made, and the effect upon this problem of vehicles and public safety and the like would be subject to these Orders in Council made from time to time. I am not at this stage expressing an opinion upon whether these powers should be transferred or not. I am trying to interpret what is the intention of the Government as expressed in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend who has just spoken has pointed out exactly how the Bill would proceed. It provides that certain powers may be taken over, but the Government does not say that all these powers will be taken over, nor need be taken at the same time. While power is given to take them, it is quite clear from the Bill that only a certain number will or may be taken as it is found advisable or necessary to do so. Safety and traffic
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>407</span>
arrangements do not proceed at once from one Department to another. The Ministry may take over first one power of the Home Office or take over powers dealing with particular subjects or with particular districts. It may be found to be necessary to deal with fares in order to make things work smoothly. The Minister may be advised to transfer from the Home Office powers like these which are found necessary. If this is found necessary it can be done, but there must be an Order in Council, and only such powers will be transferred as are necessary for the object in view. It is impossible to give details of the powers that might have to be taken over, but, speaking generally, they will be the powers set out in the White Paper. These represent the intentions and views of the Ministry at the present time as to the powers which may be taken over at first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. KILEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that there was a Select Committee which sat in 1911 and inquired into questions affecting motor traffic, and that it recommended that the powers exercised by the Home Office regarding such traffic should be transferred to the Board of Trade? Will that affect his conclusions in the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes; I was quite aware of that recommendation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, to leave out paragraph (	<i>f</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This paragraph deals with harbours, docks, and piers. If I thought that this Amendment stood on all fours with the one dealing with waterways I would not have taken up any time in proposing it. But it deals with quite a different set of matters. I am sure that the Home Secretary was quite right when he pointed out that Clause 2 dealt with the transfer of powers from one Department to another, and not with cases of taking over control by means of new powers. It is rather difficult for a new Member, inexperienced in Parliamentary work, to understand the way in which these Bills are drawn. We might have had to postpone the question of harbours and docks until we came to Clause 3, Sub-section (	<i>d</i>), which also deals with the same matter. The object here is to get the docks under the control of the new Department. The docks and harbours
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>408</span>
have been under the Board of Trade, and it is now desired to remove them. We have always got on very well with the docks and with the other forms of inland navigation. They also deal with the questions of dredging and the sending of the dredgers out to sea, and a great many things of that kind which really bring them into contact with shipping. We do not desire to see the docks removed from the Board of Trade. If the Government are going to carry out their plans, no doubt they think it may be necessary to transfer the docks, but it is entirely a different matter when they come to deal with things so closely affecting shipping, and to bring them under their jurisdiction. I do not think the question of the docks will be in any way prejudiced because we find reasons against taking them over at the present stage. The statement was made on the Second Reading that the railway docks were half of the clocks and the private docks were the other half. That may be the case with regard to the water area of the docks, but it is not correct with regard to the whole of the docks and quayage. Many of the docks have comparatively very little water area because the managers of docks endeavour to provide as many facilities for ships dealing with cargoes, such as sheds and other accommodation. Further, it is not correct to say that half the traffic of the docks is carried on railways after It comes in by ships. Before the war 75 per cent. of the traffic did not go by rail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite an understandable thing that the Minister-designate should wish to get control of these docks. I know that the object is to carry out a great transport scheme and to make use of one dock or another, not treating them on a parochial or local system. That is the object of taking powers to control the docks, but he has not asked for control over the ships or over the cargoes which come into the docks. I know what I am speaking about. These vessels which bring the cargoes have many different chances of taking the cargo to any dock they like. Supposing the right hon. Gentleman said that it was part of his plan that a cargo should be taken to this place or that, I do not think that, even though he might think it was in the national interest, as it was during the War, he would be able to carry it out. You cannot send my ships to any port that I do not want them to go to, and their cargo cannot be ordered to be landed at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>409</span>
any port you desire. Therefore if you Are going to control the docks you must attempt to rope in control of the ships and the cargoes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some think that that is the ulterior motive of the Bill. I am not going to say whether I believe that or not. At any rate, the point of this Amendment is simply that we do not want the docks—I speak with not only a very large experience of dock management, but a lifelong experience of shipping—to be put under the same control as the railways and roads and canals. We want them to be kept in the hands of the Board of Trade, which has to do with our great industry of shipping and which is intimately mixed up with dock management. It is very difficult to discuss this matter in its larger aspect; in fact, we are confined just now to the one question whether the docks are to be transferred from one State Department to another. If one could state the whole dock case now—which, I am afraid, I shall not he allowed to do—I think a different complexion would be put upon the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. PEARCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. In discussing this paragraph are the speakers obliged to keep simply to the point of transfer from the Board of Trade to the new authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I find any Member out of order I will tell him so. Until then, I do not think I ought to be asked to say just where I stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am entirely under your ruling, Sir. I think another hon. Member was prevented similarly from going into the question of light railways. If you rule that I must keep to the transfer I will do so. I have said nearly all that I have to say, but if I may go into the question of why the docks should be excluded I will do so. I think that from that one point of view alone, if from almost no other, I should have been bound to speak on this dock question. I am perfectly convinced that neither the House nor the Committee quite realise "the intricacies of dock management and of the dock system as connected with the great transport system of the country. I am not theorising about this. I have spent over thirty years in intimate connection with dock management, and not only with dock management in the Port of Glasgow. I have visited and had business connections with nearly every dock company in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>410</span>
the United Kingdom, and a great many docks on the Continent and in far distant parts of the world. And who is better able to know whether docks are doing their duty, and what they ought to do when they are doing their duty, than the shipowner? A most extraordinary statement was made by the Home Secretary. He said that it was not for the docks—at any rate, it was not one of their chief functions—to see that ships were quickly turned round. I should say that the port which gets the notoriety of not turning its ships round quickly has got to pay for it. Take the port of Rouen. The right hon. Gentleman will probably know something about that during the War. Why has Rouen for years and years had to pay from 2s. 6d. to 5s. a ton more than any other port? Simply because it did not give dispatch. Vessels had to wait, and you could get no reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to that very same point the Minister-designate said that he found when he got to France that the whole of the dock system was in a chaotic state, and he had to take a grip of it. Why was that? That is one of the best examples we can have for our objections to this Bill. It was because they were Government docks, not private docks. Did he find a similar state of matters when he had to do with the docks in this country? I venture to say he did not. I am going to use a very valuable instrument that has been put into my hands all unexpectedly. The Postmaster-General intervened in the Debate on the Second Reading, and I am going to give from the Report of his Commission in regard to dock management during the War some examples of what we believe and fear will happen if docks are put under a Ministry here, however able it may be, and however experienced it may be in the management of railways or other similar modes of transport. I am going to show the Committee the very things that are likely to happen, and the danger of them if they do happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would only remind the hon. Member that this is a Committee, and would ask him if he will, so far as possible, avoid making Second Reading speeches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When as a new Member I spoke on the Second Reading hon. Members who followed me said that my speech was a Committee speech. Apparently, owing to my inexperience, that

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>411</span>
speech contained much that I ought to have said here, and 	<i>vice versâ</i>. The Postmaster-General's strictures in the Report to which I have referred, and upon which, for aught that I know, a good deal of this new project may have been founded, appear very damaging. If they had been true, or anywhere near the truth, I would not blame the right hon. Gentleman for having thought it high time to take command of these docks and get them under proper unified control. I feel just a little difficulty in proceeding, as it is now so near six o'clock, and would much rather have appealed to you, Mr. Chairman, to allow me to begin tomorrow morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If you stop now [	<i>5.50 p.m</i>.] you cannot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>HON. MEMBERS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Go on!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite with the Government in wishing to see an improvement in the great transport system of this country. I quite agree with the right hon. Gentleman that there has been no uniformity of policy in the past, but, notwithstanding that, the very things he is going to rope in now have contributed more to the good management and the success of the transport of this country than any other items. But is what he has in view going to be attained by this measure? I am bound to say that, if I thought it was, any personal interest of mine, or the fact that I have had intimate connection with the docks, would have gone for nothing, and all my personal feelings as a shipowner would have gone for nothing, if I had really believed that the new Ministry is going to improve things by taking control over these docks. I am going to give the reason for my doubts. If you do, in the process of this new control, some injury to any one of these great private docks, it may never be possible afterwards to put it right, because the business of this country has found its habitats in those various ports and districts where these harbours are. We are bound to take a local view when we are constructing our docks, and to cater for the trade that we know is in our district or that we hope to make in our district. But it is nonsense to say that because we do that we are not taking a wider view. Our ships sail the seas and visit every port, and those who are on these dock boards have a knowledge of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>412</span>
shipping and bring all their experience to bear upon the docks of which they are managers and trustees. How are you going to regulate the traffic of these docks if you have not command of shipping and of the goods that are brought in? I heard the right hon. Gentleman say to-day that it might be a. part of his scheme to bring the rails right down to the quay-side. With regard to some harbours, I say Yes. These harbours, no doubt, have the rails down to the quay-side if they find them necessary. But in the port of which I have the best knowledge the great majority of the traffic is done by carting. It has nothing to do with railways. A great deal is coastwise cargo lifted from one shed, transported to another, and sent away by steamer without seeing the railway at. all. We have regulated ourselves accordingly. But the Postmaster-General's Commission comes down behind our backs. We are not told it was coming and had no opportunity of explaining our system to those who came, but because they believed we were not up to date they sent down this Commission. In one part of the Report complaint is made that a great many of the loading and discharging berths have no rails. We could have told them, if they had come and asked us, why we had no rails. These places where they were wanting rails are really the public street? of Glasgow—coasting and cartage traffic berthage. All down there you cannot put rails because the corporation of the city and the inhabitants would not allow railway wagons to be run on them. Then, with regard to the question of lighting, which I think the right hon. Gentleman, the Home Secretary, mentioned in his speech, they came down and found that the sheds were not very well lighted. We admit that, but why was it? Firstly, under Defence of the Realm Act the police would not allow us to light up the sheds, and we had to do with the very minimum of light. In the second place, we used incandescent gas lights and not electric light, whereas the Postmaster-General's Committee insisted or recommended that we should put in electric light. Why did we not use electric light? Because the City of Glasgow found, and we found, that the lighting of the streets was much better done by incandescent gas lights, and these did not cause so many shadows in the sheds. These matters were all well known to us, but this Committee sent in a recommendation to the Government that they ought to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1919-1919V002P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>413</span>
take over the management of the Port and Harbour of Glasgow, because the docks were not efficiently managed, not efficiently lighted, and had not sufficient rails, or that, where there were rails, they were not used. What more can a dock company do than put the rails down and give the shippers and customers the opportunity of using them? And why have they not used them? They are used, to some extent, but not to the greatest possible extent, simply because the receivers and shippers of cargo will not use the rails, and no wonder! Take the fruit trade, in regard to which Glasgow is a very large entrepot. We
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>414</span>
put rails down at the back of a shed where fruit was landed, but the dealers said, "We are not going to have that; we are going to lift the stuff from the shed, sort it, and take it into the saleroom; if we take it by rail we have to cart it from the railway depot." That is not the fault of the dock company. I say the Government, during the whole period of the War, when we were under great stress which we should not have in times of peace, have never threatened to commandeer us, except in the case of the Report of that Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
