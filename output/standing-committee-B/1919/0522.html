	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I desire, Sir, to bring under your notice a point of Order. Yesterday evening about six o'clock you ruled out of order a proposed new Clause standing in my name (	<i>Minister to Indemnify Owners of Undertaking</i>). You did so on the ground that it would come under the compensation Clause which is to come before us to-day, but I think in so deciding you were a little misled. What I had in mind particularly was the question of dock authorities, and where a Minister had given some order that was going to be injurious, not perhaps in a monetary sense but which, at any rate, was going to hurt the undertaking, and I desire to provide that in some form or another there should be some appeal. We were told by the Home (Secretary that that was provided for by Section 30 of the Act of 1888, but I think I have convinced the Government that it is not so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member's point is that he ought to have been allowed yesterday to move this proposed new Clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and I want to do so before we come to the end of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think if the hon. Member will look carefully through the proposed compensation Clause he will see that his point is covered by Sub-section (6) of that Clause, but I will look into the matter again. I have not time to do so now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>NEW CLAUSE.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(Claims against and by the Minister in Respect of Exercise of Powers.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>(1) Where at the end of the period of possession by the Government of any undertaking the value thereof on a revenue-earning basis has been reduced or enhanced as compared with the value at the commencement of such period, or where during that period the income thereof has been reduced or enhanced after taking into account in each case capital expenditure by the owners of the undertaking on any works brought into use in the interval, then, if and so far as such reduction or enhancement is due
	<span class='label label-info column'>1116</span>
to the exercise by the Minister during that period upon the undertaking in question of the powers under Section 3 of this Act (including such powers as have been hitherto exercised by the Board of Trade as mentioned in paragraph (1) (	<i>a</i>) of that Section) the owners of the undertaking shall, unless such reduction or enhancement is otherwise provided for by the payments mentioned in paragraph (1) (	<i>a</i>) of that Section, be entitled to be recouped or liable to pay the amount by which that value has been so reduced or enhanced, and if any question arises as to such amount or the liability to pay the same, or otherwise with respect to the financial relations between the Minister and any person affected by the exercise by the Minister of any of his powers under the said Section, the question shall be determined by the Railway and Canal Commission having regard to all the circumstances of the case.</p>
	<p>Provided that—
	<ol>
	<li>no claim in respect of any loss alleged to be due to any direction issued by the Minister shall be entertained if the direction was issued with the concurrence of the owners of the undertaking; and</li>
	<li>if, whilst an undertaking of which possession has been taken before the passing of this Act remains in the possession of the Government, the State is authorised by Parliament to acquire the undertaking, nothing in this Sub-section restricting claims for enhancement attributable to the exercise by the Minister of such powers as aforesaid to cases where the value of the under-taking has been enhanced as compared with the value thereof at the commencement of the period of possession shall be held to affect, one way or the other, any question as to the principle on which the price to be paid on such acquisition is to be based.</li></ol>
	<ol>
	<li>Without prejudice to any other form of payment or satisfaction, the Treasury, on the recommendation of the Minister, may, as or as part of the consideration for exercising any powers of control under the said Section, guarantee the payment of any dividends on any stock or other securities issued by the owners of an undertaking up to such amount as may be agreed, or the payment of any working expenses of the undertaking, and any sums required to fulfil any such guarantee shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament.</li>
	<li>Wherever the Minister has expended any sum in the capital improvement of any undertaking the owners of the undertaking shall be liable to pay to the Minister the unexhausted value of such expenditure at the end of the before-mentioned period, if and so far as such expenditure is not covered by the payments to be made by the owners under the preceding provisions of this Section and that value shall, in default of agreement, be determined by the Railway and Canal Commission.</li>
	<li>The owners of the undertaking may satisfy any payment due from them under this Section by creating a charge in favour of the Treasury upon the undertaking to such amount and in such form and with such priority as may be agreed or, in case of difference, may be settled by the Railway and Canal Commission, who shall have due regard to the rights and

	<span class='label label-info column'>1117</span>
interests of all parties concerned, but the charge so created shall in no case take priority to any loan capital raised by loan on debenture stock issued by the owners of the undertaking.</li>
	<li>Any claim by a railway company against the Government for compensation in respect of the exercise by the Board of Trade of any powers over or in respect of the undertaking in pursuance of Section sixteen of the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, or with the consent of the railway company, or otherwise, may be determined by the Railway and Canal Commission in like manner as if it were a claim arising under this Section, and the Minister was the person liable to satisfy the claim.</li>
	<li>The Minister shall indemnify, and keep indemnified, the owners of any undertaking of which possession has been retained or taken against all actions, claims, and demands made in respect of loss or injury alleged to be caused by the carrying out of any directions given by the Minister under Section three of this Act.</li></ol></p>
	<p>Provided that where the loss or injury is due to the breach of any contractual obligation the Minister shall not be liable under this provision unless before carrying out the directions the owners of the undertaking have given written notice to the Minister of the existence of the obligation.—[	<i>Mr. Shortt</i>.]</p>
	<p>Brought up, and read the first time.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The SECRETARY of STATE for the HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. Shortt)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Clause be read a second time."</p></blockquote>
I think it would be convenient if the Committee agreed that we should confine ourselves to-day to this Clause. We are not in a position to go on with the Wagons Clause (	<i>Powers as to Railway Wagons</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the proposed new Clause standing in the name of the hon. Member for Batley and Morley (Mr. France) (	<i>Roads Department and Under Secretary</i>), so as to have only the Wagons Clause left next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, Sir. This is a Clause which is intended to secure that there should be absolute fairness of dealing between the Ministry and any undertaking which is affected by the exercise by the Minister of his powers under the Act. The proposal is that there should be as far as possible uniformity in dealing with any claims by owners of undertakings, and for that purpose for all claims the same tribunal is provided, namely, the tribunal of the Railway and Canal Commission. Claims, of course, can arise in various ways. A claim may arise in respect of something done by the Board of Trade under their powers previous to the creation of the Ministry
	<span class='label label-info column'>1118</span>
and the taking over by the Ministry of the powers of the Board of Trade. It might equally be a claim arising under the Act of 1871, or under the Railway Agreement if it is a railway company, or in any other way. Therefore it is provided that, no matter how the claim may arise, if there is a dispute as to the amount or any other circumstances, then the Railway and Canal Commission shall be the tribunal to deal with the matter. The Clause not only provides for the payment of compensation to an undertaking which is depreciated, but it also provides for the payment by an undertaking of enhancement of the value. If the Ministry expends money upon an undertaking, and that results in the enhanced value of that undertaking, then the undertaking will be liable to pay the Ministry the equivalent of compensation if there had been instead of enhancement, depreciation in. value. It is proposed that the value should be based upon the revenue-earning basis. It seems to me, and I mention this because there is an Amendment to leave out the words "on a revenue-earning basis," that the only way in which you can ascertain the value of such undertakings as those which are dealt with under this Act, is on the revenue-earning basis. Take a dock or railway, and if you can imagine such a thing as the purchaser of a railway in the ordinary sense, he would calculate what is the revenue which that undertaking will earn, and the same with a dock. The only value of a dock is its revenue-earning capacity. Nobody would buy it for any other purpose. No company would acquire the dock or a railway or a siding for any other purpose than in a revenue-earning capacity. There are two provisos. The first proviso is with regard to claims. It is provided that
	<br><blockquote><p>"no claim in respect of any loss alleged to be due to any direction issued by the Minister shall be entertained if the direction was issued with the concurrence of the owners of the undertaking."</p></blockquote>
What is intended there is this: to meet the case where an undertaking sees that some alteration, some improvement, some extension, or whatever it may be, is for the benefit of the undertaking. They consider it is so, but they are not in a position to carry it out themselves. They cannot, perhaps, acquire the land or have not got the money available. Therefore they come to an agreement with the Ministry. The Minister would say, "This would be a good
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0564">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1119</span>
thing for you to do." They might say, "Yes, it would, but we cannot do it," and the Minister might say, "Very well, if I take control, and give you the power, you will then be able to do what you could not otherwise do. You can acquire the land, and we can advance the money, and so you can carry out the undertaking." In a case of that kind, it is only fair that the chances, whether for good or evil, should be undertaken by the undertaking itself. If there is a profit, they will acquire it, but if there is a loss, they must bear it. It is not intended to mean by concurrence that the mere obedience of a direction or the carrying out of the direction of the Minister is in itself concurrence. There can be no damage by providing that what is fair should be done. Suppose an undertaking were ordered by the Minister to do something, but the directors of the undertaking said, "It is a bad thing, but we will carry it out, if you insist," that would not be concurrence. They would concur in the sense that they carried out the direction, but it would not be concurrence as meant here. Therefore, in that case there would not be concurrence, although the direction of the Minister was loyally carried out by the owners of the undertaking, and if there was a loss the owners would in that case be entitled to be recouped under the provisions of this Clause. The next proviso is for the protection of the Treasury, and it provides that supposing an undertaking is being acquired by the State, and something which the Minister has done has enhanced the value of that undertaking, the owners of the undertaking are not to be entitled to go to the Tribunal and say, "We do not care who did this; it is perfectly true that the Minister did it, but here is our undertaking with that done, here is its value with the extension or improvement or whatever it might be, and we claim as of right that it should be valued on that basis." That would be manifestly unfair, and therefore the provision is that if the Minister has done something which has enhanced the value of the undertaking and the undertaking is about to be purchased by the State and valued by the Tribunal, they are not as of right to claim the value of the improvements carried out by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander DAWES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can he give us an illustration of what he means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1120</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me take the case of a dock, and a considerable amount of money, we will say, has been spent in deepening the dock, widening the entrance, or extending it, and making it a dock which could take much larger vessels. It would have a much larger value than if it had been left the smaller dock it originally was. That would be work carried out under the direction of the Minister and at the expense of the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander DAWES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the passing of this Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could not be done by, the Minister before the passing of this Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander DAWES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Sub-section says so, that is all. It says, "If, whilst an undertaking of which possession has been taken before the passing of this Act—"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It goes on to say "remains in the possession of the Government, the State is authorised by Parliament to acquire the undertaking," but it must be after the passing of this Act. If the Government have done the work, or rather, if the taxpayers have done the work, the improvement is not of right to be claimed as part of the value. Equally with the electrification of the railway, supposing the State had paid for electrifying a line or carrying out an improvement which gave it an added value. But it might very well be that the owners of the undertaking would say, "It is true that the Minister has done this work, but it was clearly work which any sensible and far-seeing directors would have carried out themselves, and we should have done it in any event." They would then be entitled to say, "When you are valuing this undertaking you must value it on the basis that it was capable of that improvement, which would in fact have been carried out and which would, of course, add to its value." Therefore, the words are to the effect that that sort of work is not to affect one way or the other any question as to the principle on which the price to be paid on such acquisition is to be based. It is not to be treated as of right to give a claim for an additional value, and equally, because the Minister happened to carry out certain works which the directors would themselves have done if they had been left alone, that they are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1121</span>
not to have the value of the undertaking as capable of such improvement. There are certain other provisions with regard to the method of guarantee and so on, and indemnification against any claims and demands, and then the last of all is that, supposing a direction of a Minister causes some breach of contract, there is to be no claim for that unless notice is given. That is manifestly fair, because the Minister might very well give a direction which would be nothing but advantageous but for the contract, and in entire ignorance of the existence of the contract, and therefore if the undertaking is to make any claim in respect to a contract, a breach of which is caused owing to the direction of the Minister, they must give the Minister notice that that contract exists. If the Minister with the knowledge of the contract gives the direction then he would be liable to indemnify for any loss caused owing to breach of that contract.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that under Subsection (6)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I think that is the explanation of the Clause. We intended it to provide that there should be absolute fair play with regard to all the owners of undertakings, and we shall, of course, welcome any suggestion which makes that more certain, because that is the object which we have in view. I think, so far as we are able to provide it, this Clause does that, and therefore I would ask the Committee to give it a Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the view of my right hon. Friend that he has put a Clause down which is really intended to meet the very grave possibilities of danger under this Bill. As the Committee knows, I have felt it my duty at times to oppose portions of the Bill because it gives enormous powers to one individual Minister to deal either for good or for evil with the great trading interests of this country, and particularly with the transport interests. I think there are one or two points in the Clause which might be improved, but I confess the right hon. Gentleman's speech has been so conciliatory that I hope we may be able to get the Clause through quickly. I would like to ask him if he will further consider the question of the revenue-earning basis. It is a little difficult to understand what he means by the value of an undertaking being on a revenue-earning basis. I can quite conceive it possible
	<span class='label label-info column'>1122</span>
that the Minister might spend a large sum of money on a railway or a dock which did not increase the revenue-earning basis of the undertaking, and therefore though it might improve it in certain respects, it might not increase the revenue earning basis, and it would be wrong in that respect to claim an enhancement and repay to the Minister what he had spent on that improvement. But supposing under the provisions of Clause 3 of the Bill he temporarily alters the rates or tolls of a railway or a dock. He might say, in fact the right hon. Gentleman has frankly said to us, that he is bound to put up rates and tolls because he must get more revenue, and supposing he does that and by so doing during that period of two years he largely increases the revenue-earning basis of the undertaking. At the end of that time he gives back the undertaking—I am assuming that nationalisation does not come off—to the original owners, with the revenue-earning basis, not by any expenditure of money, but by the action of the Minister under the Act, considerably increased, but 	<i>non constat</i> at all that those rates are going to remain. You hand back your undertaking with the rates by the authority of the Government largely increased, and therefore the revenue-earning basis largely increased. But when it goes back to the undertaking bang go those increased rates, either because Parliament does not authorise them to be kept on or the undertaking itself finds that in the interests of the trading community it cannot keep them on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then there would be no increased value, and nothing would happen, and during the two years the increased value would all go to the Government. Everything during the two years, certainly with regard to railways, over the net receipts of 1913, based on the old rates, goes to the Government, and therefore during the two years any advantage they may have maintained by putting up the rates goes to the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about docks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was speaking of railways. I do not profess to be an authority either on railways or on docks, but certainly not on docks in the presence of my hon. Friend. But when the railways go back, if the rates go down, there is no increased value, and there is nothing to buy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0566">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1123</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not profess to be a specialist, but an ordinary Member of Parliament, who is trying to see that the Bill is put through in a form which is fair to all these great undertakings which come to us for protection. I venture with the greatest humility to suggest that my right hon. Friend is not quite accurate in that respect. It is true that if on 21st December, 1921, the things are handed back and the increased rates are cut off with a knife and go back at that moment to the rates they were before, there is no increased revenue-earning capacity, but that would not be the case. The rates will not be cut off with a knife the very second the undertaking is handed back. There will be a period, shall I say, of squabbles and differences of opinion between the undertakings and Parliament, and between the undertakings and the commerce of this country as to how far they can keep up those high rates which the right hon. Gentleman has put up during his period of autocracy. That is what I want to get at. I am quite willing to leave the revenue-earning basis in the Bill as it is drawn up, but there must be some provision that if the increase of the basis is solely on account of the arbitrary action under the Bill of the Minister in raising the rates, unless those are continued for a period there is obviously no increase in the revenue-earning basis. The only other point I will mention now is in regard to the last Clause, that the Minister is not to be liable in regard to breach of contractual undertakings unless the undertaking gives notice to the Minister of the particular contract. Let us assume that there is some contract between an undertaking and a builder to build certain things. The Minister knows nothing of it, and there is a breach of that contract. I have provided for an Amendment, which I think must come in, that if that breach takes place nothing in this Act shall prevent the contractor having his claim for damages against the undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NEAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Minister may be congratulated on a very genuine effort to meet the case of compensation by this new Clause. It contains an old principle, now called "enhancement," which many of us knew under the old name of "betterment," and I am sure that is not seriously challenged. My object in rising is to call
	<span class='label label-info column'>1124</span>
attention to Sub-section (4), which, I think, will require some consideration before it can possibly be introduced in anything like its present form—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The owners of the undertaking may satisfy any payment due from them under this Section by creating a charge in favour of the Treasury."</p></blockquote>
This Clause is to discharge a liability by creating a mortgage for it, and I suggest that that will not do. The object, I take it, is that the railway company or other undertaking concerned shall not be called upon at once to make a cash payment which might be extremely inconvenient, if not impossible, and that they may have the privilege of making that payment in some deferred form, the Government being secured in the meantime by a charge upon the undertaking. But it seems to me that the Sub-section in its present form is altogether too loose and vague, and wants complete re-drafting, showing the lines upon which the railway company or other undertakings are to have this privilege granted to them. I do not think the remaining words of the Clause carry that out. They are
	<br><blockquote><p>"a charge in favour of the Treasury upon the undertaking to such amount and in such form—"</p></blockquote>
that is a mere question of legal form—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and with such priority as may be agreed or, in case of difference, may be settled by the Railway and Canal Commission."</p></blockquote>
I respectfully suggest that this is too vague and uncertain, and that it would be better to have it completely redrafted, perhaps not now, but upon the Report stage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter in which it is almost impossible for the layman to interfere. It is a legal Clause, and I do not profess, as a layman, to understand it, but there is one thing I would like to say, following up what my hon. Friend (Mr. Joynson-Hicks) said, I do not think that revenue is the proper basis. Take the case of docks, which I know best. It may be that the Minister might give way to a clamour that has sometimes arisen that dues on the Clyde are far too cheap in comparison with others, and he may take it into his head to ask us to raise our dues all round, so as to limit the competition which goes on between port and port. That increases our revenue, but see what is the effect of that. At the end of two years our revenue is greatly enhanced, but for years to come the revenue may go on gradually falling off
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0567">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1125</span>
because we have killed off some of the trade of the port. We have had to cheapen the dues in order to attract tonnage, and the tonnage may give preference to other ports because there is not the long distance to steam, so that here we would be paying a considerable enhancement, which, as the years went on, would be not merely money lost, but be a detriment to the trade of the port. That is no imaginary thing. The Minister may say, "I have no intention whatever of raising the dues of that port or any other port," but in his great scheme it may be that such a thing may come to pass, and I do not think it is an undue fear we have. If it is done, I do not think this Clause would act fairly towards us at all. I do not know what remedy can be set up. I have some Amendments down to-day on which I will speak later, but I do take the general objection here that I have stated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question put, and agreed to. Clause read a second time.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1), to leave out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"on a revenue-earning basis."</p></blockquote>
The point here is clearly a good one. The Amendment is probably in one way a method of dealing with the matter, but in regard to the extra revenue arising from these rates, my right hon. Friends must see that something must be provided. All this comes under Clause 3 of the Bill, and is not merely an enhancement by reason of capital expenditure by the Minister, but by anything done under the provisions of Clause 3, and under those provisions all kinds of things might be done which might temporarily increase the revenue-earning basis of the concern. For instance, the Minister might, under Clause 3, Sub-section (1) (c) discontinue the working of a portion of the undertaking temporarily. He might discontinue a branch line which has never paid, and never will pay, but is there for the interest of the community at large. Under his powers he discontinues that badly-paying portion of the undertaking, thereby increasing the revenue-paying value of the whole. When his powers are over, the statutory obligations are re-imposed, and the company has got to re-open that derelict bit of railway, or re-open that badly-paying dock which my right hon. Friend has
	<span class='label label-info column'>1126</span>
closed, and which temporarily has provided an increased revenue-earning capacity. He could then go to the Company and say "You must pay me compensation"—this is a case of an undertaking paying a Minister—"because with my powers I have been able temporarily to increase the revenue-earning capacity of your undertaking by doing so-and-so under Section 3. Now I am handing it back to you, and you must make the best of a bad bargain and carry on your statutory obligations and pay me compensation for increasing your revenue-earning capacity." I think my right hon. Friend will see that something is needed there. I leave it to my right hon. Friends, as the Ministers responsible for the Bill. Having pointed out the difficulty, I say, "Get out of it as best you can."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the fears of my hon. Friend really are groundless. It is not the actual revenue; it is the value on a revenue-earning basis that is being ascertained. If you have done something temporarily which will cease when you give it up, the value on a revenue-earning basis is not enhanced in the least. There may be a question as to the income during the time of compensation, but the value on a revenue-earning basis remains untouched if what is done is purely temporary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point I raised just now of putting up the rates, the railway company or the dock company might not realise within three or four years that they are compelled to reduce their own rates to the old level, or lower, and therefore you have given them back a higher revenue, which they cannot keep because the trade cannot stand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. Friend again has misunderstood me. Let us take the case of raising rates. If raised by the Minister, they go back automatically, when he gives up possession, and at the end of eighteen months, to the old statutory terms, and therefore the value of the concern on a revenue-earning basis is not affected in the least. If you are valuing it on a revenue-earning basis you are valuing it on what it is able to do, and it will only be able to charge the rates for which there is statutory power. If they go to Parliament, as they probably would, to have their statutory powers varied to enable them to charge in perpetuity a higher rate, that would not be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0568">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1127</span>
due to the action of the Minister, and would give no claim at all. The temporary raising of rates may affect the income for a matter of months where compensation is earned, but they do not affect the value on a revenue-earning basis. No arbitrator who is dealing on a revenue-earning basis, and he is told "Now, for the next twelve months you can charge so much, but at the end of that twelve months automatically you have to go back to a lower charge"—no arbitrator, I say, is going to value on that as though the temporary higher charges made were going to be permanent. It makes no difference to the value of the undertaking. It is purely a temporary change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While that might be the case, by your operation during these two years you might have done some injury through the raising of the rates, which injury would go on for some years to come. It would take years to tell what the detriment was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, of course, would be a permanent depreciation, for which compensation would have to be paid. It is difficult to imagine an individual coming to buy a dock, but suppose such a thing could happen, and it was pointed out that something which the Minister had done would affect the revenue-earning power of that dock for the next ten or twenty years, clearly there would be depreciation in value. For that he would get compensation, but you could not possibly increase the value merely because there is power for three or six months more to charge a higher rate. You could not do that. When you remember that it is the value you are getting at on a revenue-earning basis, a mere temporary power to increase the charges cannot give a permanent increased value, whereas, by the action of increasing the rates, you might very well cause an injury which would last for ten, twenty, or fifteen years. That would give a right of claim to the undertaking, even although the temporary power to raise the charges could not give a claim for enhancement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much impressed by the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham. His case may be summarised, I think, quite lucidly by saying that he desires to guard against any enhancement or reduction made, either captiously or intentionally, by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1128</span>
Ministry during a temporary period of occupation. That practically is the case of my hon. Friend in moving this Amendment, and how is it met by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. He states, "Oh, that would clearly be dealt with by the arbitrator, because the arbitrator would have before him the fact that this was only a temporary enhancement or reduction; he would never make the award except upon the basis of recognising the temporary character of the changes and the result of the changes." That, I understand, is the response, in effect, of my right hon. Friend. I do not see any irreconcilable difference between my hon. Friend on this side and my right hon. Friend on the opposite. I think that many cases will be perfectly met, and the rejoinder of my right hon. Friend would be expressed in terms if the following words were added: after the word "period" ["the commencement of such period"],
	<br><blockquote><p>"but not including reduction or enhancement arising from changes of rates imposed by the Minister during such period."</p></blockquote>
I think that would bind the arbitrator to do exactly what my right hon. Friend says he would do. I believe if the arbitrator were so bound, my hon. Friend (Mr. Joynson-Hicks) would be satisfied, and the very reasonable objection which he has advanced would be met, and met exactly in the way suggested by the Home Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WIGNALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I at once confess to an element of doubt in my mind in listening to the speech of the hon. Gentleman opposite (Mr. Joynson-Hicks), and the reply made by the Home Secretary. I am a little bit confused as to the right course to pursue in this matter. One can quite appreciate the difference which has been pointed out. I can quite understand that the Ministry, if they take over certain docks and put in improved machinery, such as better cranes, a few tips, improve the waterway, deepen the sills and the entrance and bring the dock more up to date, will incur an expenditure which, it may be seen and understood, may materially increase the revenue-earning power of a particular dock. On the other hand, I have in my mind's eye docks where, undoubtedly, the Ministry will work one part and close down another. The latter will consequently depreciate and compensation more or less will have to be paid. An increase of dues and charges does not always mean an increase
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0569">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1129</span>
of revenue. It may be a case of very serious loss of earning power. We have to realise that if the Ministry has charge of the railways, docks, roads, trams, and so on, they have not got control of the shipping. The ship owner still has the right to take his ship into the dock which pays the best. However patriotic a man may be in Parliament or on the platform, when it comes to a question of profit he looks round to discharge his cargo in the dock which is the least costly. The competitive system will still remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been dealing in the Joint Committee with the claim for increased revenue for docks in relation to most of the ports of the country. In every case we have heard it said that the power of increasing the charges 50 per cent. or 100 per cent. is wanted, but the directors have been careful to add, "We may not use the power, because we have to compete with neighbouring docks." We must not attach too much importance to the increasing of the dues and charges in the docks unless the Ministry have the shipping. A pound or two in the total charges may divert many a cargo from one port to another. Hon. Members who are shipowners will not dispute what I say. We know of valuable cargoes coming within reach of a certain port, and preparations being made to receive the ship, when an order has been sent out at a few minutes' notice to make for another port. Take for illustration the Bristol Channel. The vessel may have been expected at Swansea. She has been diverted to Cardiff. We who know understand that the cargo could be discharged more cheaply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The illustration given by the hon. Member has nothing to do with the shipowner at all. The diversion was a Government order because of the submarine danger and other war exigencies!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WIGNALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disagree with the hon. Gentleman, but he knows that what I say is correct. I can produce abundance of proof if it were necessary. However, the only point that is necessary to make at this stage is that we must not attach too much importance to increasing the dues and dock charges, because it may not mean at the same time an increase of the revenue-earning power, or help to develop the trade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Home Secretary a question which arises
	<span class='label label-info column'>1130</span>
on this new Clause. I am asking on behalf of London. The Port of London Authorities have control of a series of docks in different parts of the river. I take it it will be quite possible for the Minister under the Bill to take over or close one of our docks. If he does that and only compensates on a revenue-earning basis, that might be very unfair to us in London, because we deal with the docks as a whole, and you may take out one particular dock where the revenue-earning basis is not on a large scale compared with the other docks. May I ask, would the Home Secretary explain what position we should be in London under this Bill if such circumstances arose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a dock were closed as is suggested—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or taken over by the railway—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or handed over to the railway in the same way, and the value of the whole undertaking damaged, compensation would be paid for that. The whole question is one of value. My hon. Friend will realise that we do not want to use the value of the site, the bricks, mortar, stones, and all that kind of thing, but rather to take the value on a revenue-earning basis. Supposing a dock to be valueless to the Port of London Authority—if such a thing could be—and which would be very very valuable to the railway. Supposing it was handed over to the railway to be part of it, then the probability is it would be entirely a question for the tribunal to say the value to the Port Authority. It might be that the arbitrator might say, "It is quite true that the Port Authorities have not been using this dock up to the present, but there is a very good future before it. It would have been very useful to them in a very short period. Therefore their loss on a revenue-earning basis is very considerable." They would be treated accordingly. Clause 3, as my right hon. Friend will recollect, is limited in time. In regard to the words suggested there is great difficulty in filling in a limitation of this sort. It does not in the least meet the case put by my hon. Friend opposite the Member for Dumbarton. He instanced a case where the raising of the rate might very seriously affect the revenue-earning capacity of the docks for a long period. That would be a loss, but if these words were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1131</span>
inserted, the undertaking would not be entitled to claim on account of them. If you are going to eliminate from the purview of the arbitrator or tribunal all the circumstances connected with the rates, tolls, and so on, you must do the same in regard to wages and salary. It might very well be that the Minister would say, "These wages must be raised," and raised they would be. As a result the undertaking must either work at a loss or raise its charges. The Minister might very well say, "Oh, we must have regard to the industry, to our coal exports, or other industry; we cannot raise these rates because it might injure the export trade." You would have there an undertaking forced by the Minister to raise wages, and refused power to raise rates and charges. Manifestly, it would be unfair if the whole of that loss, in a matter done for the good of the industry, were to fall upon the shareholders of the undertaking. If you put in these words of limitation all this sort of case which will arise will be out of the purview of the tribunal, and great injustice would be done. I would ask the Committee not to insert in this Clause any words of limitation which in all probability would work far more hardship than they would secure that justice was done. The spirit is identically the same in the words of the Clause as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has, I think, made a very telling reply. If the detriment occurred, say, in the second year, we would be able to get at it at once, but there may have been some injury caused which will go on for years, and that is one of my difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After what has been said I think the best plan is to withdraw the Amendment, and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will give it reconsideration on Report. My right hon. Friend quoted a case where the Minister gave orders to raise the wages but aid not give orders to raise the rates. Let me quote a case where he gives orders to raise the wages and at the same time to raise the rates to cover the wages. I am sure my hon. Friends on the other side will agree with me that of those two things one is going to be permanent, and if the Minister gives orders to raise the wages that they would be permanent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WIGNALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing surer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1132</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Supposing he gives an order for a permanent increase in wages and only a temporary rise in rates, there is the very serious position as to the revenue-earning capacity that while the expenses will continue permanently the rates may not be able to meet them. While I withdraw this Amendment, I cannot quite see a form of words to remedy what is, I think, a very real difficulty. I would ask leave to withdraw on the understanding that if I can formulate or submit to my right hon. Friend any words which will improve this question on Report I shall be at liberty to move them, but, of course, he is not bound to accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NEAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1), after the word "account" ["taking into account"] to insert the words

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NEAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not desire to make two speeches or say much at all. I think my case requires very few words to support it. The second Amendment which I propose subsequently to move is to add at the end of Sub-section (1) the words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided further, that in any case where the owners of an undertaking are a company which had not previously to the passing of this Act declared a dividend of four per centum out of profits in any one year on its ordinary shares, the company shall not be liable to pay for enhancement of the value of their undertaking under the provisions of this Section, except in so far as the enhancement exceeds the amount of revenue required to pay four per centum on the ordinary share capital of the company issued and paid up at the passing of this Act."</p></blockquote>
So far as the large railway companies are concerned, I understand that the Clause which the Minister has presented meets with a substantial measure of agreement. My observations are in respect of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0572">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1133</span>
smaller railway companies, which are not within any arrangement of that description. I want, if I may, to put this question of principle to the Home Secretary, and I think that he will see that both these Amendments are well founded in principle. The smaller railway companies are nearly all of them companies which have been established without any great hope of profit. Most of them have been established in districts by local capital for the purpose of assisting local industry and serving public purposes, precisely in the same way that the Minister-designate has many times intimated in the House and in Committee that it may be necessary for him to institute small lines of railway to serve agricultural districts and the like, and which lines of railway no one would probably ever embark upon as a speculation, but which are necessary from the point of view of the development of the particular district. I haves in mind a number of lines of that particular kind. What is the almost inevitable fate of a line of that description? Obviously it is too small to stand up alone, and it has very soon to enter upon negotiations with its powerful neighbour, a large railway company with which it connects, and to come under terms of being leased to that company, or worked by them for a percentage of the profits, or in other words, it becomes a mere adjunct to the larger railway. It has never had its chance of developing commercially and the first of these Amendments provides that in taking into account the enhancemnt of such an undertaking the natural growth of traffic shall be considered. I think I may reasonably hope that, so far. the right hon. Gentleman in charge of the Bill and myself are at one, but I suggest that this does not go quite far enough, and the second Amendment may be the means of preventing disputes and litigation. It is quite true that under the Clause I have drawn if there is any question of dispute that may go to the Railway and Canal Commission, but that is a troublesome, tedious, and expensive business. My second Amendment suggests that before any question of enhancement arises these smaller undertakings may look for an extremely moderate return on their ordinary capital and less than the State would give them if they lent the money. I suggest that that return upon the ordinary capital before any question of enhancement arises should be 4 per cent. This has been admitted by the Government in principle in
	<span class='label label-info column'>1134</span>
their arrangements with the principal railway companies. I have here Command Paper 147 dealing with the cost and revenue of the railways in Great Britain and the note at the end of it says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The sum receivable by the railway companies as compensation during the period of Government control is limited to the net receipts of the year 1913, with the addition of 4 per cent. upon capital expenditure brought into use since the beginning of that year."</p></blockquote>
For the purposes of the Amendment in the case of the smaller companies—and here let me say I have no interest in any of them—we are adopting the principle accepted by the Government in reference to the new capital brought into use since 1913 by those companies. We are in this matter very largely in the hands of the Government, and I say quite frankly I am appealing to what I am sure is ever present with them, namely, a sense of what is right and proper and just. We ask that in the case of these smaller companies where the capital has never yet had a chance, although it has served local needs and has been of benefit to the district, that this proposal should be accepted. The small undertaking has been prevented from becoming a commercial success, and I respectfully suggest to the Committee, and particularly to the right hon. Gentleman in charge of the Bill, that this is a very small matter, but that it it might get rid of a good deal of controversy and discussion and possible litigation. I think the smaller companies ought not to have any charge for betterment until their shareholders have had the extremely moderate return which my Amendment would give them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the Amendment we arts actually discussing, we should be prepared to ask the Committee to accept it, but we cannot possibly accept the other Amendment which my hon.

So far as this Amendment is concerned we think it is quite reasonable and we ask the Committee, so far as we can, to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member was only speaking of small railway companies. The Amendment does not exclude the larger ones, and consequently a company like the Great Central Company would come, I think, within his Amendment.

	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1), to leave out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"on any works brought into use in the interval."</p></blockquote>
I desire to know why the expenditure on capital account is only to be taken into consideration if the works are actually brought into use in the interval. This refers to enhancement or detriment, but it would be enhancement in this case. The undertaking is to be valued on a revenue-earning basis as compared with the value at the commencement of such period, or where during that period the income thereof has been reduced or enhanced after taking into account in each case capital expenditure by the owners of the undertaking on any works brought into use in the interval. Suppose the revenue of a company, or of any undertaking, is £100,000 per year, and that at the end of that period it is £106,000 per year, therefore there has been an improvement at the hands of the Ministry, and the Clause says, and quite rightly, that in dealing with the question of enhancement you shall take into consideration any capital expenditure made by the owners on works brought into use. Suppose the owners had made capital expenditure, in dredging a dock or improving a portion of a line of railway or improving a tramway system, and that had cost £100,000, of which the income would be £5,000, but supposing that work has not actually come into operation, surely in arriving at the revenue of the undertaking something ought to be allowed to the company for the capital expenditure they have made. They have had to borrow money and to pay for that money, and I do not see why it should be limited to works actually brought into use in the interval. Suppose dredging goes on in a dock for two years,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1136</span>
and the day before the period is completed the dredging is stopped, the £100,000 has been spent the day before and the works come into operation. Then something is to be allowed, but if the works are not stopped until the day after the two years, although in effect the money has been spent by the owners, there seems to be nothing to be allowed in respect of that expenditure. While the expenditure must be made during the period, I think it clogs the Clause to put in that the works must actually be brought into operation during the tight period of two years. Therefore, I think it should be the capital expenditure during the two years, irrespective of whether the works are actually completed the day before or the day after.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. EVELYN CECIL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think there is very much point in the Amendment, because it seems to me that the words "on any works brought into use in the interval" apply only to works which are done at the request of the Ministry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CECIL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no such limitation here at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CECIL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the works brought into use in the interval would be those which the Ministry had requested. I do not think in practice that it is likely to be otherwise, and if that is so I do not see the object of the Amendment. If I am wrong I confess my observations would fall to the ground, but I do not think that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very complicated Clause, and it requires considerable legal knowledge to interpret it, and therefore if my interpretation is wrong I must make the excuse of a lack of legal knowledge. We will take the case of a dock. The Minister has spent some money on a dock and has increased its revenue-earning capacity. The dock owners have also spent some money on that dock, and have also increased its earning capacity. Then in settling the compensation to be paid for the enhancement, the money which has been spent by the owners and which is of value is deducted. That is to say, the Government do not get paid compensation for an enhancement of value which has been done by the owners. But
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1137</span>
supposing these works have not been brought into use, there is no enhancement of income, and therefore there is nothing to pay. You cannot say that because the Minister has spent £100,000 on a dock which has brought in a revenue of £4,000 a year, and because the company have spent £100,000 on a dock which so far has brought in no revenue at all, something is to be set against the claim of £4,000 a year which the Minister has brought in. That, as I understand it, is the meaning of the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then if that is so, on behalf of the railway companies, who are supposed to be greedy people always looking out for their own interests, we are only trying to do what is fair. We do not want to give away any of our rights, but neither do we want to take what does not belong to us, and we are quite content with the Clause as it stands without the Amendment suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think possibly the misunderstanding has arisen from the fact that the words with which we are dealing, namely, the case of capital expenditure by the owners on any works brought into use in the interval, are dealing with the ascertainment of any loss or enhancement of income during the period. It is all a question of income. It may very well be that a railway company may have spent a million on a dock and the dock has not come into use until this period. It does not matter when the money is spent, but when you are dealing with the question, not of the value of the undertaking on a revenue-earning basis, but with whether the income of the undertaking has been enhanced or depreciated during the period, then you have to take into consideration anything which comes into use during that period, and which therefore affects the income during that period, and these words are dealing with the income of the undertaking. It is the corollary of what we have just passed with regard to capital. Therefore, when the money was spent does not matter, the whole point being that it must have affected the income during the period which is under consideration. Therefore, that is the reason why the words "on any works brought into use in the interval" are put in. It would not affect the income of today that you have got a dock that will have an earning capacity next year or the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1138</span>
year after, but if you are discussing whether to-day's income has fallen or not, it is only right, when you want to know why it has risen, to take into consideration the fact that certain works the cost of which was paid last year come into use this year and affect this year's income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be very stupid, but I do not quite see, if that is the case, if it is only the revenue-earning capacity of the work that has been done, in dredging a dock let us say, why there is any need of any reference to capital expenditure at all. I should say that the introduction of the words "capital expenditure" would be to enable the arbitrator to deduct from the increased revenue so much per cent. on the capital expenditure on work which had been brought into operation during that period, but 	<i>non constat</i> that those works are bringing in additional revenue at 'all. Supposing a million has been spent over a period of years culminating in these two years during which my right hon. Friend is in power. They might not increase the revenue at all, but there has been capital expenditure, which is going to cost the shareholders of the dock a large sum of money in interest which they have got to pay out, and if the Home Secretary is right I do not see the necessity for any reference to capital expenditure at all. The arbitrator is apparently to take into consideration the effect of capital expenditure on work brought into operation during the period. The capital expenditure might not have any real effect on the earning capacity of the dock for the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My Amendment deals with the question of depreciation and the principle on which depreciation is to be based. May I remind the Committee of changes which have been made, from the first Clause as originally introduced, in the Clause which has now been substituted for it. The Committee will remember that in the first sub-Clause the basis of depreciation was not settled. That has now been remedied in this Clause, and the basis of depreciation has been made that of net revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which sub-Clause is the hon. Member referring to?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HAYWARD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am referring to the Clause now under discussion, the Clause dealing with depreciation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But you said the first sub-Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HAYWARD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a substituted Clause for the one which was originally in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to interpose, but the hon. Member is not in order in referring to what is not in the Bill. The real matter before the Committee is this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HAYWARD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only referred to it in order to call the attention of the Committee to what had really happened. I also want to say that it was left quite vague in the original Clause whether the depreciation was to commence as from the passing of this Act or as from the time that the Government first took over the railways in 1914. Both these points have now been made clear in the Clause as drawn. In the first place, depreciation is to be based on the effect on net revenue, and secondly, depreciation is to be calculated, not as from the passing of the Act, but as from the time when the Government took over the railways in 1914. I asked the Home Secretary on the Second Reading of the Bill whether there was any Clause in the Agreement between the railway companies and the Government which
	<span class='label label-info column'>1140</span>
provided for depreciation under that agreement, and the Home Secretary then said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Then I was asked if there were any liability to the railways except that which was created by Mr. Runciman's letter. So far as I remember, my recollection is there is no other liability. If there is, it is some very small detail, but my recollection is, there is no other."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 17th March, 1919; col. 1852, Vol. 113.]</p></blockquote>
And so this is something which is now going to be given to the undertakings and to the railway companies in particular, for something for the period before the passing of this Act, and for the period while the agreement was operating, which is altogether outside the terms of the agreement. Whether that is the case or not, I do want the Committee to realise what is really being done. The position as it now stands under the Clause is that, wherever there is a reduction of net revenue owing to the exercise of the powers of the Minister, it will be capitalised when the railways are taken over, and that capitalisation will be the claim of the companies. These powers practically cover everything that can be done. They cover rates, salaries, and all the other matters set out in Clause 3, Sub-section (1) (	<i>c</i>). What it really amounts to is this: taking the net revenue of the railways for the year before the War, whatever that might have been, and deducting from it the net revenue of the railways when they are finally handed over, the balance, whatever it may be, will be capitalised, and that capitalised value will form the subject of the claim of the railway companies. I quite agree that any depreciation which is caused by the action of the Minister, and which would not inevitably have happened in any case, should be the subject of depreciation, but what I do suggest is there would not be a claim for depreciation for anything which was bound to happen altogether outside the powers of anything the Minister has done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Take the question of wages. Can it be supposed that, if the Government had not taken over the railways at all, and they had gone on as before, there would not have been sufficient pressure to increase wages very materially? I venture to say that that pressure could not have been resisted. Under the Clause as drawn, however, you are going to saddle the whole of the burden of the increased wages, which were bound to have come in any case, upon the taxpayer, and I do suggest that that is something which the taxpayer ought not to be asked to do.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0576">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1141</span>
So far as I can make out, we have not got, I think, even yet, the actual figures, but the amount involved will be absolutely incalculable. I do not know whether it has yet been stated what the net revenue of the railways was before the war. If the Minister would tell us what the net revenue is likely to be two years hence, and if he could give us some forecast of what he thinks the revenue would be two years hence, supposing the Government did not interfere at all, then we should get some idea of our liability under this Clause. I move this Amendment in order to do two things. First of all, it will put the matter in the position which it would have been under the Agreement. It allows the matter to stand as the Agreement fixed it—whatever that was—up to the passing of this Act, and after the passing of this Act the Amendment eliminates this question of wages from the operation of this depreciation Clause. The Amendment might meet with a better reception if it were altered so as to cover both the point of wages and the point raised by my hon. Friend Mr. Joynson-Hicks as to fares, so that whichever way the thing goes you have these two matters—wages and fares—entirely excluded, and the exercise of the other power could then form a very proper subject for depreciation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. and gallant Gentleman has moved this Amendment under an error and a misapprehension. I understand him to say that he moves this Amendment because he thinks by so doing matters will be in the same position as they were under the agreement, but he is absolutely wrong in that contention. If this Amendment is carried, the effect will be completely to alter the position as it was under the agreement, and he will break the agreement and put in something entirely different. Let me point out what the real position is. A paragraph in the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, says that when Her Majesty by Order in Council declares certain things, then
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State may, by warrant under his hand, empower any person or persona named in such warrant to take possession in the name or on behalf of Her Majesty of any railroad in the United Kingdom."</p></blockquote>
And so on. Then it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There shall be paid to any person or body of persons whose railroad or plant may be taken possession of in pursuance of this Section, out of moneys to be provided by Parliament, such full compensation for any loss or injury they
	<span class='label label-info column'>1142</span>
may have sustained by the exercise of the powers of the Secretary of State under this Section as may be agreed upon between the said Secretary of State and the said person or body of persons, or, in case of difference, may be settled by arbitration in manner provided by the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HAYWARD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not this specific agreement exclude the operation of the Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. I am proposing to read the agreement. It really was not a regular agreement. It was arrived at at a meeting of the Executive Committee held on 6th August, 1914, and this was what was arrived at. This is an extract from the Minutes:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The question of the basis on which compensation under the Act of 1871 should be ascertained was discussed and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It was resolved to recommend that to ascertain the compensation payable the aggregate net receipts of all the railways taken over during the period for which they are taken over shall be compared with a similar aggregate for the corresponding period of the previous year. The ascertained deficiency shall be the amount of compensation due. Provided that if the aggregate net receipts for the first half of the year 1914 are less than the aggregate net receipts for the first half of the year 1913, the ascertained deficiency shall be reduced in the like proportion.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Any question as to the amount of the deficiency shall, in default of agreement, be determined by the Railway and Canal Commission.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The sum so payable as compensation, together with the net receipts of the railways taken over, shall be distributed among the railway companies in proportion to the net receipts of each company during the period with which comparison is made."</p></blockquote>
That was the agreement. That is all there was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask that that be not considered unless the whole of the agreement is read?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have read the whole of it. I am sure the hon. Member does not wish to accuse me of having stated what is untrue. I have stated that that is the whole of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg the right hon. Gentleman's pardon I understood him to say the part he was reading had reference to compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the whole of the agreement. Part of this agreement was afterwards modified, and the part that was modified was this—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that if the aggregate net receipts for the first half of the year 1914 are less than the aggregate net receipts for the first half of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0577">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1143</span>
year 1913, the ascertained deficiency shall be reduced in the like proportion."</p></blockquote>
That was afterwards modified in consideration of certain things which were done by the railway companies, but with that exception there has been no modification of the agreement. Putting it shortly, the agreement provides for the amount of rent which is to be paid to the railway companies for their occupation by the Government. That is practically what it is, and nothing else, and it was a very good bargain for the Government, because up to 31st December of last year they have actually made a profit—perhaps a small one, but a profit—upon this agreement. The Committee will remember that I read from the Act of 1871 these words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"such full compensation for any loss or injury."</p></blockquote>
This did not relate to injury. It could not relate to injury on 6th August, 1914, because we did not know whether we were going to be injured or, if so, what that injury would be. This was merely an agreement to provide for the amount of money to be paid as rent to the railway companies for having their lines. What the Bill does is to confirm the arrangement of 1871, that if there should be any injury when the railways are handed back—if they are ever handed back—that injury should be paid for. In order that there might not be any doubt about that, the railway companies wrote to the Government, when this Bill was supposed to be brought forward, and they received a letter which I propose to read:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Dear Lord Bessborough,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>With reference to the points raised at the meeting with the Railway Companies' Association on Thursday, 13th March, I should be prepared:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(1) To recommend the Government to accept an Amendment to the effect that any claims that the railway companies may have under the Act of 1871 or otherwise should not be prejudiced by the Bill."</p></blockquote>
Which is what the hon. and gallant Member is trying to do.
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) To recommend to the Government, in the event of the control over the railways ceasing at the end of the two years' period contemplated under Clause 3, that the actual rates and charges then in force should continue, and be deemed to be within the statutory maxima of the companies for a further period of eighteen months after intimation had been given to the companies of the Government intention to relinquish control to enable legislation to be promoted to revise their charging powers.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Yours sincerely,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(Signed) RHYS WILLIAMS.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(For Sir Eric Geddes.)"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1144</span>
I have, I think, shown clearly that the hon. and gallant Member is under a misapprehension as to the reason and effect of this Clause. I trust I have made the matter clear, and that he will withdraw his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HAYWARD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before doing so, I should like to state that I do not think the right hon. Baronet has accurately stated what this Amendment would do. I quite agree that, whatever the position was before the passing of this Act, whatever the rights and obligations were, they should remain exactly as they were under the agreement and the previous Act. Exactly as they were under the previous Act. I think my Amendment will leave it so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major HAYWARD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be willing to alter my Amendment in any way to make it quite clear. What has been said does not touch the other point I put forward. I shall be prepared to withdraw my Amendment, but my impression is that hundreds of millions may be involved—or at any rate large sums of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the fears of my hon. and gallant Friend are really well founded. Compensation is only payable where what is done is the act of the Minister in exercising his powers under the Act. It must affect the value of the concern upon a revenue-earning basis. If the wages have to be raised it is a question of choice. Undertakings will have their choice. They can either concur with the Minister, or, if they do not like it, they can close their concern. They need not keep it open if they find they cannot pay the wages or work at a profit. Probably they would be left alone. But the probability of depreciation in revenue-earning capacity, owing to increase of wages, is not really so great as my hon. and gallant Friend seems to think. Certainly the idea that it would mean hundreds of millions to the community is not accurate. There are cases where the community ought to bear the loss. If the Minister, to benefit the community, allows a rise of wages, and, on the other hand, refuses to allow charges to be raised to meet that, the shareholders are not the proper people to bear that loss. It is the community. In that sense the community would have to bear the extra cost of wages. In other cases the extra cost of wages would be met in the ordinary way—as in ordinary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1145</span>
business, by an increase of price. Where it happened that the Minister said, "We cannot raise rates, it would affect some trade"—cotton, wool, or whatever it might be—well, then, it would be unfair that the shareholders of the undertaking should be the persons to suffer, The community who benefited would have to pay. To suggest, however, that this is going to make an enormous charge upon the community is an unfounded fear. In any case, you must have power to take it into consideration. It is just one of those cases where, if you put in any limitation, you are much more likely to do hardship or injustice than you are to secure justice. It is much better to leave at this stage the power to the tribunal without hampering it by these limitations which really work more harm than good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to Move, in Sub-section (1), after the word "Section" ["in paragraph (1) (	<i>a</i>) of that Section"] to insert the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"or where, by reason of the exercise by the Minister of the said powers, any loss or injury is sustained by the owners of any undertaking of which possession is taken by the Minister under the said Section, then."</p></blockquote>
I have several other Amendments which will be read in conjunction with this, but I will, of course, speak on the one. We have been dealing with questions affecting the value of undertakings, and the object of these Amendments of mine is to deal with questions that do not affect the value of the undertaking. May I just call the attention of the Home Secretary to instances in previous discussions on various sections of this question? An Amendment of mine was being discussed on 10th April to a Clause giving the Minister certain powers. The Minister-designate said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We gave great thought to the Clause. In fact it is to protect the interest of which he has spoken that this power is given to the Minister to give an Order. We all know the way these things are done when a strike is on. Under this the Minister has to give the Order. It is earmarked, and you can claim compensation for it. It is the greatest possible protection I can give."</p></blockquote>
Again, the Home Secretary later said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With regard to the fears that some larger thing may be undertaken, and cannot be completed in the two years, there are two safeguards. One is the safeguard of the money limit, beyond which they must come to Parliament for permission to spend more, and the other is the question of compensation. If a few thousand pounds were spent to the detriment and loss of a company"—</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1146</span>
That has nothing to do with the money value of the company.
	<br><blockquote><p>"the money is advanced by the Government, and the compensation Clause comes in."</p></blockquote>
Again, the Home Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I appreciate that if a railway has bought a piece of land which it will require for its own future purposes, and if it finds it is taken by the Ministry for the purpose of a dock, or road, or something of that sort, it is a loss to the railway and the railway will feel that it has been deprived of some method of development. There is a compensation Clause in the Bill, of course, but we hope to bring forward an improved compensation Clause—and that is one of the reasons for which the compensation Clause is put in."</p></blockquote>
Further—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every endeavour will be made to safeguard the interests of local authorities and everybody else, otherwise the payment of compensation would be heavy; but, at the same time, it is one thing to say you will try to deal as fairly as possible and provide compensation, and another thing to put in a power which might render the Ministry absolutely impotent in carrying out an important scheme."—</p></blockquote>
As far as I have been able to understand the compensation Clause which we have been discussing to-day, the question is one of enhanced or decreased value of the undertaking. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will point out where these cases to which I have incidentally referred come? If he can satisfy me upon the point there is no need to proceed further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel some considerable difficulty in dealing with the points put forward by the hon. Gentleman, although I tried carefully to follow him. I am sorry I cannot understand what is his difficulty. I am sure that was my fault. The fact, however, remains that I cannot follow what he is asking us to do. The Amendment itself appears to draw some distinction between damage to the undertaking and loss or injury which is sustained by the owners of the undertaking. I cannot understand what the difference is. We provide in this Clause for any damage that is done to the undertaking. What is loss or injury to the owners of the undertaking? Is it sentiment? I do not follow what it is. The owners of the undertaking, of course, are not the same entity as the undertaking itself. I understand that it is possible there may be some kind of moral, or intellectual damage which the owner would suffer, although no damage was done to his undertaking. But I cannot follow the rest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Minister really dealt with this point in his opening speech this morning. I do not quite know whether he really is right. It says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"There shall be no claim for loss in consequence of any direction issued by the Minister provided the directors of the undertaking concur."</p></blockquote>
If you put that in, the inevitable result will be that harmonious working between the directors and the Minister will disappear. Suppose for instance, the manager of the undertaking comes to me and says, "The Ministry is beginning to give us directions under the provisions of this Act." I shall be bound to say, "Be very careful; you must not concur in any direction, because if you do, and there is loss, you cannot get compensation under the Bill. You had better formally put in a caveat in any direction the Minister gives."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They would have the enhancement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether enhancement ought to come into this Clause. We are dealing with a question of loss. The Minister has all kinds of power to give directions, and merely because he is working in friendly contact with the directors of a harbour, dock, or railway, he says, "I want you to make such-and-such improvements—this bit of permanent way, or to alter the size of trucks" and so on. They may do it, and it may or may not be good for the undertaking. My right hon. Friend may have unwittingly misled the director or directors. They may concur to their detriment. It would be much better for them not to concur. I see no reason why their right for loss should be taken away if they work on friendly lines with the Minister, and concur in his directions.

	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided, further, that in any case where the owners of an undertaking are a company, which had not, previously to the passing of this Act declared a profit of 4 per centum out of profits in any one year on its ordinary shares, the company shall not be liable for enhancement of the value of their undertaking under the provisions of this Section, except in so far as the enhancement exceeds the amount of revenue required to pay 4 per centum on the ordinary share capital of the company issued and paid up at the passing of this Act."</p></blockquote>
I do not wish to trespass on the undertaking given by my hon. Friend to yourself, Mr. Chairman, when the previous Amendment was under discussion. I understand the difficulties the Government must have in agreeing to this particular Amendment, and I merely move it in order that they may give us some indication of what they have in mind when dealing with the smaller railways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This the Committee will realise is a proposal to guarantee to the railways a certain fixed revenue, which we could not possibly undertake to do. With regard to the smaller railways, there is no proposal to make any distinction between the small and the large. We hope all undertakings will be dealt with fairly, but we cannot undertake to make any distinction between the small and the big companies. As was pointed out, the provisions proposed for the small railways that have not been successful would avail for such undertakings as the Great Central, which is certainly not a small railway. We have already accepted an Amendment which allows a small railway to take advantage of any natural growth in its traffic, and that is all we can fairly be expected to do in the Act itself.

	<br><blockquote><p>"which working expenses shall include the provision of moneys to meet loans falling due for payment."</p></blockquote>
Sub-section (2) presumes that the Minister has taken over the undertaking, and, therefore, controls all the expenses. In other words, he has taken over the exchequer of the undertaking. Provision is made there for ordinary outgoings like wages and stores. But take a dock where short loans have become due. I can see no provision whatever for putting in all these charges to meet the payment of loans. Of course, I am assuming that the railways are not going to renew them. It is quite on the 	<i>tapis</i> that if the people who make these loans to the trusts find the Government are in possession, they may not be willing to lend the money as before. This is no imaginary matter, because these trusts have always large sums of money falling due on short notice, and it would be a serious thing for a dock company to find no provision by the Government to provide the money. Perhaps I am wrong, but the Minister will enlighten me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid we cannot accept this Amendment as it stands. My hon. Friend will see that Sub-section (2) provides that these forms of guarantee may be as consideration or as part of the consideration for exercising any powers of control. The provision of money to meet loans that fall due for repayment is a rather different thing from guaranteeing the dividends on stock or security. It is a very different form of payment and a very different thing. If any dock company finds itself in a difficulty, there is power in the Minister to provide money for the maintenance of docks or railways or any other things under Clause 4 of the Bill. Money may be advanced for the maintenance of a dock, and short loans would be for the purposes, no doubt, of the maintenance of a dock. If it was for new construction, equally it would be out of the power of the Ministry to advance the money. But the repayment of loans is met not in the least by short loans. They might be old-standing loans coming due for repayment. That the Minister must include something as something to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>1150</span>
guaranteed is more than we can possibly accept, and I hope my hon. Friend will see that what he has in view—the provision of necessary money of maintenance—is provided for under the Bill in another way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not seem to be provided for under Clause 4, as was described just now. I draw your attention to Sub-section (2). That is not guaranteeing the dividend, as the right hon. Gentleman says. It is working expenses from day to day. Suppose, now, there is £100,000 falling due, as would have been the case—probably more than that, on 15th May last—how long is it going to take before we can get the money to pay this? The provision, I think, is very uncertain. It is not exactly for maintenance. We might be told when we give up, "This is not maintenance. It is one of your loans. We have nothing to do with it." I am more confirmed in that opinion by what the Home Secretary says. I wish to press the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (3), after the word "Minister" ["wherever the Minister has"], to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the concurrence of the owners of the undertaking."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph (i) of the proviso says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"No claim in respect of any loss alleged to be due to any direction issued by the Minister shall be entertained if the direction was issued with the concurrence of the owners of the undertaking."</p></blockquote>
If we are not to be able to recover any loss, why should we have to pay the Government what they call the "unexhausted value" of the expenditure, which might turn out to be of no use in the world? I would like the Home Secretary to describe to us what he means by "unexhausted value."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The meaning of "unexhausted value" is really what it says. Suppose, for example, you have spent a lot of money on locomotives or any other thing that has life which terminates, and from year to year depreciates, the "un-exhaused value" is the value of the remainder of its life when the concern is handed back. South of the Tweed an arbitrator or tribunal does not invent a value which does not exist, and if there is no "unexhausted value" there will be nothing to pay. Something which the

It is a question of paying the unexhausted value of some work which only lasts for a certain time, and which after a time disappears, the value ceasing to exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In some unfinished work there may be no value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a question of depreciation or enhancement. It is a question of where money has been spent by the State and the value, say, is still there, and it is either a case of the undertaking, when the concerns are handed back, grabbing it from the State for nothing or paying its fair value. The things belong to the State, and it is a question of asking them to pay a fair value. It is not a question of enhancement or depreciation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir FORTESCUE FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The insertion of the words of the Amendment would mean this, that unless the owners previously signified that they would agree to the purchase of these locomotives or whatever it was that was to be provided, withholding such concurrence would prevent the Minister being obliged to replace</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The MINISTER-DESIGNATE of WAYS and COMMUNICATIONS (Sir Eric Geddes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No; it would prevent them repaying the Minister. Whatever the Minister did during these two years, whatever capital he spent on any of the undertakings, at the end of the two years, unless the owners had agreed, and presumably they would not agree, if they wished to follow the policy of my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in paragraph (	<i>i</i>) of the Proviso—

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F.

That being so, I venture to think my hon. Friend would not be wise to press the Amendment. He may find some way out of it in the course of the Report stage, but, as it stands, I venture to think it is illogical and would paralyse the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They can refuse. No Act of Parliament can bind people to do what they do not want. The Minister takes possession and does it. It is a case of: "I do not want to be compelled to do a thing which I do not think is wise, and therefore, if I do not concur, the Minister carries it out; if I do concur, I am deprived of getting a claim from the Government if it turns out a bad job."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain R. GUINNESS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, at the end of Sub-section (6), to add the words,

	<span class='label label-info column'>1153</span>
I venture to think that this is an Amendment of substance, because it is obvious that the people who are working the line in a real way should be the persons to be named under this Clause rather than people who have leased the line and who are not themselves actually working the undertaking. I, therefore, move this Amendment in the hope that I may get some indication from the Government as to how they will deal with the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In principle we are quite prepared to accept this Amendment, but I do not think this is the proper place in which to insert the words providing what it proposes. If the words were inserted here, when the Act came to be interpreted it might be interpreted as meaning that in other parts of the Act, where the same words occurred, the meaning was not to be the same. There are other parts of the Act in which the words, "owners of the undertaking," occur, and where these very necessary words, for which we are much obliged, would also be necessary in order to protect those who are really working the undertaking. Therefore, if my hon. and gallant Friend will consent, the better way would be either to insert a new Clause or, on Report, to make an Amendment to the definition Clause which would embody these words, and would ensure that the words "owners of the undertaking" had that meaning in every part of the Act, and not merely in this particular section;</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It can be moved as a new Clause as soon as we have got through the rest of the new Clauses, or even after this, by leaving out the words, "Provided further that."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When that is done, I shall be obliged if the Minister will consider that that only refers to cases where a railway company is exclusively worked by another company. You want the word "exclusively" before "worked." There are cases in which railway companies are partially worked by other railway companies—sometimes by two or three other railway companies.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might I suggest that the Government should accept this as a new Clause, on the understanding that when we get to the Report stage, if they want to put it in in another place or to

alter the words, they should do it. There are such an enormous number of things that one forgets them. I forgot yesterday, on the question of competition, that the right hon.

May I suggest that my hon. and gallant Friend withdraws his Amendment and moves it in the form of a new Clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, at the end of Sub-section (6), to add the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"Notwithstanding anything in this Section, if any authority, body, or person owning any undertaking to which this Act applies claims that any direction of the Minister with reference thereto is unreasonable or calculated to damage the value of the undertaking, the authority, body, or person may appeal against the direction to the Railway and Canal Commission, who may cancel the direction or approve the same with or without modification."</p></blockquote>
This is the Clause which the Chairman yesterday ruled out of place where it occurred, saying that it was a matter to be brought up at the end of the Compensation Clause. I am bound to admit that there are a few words in the Amendment which really do bear the complexion of a claim for compensation, namely, the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"calculated to damage the value of the undertaking."</p></blockquote>
Let me, however, explain the purport of this Amendment. Early in the Debate there arose the question of whether an authority had no appeal against some Order of the Minister which they might think unreasonable, say for the construction of a dock or the alteration of a dock, the putting down of cranes, the scrapping of old cranes, or anything like that. There might be something done under this Bill which an authority might consider highly unreasonable. It might be of no cash value whatever, but it might damage the trade of the port. Not, perhaps, 	<i>quâ</i> dues; the income of the port might still be maintained, but it might either shift some trade
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0583">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1155</span>
from the district or in some way injure some of the schemes brought into operation because of the presence of the dock. We were told by the Home Secretary that Clause (30) of the Act of 1888 covered us, that there was power there to appeal to the Railway and Canal Commissioners. But it was found that there is no such power, and if we took that to the Railway and Canal Commissioners they would throw it over as not being within their jurisdiction. I understood that we were given a promise that we would have something to that effect and that later on we would hear what that is. It is quite evident that what we are seeking is not covered under the Compensation Clause as brought forward and as it is being discussed here. In Sub-section (6) we are only to be indemnified against the action of some third party, but it is not under that category that I am speaking. I am speaking of the case where Orders are to be carried out under the demand of the Minister of Ways and Communications which the authority, be it a dock or any other authority, may consider highly injurious, and, as I have said, upon which no monetary loss to the authority could be proved, although it might be a very serious thing for the traders — shipowners or others — connected with the trade of the port. All I ask is that, if such an order is given and the authorities involved consider it highly unreasonable, we should have some tribunal to which to appeal. I may be told by the Minister that he has set up an Advisory Committee, and that we can appeal to them and they will put their representations before him. Still, that is not quite a Court of Appeal, and we have been told several times that it is not to be looked upon as such, but that the Minister is to have full power over it. I would only ask at this stage whether he has anything to say to us which will give effect to our wish? That is the reason for my putting down this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are now finishing the discussion of the Compensation Clause, and my hon. Friend seeks to introduce into such Compensation Clause a provision which might have been very relevant in any Clause which enabled the Minister to exercise any of the powers given to him under the Act, but which cannot possibly be in place here. It raises the question, which really goes to the root of the whole
	<span class='label label-info column'>1156</span>
matter, whether there is to be a Court of Appeal set up over the Minister, which will hamper him, tie his hands, and cause great delay. I thought the Committee had decided that long ago, and I would ask them not to allow an attempt to be made to put into a Compensation Clause something which they would not agree to in any of the effective Clauses of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The very sequel has happened to-day which I foretold yesterday. I was ruled out of order by the Chairman, and I am sure all those who were present then will bear me out that he said that this was an Amendment on the Compensation Clause. He would not listen to me when I said it was not. I assure the Home Secretary that I have just the same objection to its coming in here that he has, but what could I do? I am certainly quite prepared to withdraw it from here, and keep it out of the Compensation Clause, because I think it has nothing to do with it. But where am I to get it in again? I was ruled out at the proper time. Of course, I will take it up on the Report stage. Or perhaps my want of knowledge of the methods here will induce the Chairman to say whether I can move it as a new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member wish to move it as a new Clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall repeat nothing, because I said nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant what was said by other people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning many of us ascertained for the first time what the agreement was between the railway companies and the Government for the taking over of the railways at the commencement of the War. There is no desire certainly on the part of myself—I cannot speak for others, of course—that the railway companies should not have to the full every benefit that they can claim under the agreement they made with the Government, but I do object, and that is the point of this Amendment, that the railway companies should have anything more than they are entitled to under the terms of their agreement up to the time when this Act is passed. It is not suggested by this Amendment that we should interfere with the compensation due to the railway companies from the date of the passing of this Act. It only deals with questions prior to the passing of this Act, which I submit should be treated under the terms of the agreement between the Government and the railway companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One objection to the discussion of a manuscript Amendment,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1158</span>
which one has not seen, is in this case that, so far as I can make out from the speech of the hon. Gentleman who proposed it, he is desirous of doing what another hon. Gentleman proposed this morning, but that Gentleman withdrew it upon an explanation being given of what the effect of it would be if it were passed. The speech of the hon. Gentleman who moved this Amendment was, as far as I understand it, practically the same as that of the hon. Gentleman who moved the other Amendment. He did not want the railway companies or any of the other companies to benefit on account of any injuries caused by the taking over or by any other action by the Government during the last four and a half years. But as I understand the manuscript Amendment that is really not the effect of it. The effect would be that they would not be entitled to greater compensation than they would have received if this Act had not been passed. That is to say, they would rely upon the Act of 1871. This Amendment is quite unnecessary if it does not give any more power than the Act of 1871 would give them. If the Amendment is to be taken, and not the speech of the hon. Gentleman, it is quite unnecessary and superfluous, and therefore should not be put in. But if it would carry out what he says it would do it would be mischievous, and it has been already rejected by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this went to a vote, I should not know how to vote. The statement made by the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment was handed in at a time when my whole attention was devoted to another Amendment which was under consideration, and as it was my duty I attended to that Amendment. I had only time to glance at the letter of this Amendment, and I confess I have not read it properly. I have therefore no clear notion of what it is intended to do. I think the hon. Gentleman who proposed it is the proper person to explain that. Then we have had the statement by the right hon. Gentleman (Sir F. Banbury) that it would have no effect at all. I should not like, not having had the Amendment before me for consideration, to offer any opinion at all, or to offer any advice to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been said that it is difficult to understand the words of the Amendment, but let me try to give an explanation of what seems to me to be simple. There is an agreement between the railway companies and the Government, which, but for the passing of this Act, meant that the railway companies would obtain, quite properly, large sums from the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Act from the date of its passing changes the circumstances under which compensation may be given to the companies. I desire by this Amendment to provide that up to the passing of this Act the agreement of 1915 between the railway companies and the Government shall be taken and considered as regards any question of compensation between the Government and the railway companies, and that as regards any other matters of compensation this Act will take force from the time it is passed, just in the same way for railway undertakings as for the other undertakings. The Government did not take over the whole of the railway undertakings, although that is sometimes understood to be the case. The effect might be that some of the railway companies would be quite differently treated if they were taken over under this Act, from the other companies which have been already taken over. That is quite clear. Up to the present we did not know exactly what the agreement between the railway companies and the Government was. It has been a mystery, and, therefore, I should not be blamed now for putting my proposal in the form of a manuscript Amendment, Under the terms of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1160</span>
that agreement the Government and the railway companies can settle any question of compensation. Let that agreement look after itself, but any compensation after the passing of this Act should be dealt with under this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the hon. Member only goes to prove how difficult it is when these manuscript Amendments are handed in. I quite understand how it is that he has been able to put it down only at the last moment. It is a great pity that important Amendments should come up in manuscript form. Even when one has an Amendment on the Paper, how careful one has to be to see what it means; sometimes just one word or another makes the whole difference: I would make a suggestion that the hon. Member should put this down as a new Clause. I should not be prepared now to vote against it or to support it. If it were to go to a Division I should have to say that I would not vote, but we ought to be able to make up our minds whether the thing is right or wrong. Sir Frederick Banbury has paid great attention to railway matters and the hon. Gentleman who has moved the Amendment has also some knowledge of them, and seeing that they do not agree I suggest that this Amendment should now be withdrawn, and that it should come up on Tuesday in the form of a new Clause.

There has been some difficulty about this Wagon Clause, and we have come to the conclusion that the better way will be to bring up a simple Clause giving powers and leaving the terms to be settled in each Order in Council as it comes up.

Friend, will the meeting suggested yesterday not now take place? Might I also ask, as this matter is to come up on Tuesday morning, if the Clause will only be down on Monday? If so, it is hardly giving time for our necessary consideration and any proposed Amendment. I think for a question of this magnitude there should be time to consider the Clause which may be drafted even now, but of which we of the Committee have no idea.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NELSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then will the new Clause be discussed on Tuesday morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I expect the new Clause will be down to-night. All it does is simply to give power to take these wagons, but the terms will be thrashed out on the Orders in Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But you are going to proceed with the wagon Clause on Tuesday. Does that mean that we can proceed with other matters at this sitting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NELSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a new hand at Parliamentary procedure, but this seems to me to decide the question of privately-owned wagons being taken over by the Government. It is an enormous issue, and to decide without time to consider the whole of the facts that this can be done by Order in Council is in itself a very big step. Those of us interested in this matter feel, if I may use the phrase, that we have been rather jockeyed out of our position in
	<span class='label label-info column'>1162</span>
the sense that we have already considered two new Clauses put down, and were prepared to bring forward arguments from our side, and now along comes this Clause which is going to give the Government such enormous power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry that my hon. Friend has got the impression that there is any idea of jockeying the wagon interest or treating it lightly or arbitrarily. The reverse is the case. When I saw the Amendments to the Government Clause which were put down I suggested that we should have meetings about it. The more I have considered it the more have I come to the conclusion that the question deserves more consideration than we can give in the time allowed before next Tuesday. And it is to get this Bill through to the Report stage that we decided to propose the arrangement suggested by the Home Secretary. The Clause to-night will provide that the wagons can be taken over, that they shall be taken over by Order in Council, all the relevant provisions we have discussed will be reproduced in the Clause, and the taking over can be done by Order in Council, which will lay down the terms and the compensation to be paid, and that shall be approved by Resolution of both Houses. That arrangement will give us much more time to consider this question. The Bill can go through the Report stage, then to the Lords, and come back to the Commons while we are doing this. It will make no difference to the date when we can bring the arrangements into force, end will be much more satisfactory than rushing a Clause before next Tuesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is simply delegating back to the House the business that the House has sent to us here. No Order in Council to be discussed in the House of Commons will go through upon this very important question without a great deal of discussion, and any time that may foe-saved to this Committee would be wasted in the House downstairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NELSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the Minister-designate has just stated, and when I made the statement that we had been jockeyed I only meant that previously we had time to consider the matter, but it is not now proposed to give us that time. Prior to the Order in Council coming in, I would appeal to the Minister to try, before each Order, to

	<div class='clause'>NEW CLAUSE.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(Roads Department and Under-Secretary.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<ol>
	<li>There shall be established a separate Department of the Ministry (hereinafter referred to as the Roads Department) to which all matters relating to the exercise by the Minister of his powers and duties with reference to roads, bridges, and ferries shall stand referred, and the Minister before exercising any such powers shall receive and consider the report of the Roads Department with reference to the matter in question.</li>
	<li>(	<i>a</i>) It shall be lawful for His Majesty by Order in Council to establish a consultative council in connection with the Roads Department for giving, in accordance with the provisions of the Order, advice and assistance to the Minister and to the Roads Department in connection with such matters affecting or incidental to roads, bridges, and ferries as may be referred to in such Order;</li></ol>
	<ol>
	<li>Such consultative council shall include representatives of the highway authorities and the road users;</li>
	<li>The establishment of such consultative council shall not be deemed to prevent any of the bodies represented thereon having access, either directly or through their representative associations, to the Minister or the Roads Department.</li></ol></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Clause be read a second time."</p></blockquote>
This Clause has been on the Paper for some time, and it may be that the second part is not necessary to press or proceed with in view of what is being done in other connections. The first Sub-section is to establish in the Bill a separate Department to deal with roads, and it was put down because in introducing the Bill the Minister recognised that there were two points on which there were general feelings of alarm and concern. One was in regard to Orders in Council and the other of an entirely different nature—namely, the roads which he is taking over. The Minister then said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As to the roads I would propose if this Bill becomes law that the roads shall become a separate part of the Ministry."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1164</span>
So that he actually announced then that if the Bill became law it was his intention to set up a separate Department for the roads. The intentions of the Minister may be excellent, and what he said then possibly induced a number of people to vote for the Second Reading. We now desire that what he said in the House shall be made obligatory and statutory in the Bill itself. The Minister promised a separate Department and we want definite provision for that Department. There is this very definite distinction between roads and almost every other form of undertaking. Roads are not a revenue-earning or business concern. They exist for the use of everyone, administered in the past by local authorities and controlled in recent days by the Road Board, which had. a certain connection with the authorities in administration and finance. I ask the Committee to support the Clause which makes it obligatory upon the Minister and his successors that in the Ministry there shall be a separate Department for roads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Clause does far more than set us a Department. It provides for consultative committees and all sorts of complicated procedure. Moreover, it provides that the Minister must do what any commonsense Minister would do, that is to consult his Road Department when he deals with road matters. It is a last effort to endeavour to lay down a departmental procedure, and I think, having regard to what I said in speaking on roads in the House, it is a pity that that should be brought up in any way as a pledge that we should have a statutory Road Department in the Ministry. As my hon. Friend knows, this decision to have a separate Road Department in the Ministry was come to before there was ever any decision or public feeling worked up at all. It would be entirely without precedent in the history of government for an Act to provide that in the Ministry itself there should be a separate Department which by Statute should do certain things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will not misunderstand me. I recognise that since this Clause was put down certain changes have taken place, like Advisory Committees, and I do not think he should argue that I am trying to do something unreasonable and to fetter his hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then I understand that the second part of the Clause is not to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0588">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1165</span>
moved. Dealing with the first, this provides for a Department which the Minister must consult before exercising any of his powers. He has got to receive and consider a Report from the Roads Department. Really I think it is quite unnecessary. If one Department for roads, why not one for canals? Every particular interest will want a special department on that argument. I hope the Committee will not pass this Clause, because it seems to me a pinprick at the end of the Bill. I said frankly that I thought the best organisation would be for a Roads Department to be set up, and I cannot think that my successors, if I become the Minister, will depart from that. Ferries may or may not come into the Roads Department. I should think probably not. To provide a Department I do not think will do any good. I think it may hamper the Minister and interfere with proper organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my right hon. Friend will say when the Committee has finished its work that he prefers his enemies to his friends. I do not think I ever suggested such a strong Clause to fetter the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are you a friend or an enemy? A friend, I think.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad the right hon. Gentleman appreciates the fact that all my efforts are to improve his Bill. What I was going to suggest was that it was rather too powerful a Clause to put in at the end, but some of us hope that before the Report stage we may be able to agree over the roads in a way which will give the great road authorities of the country some independence from the clutches of the right hon. Gentleman, which they hope to get, and I would be glad if my hon. Friend would consult with me to see if we could not frame a Clause which the House could pass.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NEAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the right hon. Gentleman has entirely mistaken the intention of the Mover of this Clause. I am sure it was not with any desire of pin-pricking or causing any inconvenience. I have a recollection that the Minister-designate met a deputation of the County Council Association and Municipal Corporations Association very kindly on this matter, and intimated his intention of setting up a Department. I am not desirous of pressing this Clause, therefore, and seeing that my hon. Friend has a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1166</span>
renewal of that statement now, I should be personally obliged if he would see his way to withdraw the Clause. I am sure everything points to the fact that the right hon. Gentleman is not going to interfere unduly with the great road authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite willing to bow to the feeling of the Committee on this matter, but I must raise a word of protest against something said which is extremely unfair, and that is the suggestion that this is a pinprick put in at the end of the Bill. I endeavoured to raise this Clause before, and it was entirely on the advice of the Chairman that it was put at the end of the Bill. It is, therefore, no fault of mine that it appears at the end of the Bill. I had no wish to hinder or to hamper the Minister in any way. If the assurance he has given satisfies the Committee, I will withdraw the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Clause be read a second time."</p></blockquote>
It is not a very long Clause, but it raises an important question. To my mind, it is not only the thin end of the wedge, but a very important chunk of the wedge in the direction of State control of the liquor traffic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might shorten the discussion if I say that all the railway companies hotels are to-day part of the undertakings taken over. It is not intended to make any change in that arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all deference, they are at present under D.O.R.A., but they are not taken over under this Act. We are asked to give enormous powers under this Act. We have given powers to take over railways, and that includes the hotels. I cannot see what difference there is between that and State public-houses. They are State public-houses to all intents and purposes. I think it would require considerable discussion before Parliament would agree to such control of the liquor traffic. I think the Minister would be very ill-advised to take such responsibility as the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1167</span>
possession of these hotels will entail. By Clause 9 of the Bill
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister may sue and be sued by the name of the Minister of Ways and Communications."</p></blockquote>
Under that Clause, the Minister may be responsible for diluting spirits, charging too much for beer, and in other ways I think he is bringing upon his devoted head responsibilities of which he does not recognise the enormity. Therefore, I sincerely hope the right hon. Gentleman will give us an assurance that when he takes over the railways he is not going to take over the hotels in connection with them. If he does, it opens the door to a great extension of this system. We should have a gigantic control of the liquor traffic indirectly in the hands of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ROYCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could never have the effect which the hon. Member fears while local licensing authorities deal with the licences. That fear is quite groundless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LINDSAY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Clause were passed, would it prevent the Minister taking over the hotels of the railway companies? I know a small company in Ireland which owns a large hotel. If the hotel were not taken over, they would run at a considerable loss. It is not clear, but it may be the Minister can take hotels if he wants to, or that the railway companies can keep them. If the railway companies have the right to keep them I do not object. My hon. Friend did not take the question of refreshment rooms. It is not suggested at all that the Minister should not take them over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WATERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Committee will not pass this Clause. I think it was only yesterday the hon. Member for Newcastle told us on this side that we were not exactly modest in the claims we put forward. I think I can retaliate with that retort at the moment. I believe, as one who has been in the industry, that railway hotels are part and parcel of the undertaking. It may be known when the fact is called to the attention of the Members that it is the hotel people who are responsible for all the dining and restaurant cars traversing the country, with the exception of the Pullman cars. I think the State could control the liquor traffic and could manage the business equally as well as the people who are managing it to-day, and I see no fear of the possibility of the Minister-designate asking or getting a position usually known in
	<span class='label label-info column'>1168</span>
London as that of the barman. I hope the Committee will turn the Clause down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it will be apparent to the Committee that it would be entirely impossible to leave hotels out. In many cases they are part of the station and the staffs are responsible for the working of the dining cars, with very few exceptions. They are part of the undertakings and the guarantee of the two years covers hotels. It would be a work of tremendous difficulty to take them out and provide alternative organisation. I hope the Committee will Dot pass the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question, "That the Clause be read a second time," put, and negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NELSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might I suggest, Mr. Chairman, before you adjourn the Committee, that you test the feeling of the Committee as to whether we sit on Tuesday morning or should adjourn till Tuesday afternoon, in view of the simplicity of the Clause likely to be brought forward by the Minister-designate on that day</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, as I understand to be the case, the wagon-owning interest are not in any way raising the general question as to whether the wagons should or should not be taken over, I think the Committee could in all probability easily settle the Clause in the afternoon Session. There is no Amendment which raises that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NELSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no Amendment down to that effect. I believe another Member of the Committee may possibly be raising that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander DAWES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of adjournment, I wish to ask your indulgence to bring forward a matter. On Tuesday last it was decided we should not sit on Tuesday afternoon, on account of the Finance Bill. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Ealing is not here. He said, in supporting the adjournment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think this involves a very serious constitutional question. We are sent here to represent not merely our constituents in relation to Bills of this description, but primarily sent as Members of the House of Commons to have a check over finance. Finance is the great thing over which the House of Commons is the protector of the people. If we are to be prevented from going down and discussing the Finance Bill, or hearing the arguments in support of the Second Reading, I say it is a grave breach of constitutional practice which ought not to be permitted."</p></blockquote>

It is a matter for the Committee to decide when they will sit, but if the question of the wagons is not going to be debated at great length I think it could probably be disposed of in an afternoon. So far, however, as the Government are concerned, we should wish to consult entirely the views and wishes of the Committee, which I should interpret to be that we should try and settle this in one more day's sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that there is no question now but that wagons will be taken over, or rather that powers will be given for wagons to be taken over; but certainly there are objections, and there will be Amendments to the effect that certain wagons shall not be taken over, and possibly that may take some little time to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain GUINNESS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that it would be as well to move the adjournment of the Committee now until Tuesday morning at eleven o'clock, and not go on discussing all sorts of things now. I accordingly move
