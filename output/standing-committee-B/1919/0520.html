	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we commence to-day, I think it is advisable to draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that the Second Reading of the Finance Bill, which is always looked upon as one of the most important measures of the Session, is to be taken in the House
	<span class='label label-info column'>1016</span>
this afternoon, and I venture to hope that this Committee will agree to adjourn at 1 o'clock for the day. The conditions are very different from what they would be in the ordinary course of events, owing to the new procedure. A certain number of us are kept in one special Committee, and we do not have a chance of being present at the important Debates that take place in the House. I hope, at all events, the difficulties that were foreseen before the new procedure came into operation, and that have been proved, will have the result at the end of this Session that we shall go back to the old style, when only certain specific Bills were sent to Standing Committees. I cannot help thinking that the general consensus of opinion will

	<span class='label label-info column'>1017</span>
be opposed to the present method in which these measures are carried through. I do hope—because it is absolutely necessary that we should make ourselves conversant with what takes place in the House on the Finance Bill—that my right hon. Friend will see his way to agree to adjourning at one o'clock until tomorrow morning. I, therefore, beg to move

	<p>	<div class='member'>The MINISTER-DESIGNATE of WAYS and COMMUNICATIONS (Sir Eric Geddes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, in this matter, as before, we are in the hands of the Committee, and if the Committee wishes to adjourn we shall have to accept that, but I had hoped that we would have got through the Committee stage of this Bill this week. I very much fear that if we do not sit this afternoon, we may not be able to get the Bill through this week. I quite realise the anxiety of certain Members to hear the proceedings in the House to-day, just as certain Members wished to hear the proceedings in the House on the Electricity Bill, when we adjourned; but, I think, if the Members who attended the Second Reading of the Electricity Bill had been absent, we still might have got a quorum, if that had been the only reason. I do hope the Committee will sit to-day with the object of concluding the Committee stage this week. But I am in the hands of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has been very conciliatory in this, but there has been a three-line Whip issued this morning for us to be in the House by 7 o'clock, when an important Division is expected to take place on the Finance Bill. Of course, I know it is the common practice that Members can go in and vote as the Whips tell them, but it is not desirable on a Bill of this kind, when a most important Amendment is being moved to the Finance Bill by the organised Opposition, and which raises very vital points of interest to Labour, to the Liberal party and, of course, to the Government. I think my right hon. Friend would not find that it would delay his Bill very much if he let us go down this afternoon in order to take part in the Debate, and to hear the arguments before attending the Division at 7 o'clock. Speaking for myself, and I think my hon. and gallant Friend (Sir F. Hall) there is not likely to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1018</span>
be any other occasion on which we shall move the adjournment of the Committee this week. Thursday being the Indian Budget would not affect this Committee at all, and I think, if the Committee would agree not to sit this afternoon, so far as I am concerned and those acting with me, we would give an undertaking not to make a similar Motion on any other day of the week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very anxious to get on with the Bill, and I am also anxious to meet the desires which have been expressed. Would it be a possible arrangement that we should sit till 2 o'clock to-day instead of 1 o'clock? [HON. MEMBERS: "We cannot!"]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am due in the City at 1 o'clock for a general meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could we sit on Friday to try to get the Bill through this week? After all, none of us want to drag out the proceedings here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure we are all desirous of assisting my right hon. Friend, but I am sure he will appreciate that this is not the only Committee sitting. Unfortunately, some of us are at other Committees, and we have to dodge between one and the other. Although we want to help the right hon. Gentleman in every possible way, I do not think he should ask us, under the circumstances, to sit on Friday. We are taken up here from 11 o'clock until 6 o'clock on three days of the week, with the exception of lunch time and the time we are giving at Questions. To all intents and purposes we are here for three consecutive days each week from 11 till 6. I do not think we ought, if we are attentive to our duties for those three days, to be pressed, and I do not think, under the circumstances, he will, after reconsideration, press that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GRUNDY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to suggest that we might sit tomorrow and the following day from 4 till 7 o'clock, which would make up for the two hours we are giving up to-day, or, if we are in earnest

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think this involves a very serious constitutional question. We are sent here to represent not merely our constituents in relation to Bills of this description, but primarily sent as Members of the House of Commons to have a check over finance. Finance is the great thing over which the House of Commons is the protector of the people. If we are to be prevented from going down and discussing the Finance Bill, or hearing the arguments in support of the Second Reading, I say it is a grave breach of constitutional practice which ought not to be permitted. It just shows how quickly the safeguards of the House of Commons for the protection of the public are being loosened, and how gradually one by one the rights of the House of Commons are being lost. I do most vigorously protest that attendance at this</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do hope, however, he will not ask us to sit beyond six o'clock or on Friday. My reason for that is that I, like some other members of the Committee, have a number of other engagements. When we agreed to meet three days a week I sandwiched in my other engagements, fitted them in. If my right hon.

	<p>Brought up, and read the first time.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Clause be read a second time."</p></blockquote>
This Clause provides in the first place that officers and servants may be transferred either permanently or temporarily from undertakings which have been taken possession of by the Ministry under the powers of the Bill, and may be retained on the superannuation or similar funds of the undertakings during the period of control. The reason of that will be obvious to the Committee. The intention is that during the two years while the Ministry is being set up, and in anticipation of a possible closer relationship between the State and such undertakings as we are considering, it shall be possible for the officer to retain his pensions rights without
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1023</span>
the State having to incur the very considerable liability of practically buying him out. The consent for permanent transfer rests with the officer or servant himself, that being simply a freedom of choice as to his employer. For a temporary transfer the consent of both officer or servant and employer is necessary. It is provided that that consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The reason for that is really "this: Later in the Clause compensation is given to an officer or servant if he is displaced, or if he is offered work not reasonably analogous to the work which he is already performing. It might be possible for the servant or officer to decline to accept some other reasonable work given to him and then claim compensation; it is only for that reason the wording is put in. The remainder of the Clause safeguards officers and servants from any depreciation of their position owing to the acts of a Minister—and I hope and believe successfully does that! It provides in the two cases, the transfer and the case of the servant who is not transferred, but remains in the service of the undertaking for certain arbitrations. That is really the main purport of the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. EVELYN CECIL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like a word or two on this matter, because I myself have an Amendment down bearing closely on it. Though my Amendment, does not possibly cover every conceivable case, it certainly is very much simpler, and I hoped when it was put down, that it would adequately meet the requirements of this Bill. I am very anxious that no officer or servant shall be in any worse position in consequence of the passing of this Bill. I am anxious to provide full compensation for him if in any way he is likely to be in a worse position. I quite agree, however, that the right hon. Gentleman's new Clause is a very full one, and probably it is more suitable, in a way, to cover every possible circumstance. There is one portion of it to which I attach rather special importance. Paragraph (ii.) makes provision "for a standing arbitrator or board of arbitration appointed by the Lord Chancellor for the purposes of this Section." It is desirable that there should be provision for an arbitrator. The alternative would be, I presume, that the matter might be left to the uncontrolled decision of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1024</span>
Treasury, and in this House, and in these Committees we have at times got rather suspicious of the decision of the Treasury in these matters. At any rate, it thoroughly safeguards the situation for the officers or servants concerned, and I heartily welcome the suggestion that there should be an arbitrator proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the rest of the long Clause, I am in general sympathy—perhaps more so than I am with other portions of the Bill. I should very much like to call attention to two matters in it. Paragraph (v.) says
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Minister may direct that the office or situation of any existing officer or servant which he deems unnecessary shall be abolished."</p></blockquote>
Whatever else it may be, that certainly is a drastic provision. Whether it is absolutely necessary I do not feel convinced. The Committee ought to observe that provision before eventually agreeing to the passage of the Clause. It gives the Minister very great powers. Apparently at his own uncontrolled discretion he can say that any office or position is unnecessary, and with a stroke of the pen abolish it. I am not clear that that is the wish of the Committee. At the same time I do not want to hinder the working of this particular Clause; and if the Minister and the Committee are satisfied that the Bill will work well, notwithstanding that provision, I shall not press my remarks further. The other small point to which I want to call attention in the new Clause of the right hon. Gentleman is Subsection (4)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Section shall apply to persons who are, or have been, members of the staff of the Railway Clearing House, or the Irish Railway Clearing House, or any railway conference…"</p></blockquote>
I would add, "or shipping conference." That would fit in with the principle, or at any rate, rather more completely and adequately cover the ground than is done at present. Apart from these two criticisms, one of which is perhaps bigger and the other smaller, I should like to endorse my right hon. Friend's new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I desire to thank the Minister for this Clause. He has gone very far to meet the views of those who assembled at Whitehall Place some weeks ago to discuss this important question. In particular I am interested in some of the portions of the new Clause which come in paragraph (vii.) as to customary superannuation allowances made by the generosity
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1025</span>
of employers. It is astonishing when you come to inquire how many generous employers and companies there are throughout the country. With no legal compulsion and having no superannuation funds to which the Members contribute they yet voluntarily and by custom establish the practice of giving to those who retire after a long period of good conduct a voluntary pension. I am surprised that in the exigencies of modern competition it would be found impossible to do so, but it has been done. I am glad to see that the Minister has accepted that principle, contained in the Amendment I now put down, on behalf of the men of the North Eastern Railway and others and on behalf of a number of workers in the Port of London. I congratulate him and the Committee upon the acceptance of that principle. The point to which my hon. Friend has just called attention is, I think, a somewhat drastic one. As to the Minister being able to abolish an office, I would only make this observation. I should like to ask the Minister in charge whether this Clause is a permanent Clause or whether it is simply temporary for the two years. If the latter the provision, I think, is likely to be a very dangerous and harmful one, because you are going to hand back undertakings after two years. In the meantime, you have dismissed persons or declared their offices to be unnecessary and abolished them; then, so far as the undertakers who have conducted the concerns hitherto are concerned, you may do a very considerable injury. That ought to be cleared up by saying whether or not this is a mere temporary Clause. If it is I think it ought to go out, if it is permanent that is, of course, another matter altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make an appeal to the Committee. This subject has been discussed before and most of the points which are being taken will arise again on the various Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WATERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was somewhat astonished by the remarks of the last speaker when he began to deal with the question of generous employers. I am going to say definitely that there may be an odd case or two, but generally speaking in the transport industry we have found that whenever they have given a little gratuity out of the pension fund, afterwards they usually put it forward whenever we have made a demand for an advance
	<span class='label label-info column'>1026</span>
of wages. On this question of compensation I would like to ask the Minister-designate how far he is prepared to go with this question, and how far he will say what he means by compensation. I hope to put one or two points which will show that something far-reaching in this measure has got to be granted in order to give that amount of satisfaction which those working in this industry have a right to expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If many men are to be removed under this Bill it may mean a great amount of loss to them. Take the case of a man who may be fairly established in a particular centre. His children are well able, with their talents, to get a fairly good education. Such men will be compelled to leave their districts if they are redundant, and I think some regard ought to be had to these men because of the loss their children will sustain in having to take a different avenue of life, and neglect the education in which they were thoroughly established in their former centre. There is also the question that if a man's place has become redundant, and through family circumstances he cannot see his way clear to be drafted from one part of England to another, this man has some call upon the Minister-designate with reference to the question of superannuation, and also with reference to the Pension Fund benefits to which these men have been subscribing. I want to make it clear that all these points ought to be safeguarded, and my colleagues will not submit to anything being done detrimental to the best interests of those men in the service whom we represent. I feel that the Minister should give us some understanding or some line of thought that will lead us to believe that all these advantages will be retained for these men where it is found necessary to transfer them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make one or two observations which may shorten the discussion. This Clause has so recently been put down that I have not had time carefully to consider it. I want to mention one or two points relating to the earlier part of the Clause, and I think my hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1027</span>
I agree there must be some kind of jurisdiction to say whether an officer or servant is unreasonable in objecting to be transferred, but this is left in the hands of the Minister, who is the sole authority to say whether the objection is reasonable or not, and I think there ought to be some other provision there. It is further provided that
	<br><blockquote><p>"(ii) No existing officer or servant so transferred, whether temporarily or permanently, shall, without his consent be, by reason of such transfer or anything done under this Act, in any worse position in respect of the conditions of his service."</p></blockquote>
I do not see why he should be put in a worse position if he is forced to consent. He may perhaps have the powerful influence of the Minister against him. I do not mean the Minister personally, but the officials might say "You must consent," and the man nominally gives his consent, and he may be put into a worse position. In paragraph (	<i>ii</i>) provision is made for the appointment of a standing arbitrator or board of arbitration, to whom these questions may be referred, but apparently it applies only to questions under the provisions of this paragraph, because it states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"If any question arises as to whether the provisions of this paragraph have been complied with, the question shall be referred to a standing arbitrator or board of arbitration appointed by the Lord Chancellor."</p></blockquote>
I certainly think this should apply to all the provisions of this Section. Take for example the question of unreasonably withholding consent. That does not apparently come under the Lord Chancellor's arbitration, and I think it ought to come under that provision. There is one other point I hope will be considered, and it is the question of the effect upon a railway servant, and particularly the servants of the clearing houses, of the Regulation of Forces Act, 1871, which has been brought into operation, and under which possession of the railways has been taken, and I think it will be found that a large number of officers and servants of the railway companies have been rendered redundant more by the operation of that Act and of the Defence of the Realm Act provisions than by the operation of the Bill we are now discussing. I want to incorporate in this Bill the same rights and provisions as to gratuities, pensions and so forth, which are to be given to the railways if they are damnified under the provisions of this Act. I hope my right
	<span class='label label-info column'>1028</span>
hon. Friend will consider that point before we get to paragraph (iv.). I think this raises a very important question as to the people who have already been damaged 	<i>by</i> the operation of the Defence of the Realm Regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause read a second time.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move in Sub-section (1, i., 	<i>b</i>), to leave out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"which shall not unreasonably be withheld."</p></blockquote>
I do not think we should put that power into the hands of the Minister. It puts a certain amount of pressure on the servant, and therefore I think these words should be left out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Committee will not leave out these words. So far as I know the Minister is not the individual who decides whether it is unreasonable or not, because he has no power of compelling an officer or servant to transfer. He cannot order an officer to transfer to another undertaking. If they do not consent, and it is thought unreasonable, the only effect as I understand it—and this is the object with which the words were put in—is that if the officer or servant then claims compensation because his office is abolished, or he is given work which is not reasonably analogous to the work he was performing, he would then have to show that he had good reason for refusing to do the other work. The particular case in point is this, and I would like to mention it now, and tell the Committee the sort of case I have in mind. So far as I know, under the Act of 1871 the only servants who have been found redundant to any extent have been those in the London Clearing House. There, obviously the work has decreased very much because the division of duties between the railways and the inter-company arrangements have to a great extent been abolished. During the "War, when large numbers of the Clearing House staff were away, the staff was not excessive. Now I understand, although I have no personal knowledge of the subject, as they have been demobilised, the staff is becoming excessive, having regard to the amount of work which it has to do to-day. It would be quite unreasonable for a Railway Clearing House clerk, offered employment on a temporary transfer to the Ministry to do clerical work, for him to refuse if he were compensated for any additional expense to which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1029</span>
he might be put. If you do not put in these words a clerk could say, "I prefer to work at Euston where I know there is no work for me to do, and I decline to be transferred because I do not like to go to another place, and I want compensation because my office is abolished." The reason these words are put in is if the clerk claims compensation, then it could be pleaded that "you were offered a reasonable alternative to transfer with proper safeguards if put to any additional expense, and you did not take it, and therefore you have no right to compensation." I hope these words will be left in. I think that is the only case where there will be any large block of officers or servants which will be rendered redundant. It is really a two-years provision, and the compensation only lasts for two years. It may be that we may find men who were canvassers, and when they come back from the War they may no longer be required as canvassers. I know my right hon. Friend the Member for Derby (Mr. Thomas) shares the view that the ordinary wastage on these large undertakings will provide for economies, and there will not be any large displacement of staff. I understand that those who represent these servants have no apprehensions on that point, and therefore I hope the words will be left in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could my right hon. Friend accept the suggestion which I have made and bring the arbitration I have mentioned, and which is dealt with in the next paragraph, to bear upon these men also? It makes it difficult if the onus of proof is going to be on the man whom the Minister says unreasonably withheld his consent. Take a clerk in the Railway Clearing House, and the Minister wants to transfer him to his clerical staff somewhere in London. The man says "I do not want to be transferred," and then the Minister can say, "Well, you will lose all your rights to compensation," and so on. Then the clerk has to make an application to some Court to establish his right to compensation, and he has to show that his consent has not been unreasonably withheld. The Minister provides in the next paragraph for this arbitration to the Lord Chancellor, and I do not see why it should not extend to the question whether this clerk I have mentioned has acted unreasonably or has unreasonably withheld his consent to the transfer. I am arguing now against the law. I do
	<span class='label label-info column'>1030</span>
not want these unfortunate men to have to go to the County Court to establish their rights as against a powerful Minister, and, as my right hon. Friend is establishing this arbitrator, to whom every kind of clerk may go as to his position, conditions of service, gratuities, superannuations, and so forth, I suggest that he should extend the provision to cover the case whether consent is unreasonably withheld or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SEXTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have an Amendment down dealing with the very subject that the hon. Member is discussing, namely, the principle of extending arbitration to cover every case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Member withdraws.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We might hear what the right hon. Gentleman has to say first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Amendment will not be withdrawn until we have thrashed the matter out. If the Government are prepared to accept an Amendment on the lines suggested by my hon. Friend (Mr. Sexton) extending the principle of arbitration to cover the case of these men, then this Amendment might be withdrawn. I can quite conceive of cases of men employed in these large companies who have become accustomed to one class of work and to whom it might be said, "You must go now into quite a different line altogether." That would be pretty hard, and, although in some cases it might be necessary, they ought to have a reasonable opportunity of presenting their case and the Government ought not to be left in the position of being judge and jury as well. A man who is not agreeable to go to arbitration is not a fair man, and the man who is not prepared to accept arbitration is in the same category. I have had a great many cases in business, and I have always held that arbitration is the fairest course that can be adopted. Everybody then knows that he has had a fair hearing. If my right hon. Friend will say that he is prepared to leave this matter in abeyance until we reach the Amendment of my hon. Friend, and if the Chairman will allow the matter to be reconsidered on that Amendment, then we shall be satisfied, but let us give these people a fair opportunity. I am the last person in the world to say that people' who are redundant should be in a position to say, "I cannot do this work in future, but I am going to sit still and wait
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0521">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1031</span>
for work to come to me." That would be unreasonable, and everybody would back up my right hon. Friend there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt that this question can be discussed on the Amendment of the hon. Member for St. Helens (Mr. Sexton), but I hope, after the debate that has taken place, that that discussion will be limited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put the Amendment down solely for the protection of the men, but I never thought of supporting a man who took up the position suggested by my right hon. Friend. We have been taunted that we have no regard for those who serve under us. This, however, is a disinterested Clause. It is not going to help the dock companies. I put it down in order to protect any man who thought that he was aggrieved and did not want to be in the position of having to discuss whether he was reasonable or unreasonable. If the Committee does not want the Amendment, I do not press it, but I think the matter might be left over until we reach the Amendment of my hon. Friend (Mr. Sexton).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really think that there is a misapprehension. The words "Which shall not be unreasonably withheld "were put in for the reason that I have explained. Supposing that we want a man to transfer from one work to another and he does not consent, we cannot send a policeman to bring him over and make him work. There is no power to make him do it. He is, therefore, either left to continue in the work that he has had, or his, office is abolished, or he is dismissed. There is provision for arbitration and compensation for a man whose office is abolished, or who is asked to do unsuitable work, or who is dismissed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander DAWES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This paragraph does not extend to the whole Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really do not think that the hon. Member is right. Under Sub-section (1, i) If a man unreasonably refuses to transfer, you cannot send a policeman for him, all you can do is to abolish his office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander DAWES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That arbitration Clause refers only to certain things under that paragraph. The seventh paragraph is quite a different thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1032</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everything culminates in that paragraph. There are a whole lot of explanatory paragraphs, and paragraph (vii.) winds the thing up. If in the end such officer or servant "relinquishes his office or service as aforesaid" he is entitled to compensation. It is compensation for everything back to the beginning of paragraph (iii.). There are two arbitration provisions in the Clause. One of them deals with the officer or servant who is transferred, and the other deals with the officer or servant who is not transferred, but who remains in the employment of the undertakers and to whom something is done directly or indirectly by the Minister under the powers of this Act. If he is invited to transfer under Sub-section (1, i.), and he unreasonably declines to transfer, he will go on working at his ordinary work with no effect upon him at all, unless something is done by the Minister. The Minister can either abolish his office—it is not intended for that, but it is within his power—or give him unsuitable work, or do something of that kind which puts him in a position to claim compensation under paragraph (vii.). It is only then, so far as I can see and so far as I am advised, that those words "unreasonably withheld" can have any meaning at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then a man will not be prejudiced at all if he appears to you to be unreasonable, and you treat so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the arbitrator finds that he is unreasonable, I do not think that he would get compensation. It has nothing to do with the Minister The provision is merely put in so that a man cannot say, "I will not transfer to that building, because it is a brick building and I like to work in a stone building."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that in the event of arbitration the Minister would put up a case against the man whom they thought unreasonably withheld his consent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then you would put up a case to show why he should not have compensation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander DAWES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still unrepentant. The first arbitration Clause refers to paragraph (ii.), and to nothing else. The second Arbitration Clause merely refers to. officers who relinquish office, or whose services are dispensed with, and does not in any way affect the officer who refuses to be transferred. If instead of having two arbitration Clauses the right hon. Gentleman would accept the arbitration Clause standing in the name of the hon. Member for St. Helens (Mr. Sexton), it would be much more simple than having words which are open to discussion as to what they mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry if I cannot make the point clear. The arbitration Clause standing in the name of the hon. Member for St. Helens (Mr. Sexton) is one which we shall have to discuss when we come to it, but the Government cannot accept it for reasons that I shall give then. I wish I could make the point clear, because I am told by the Parliamentary draftsman that I am absolutely right on the interpretation of the Clause that we are now discussing. It is perfectly true that paragraph (vii.) only applies to an officer or servant who relinquishes his post or whose office is abolished, and so forth; it does not apply to arbitrating between the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the proposal to transfer. Supposing a man is invited to transfer and he unreasonably declines, the Ministry have no power to do anything except abolish his office or offer him unsuitable work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander DAWES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under which arbitration Clause does he come?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under paragraph (vii.), because he has relinquished his post, or his post has been abolished, or he is not given work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTONE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Amendment ought to be withdrawn. It is quite clear that the Minister must have these words in the Clause in order to deal with certain circumstances which may arise. If a man were unreasonable and his case were dealt with by arbitration, it would be the duty of the Minister to give full information to the arbitrator. The right hon. Gentleman has made a good case for the retention of these words, and I would appeal to my hon. Friend to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1034</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure we all agree that the Minister should have an opportunity of dispensing with people whom he does not want, but sometimes there are a number of men against whom there is a grudge. Some officer comes along and brings a complaint against them, and his evidence is taken in preference to that of those whom he alleges are unwilling to carry out the duties which he says devolve upon them. I agree with my hon. Friend opposite (Commander Dawes) that this arbitration Clause does not apply to the people in paragraph (i.). If the right hon. Gentleman desires it to apply to them, he should put in words in paragraph (i.) to make it perfectly clear that it does apply to them. We do not want, and I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman does not want, any men to be treated unfairly in any shape or form. Therefore, if it is his desire, and apparently it is, that they shall have the same chance of arbitration, which is only reasonable and fair, and if between now and the Report stage he will put in words in paragraph (i.) making it plain that these people have a right to arbitration, I think we might be satisfied and it would settle the matter as far as I am concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Committee are prepared to come to a decision on this matter now. Will the hon. Gentleman withdraw the Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the explanation given, I am quite willing to withdraw the Amendment, but it is a pity to have a Clause which business men cannot make head or tail of.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SEXTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move in Subsection (1, ii.) to leave out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"and if any question arises as to whether the provisions of this paragraph have been complied with the question shall be referred to a standing arbitrator or board of arbitration appointed by the Lord Chancellor for the purposes of this Section, and if the arbitrator or board consider that those provisions have not been complied with and that the officer or servant has thereby suffered loss or injury, they shall award him such sum as they think sufficient to compensate him for such loss or injury."</p></blockquote>
The reason of this Amendment is that the principle contained in this paragraph shall be extended over the whole Section. After the discussion we have had, I am going to limit my remarks as much as possible. We move to strike out these words, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1035</span>
to meet the case, when the Section is fully discussed, to add at the end the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5) If any question arises as to whether any of the provisions of this Section have been complied with, the question shall be referred to a standing arbitrator or board of arbitration appointed by the Lord Chancellor for the purposes of this Section and if the arbitrator or board consider that those provisions have not been complied with, and that the officer or servant has thereby suffered loss or injury, they shall award him such sum as they think sufficient to compensate him for such loss or injury and the costs incurred in prosecuting his claim."</p></blockquote>
I think the right hon. Gentleman who has charge of this Bill might accept that principle, because it really carries out his own wishes in the direction of any man unreasonably refusing to be transferred to any particular job. Who is to say whether it is reasonable or unreasonable, and if, in the opinion of the man himself, he has been unreasonably treated, should he not have the same right of appeal as any other man who is unreasonably treated? Take, for instance, the man who is transferred, and who is not definitely arranged for in this Section, and he has had some privilege in his employment. It may be that that man may claim to take with him to the Ministerial Department the same privilege, and that may be considered unreasonable. I think the principle of arbitration should spread over the whole Section, instead of being divided into paragraphs. Shortly, that is the object of this Amendment—to add to the Clause a provision which will meet the wishes of the right hon. Gentleman himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might suggest to hon. Members that, as this Amendment has a good deal to do with the Clause to be added, to which the right hon. Gentleman alluded, we might allow the discussion to range over the two, so as to avoid discussion on that Clause later on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I shall have to take up a little time to put before the Committee the position of arbitration under this Clause as I see it. This Clause really has three separate parts to it. The first part deals with the transference of officers and servants, and there, subject to the point we have just been discussing about the word "unreasonable," which I will not go into further at the moment, the whole position of a transferred servant is subject to arbitration under the provisions in the latter part of paragraph (ii.).
	<span class='label label-info column'>1036</span>
The next part of the Clause deals with officers and servants who remain in the service of their employers who are not transferred, but who are adversely affected by something that the Minister does under the powers which this Bill gives to him. The third portion of the Clause—that is, Sub-sections (2), (3) and (4)—provides certain protection for officers and servants who remain in the service of the undertakers, but who are not affected by actions of the Minister. It simply provides that, in estimating the expense, there shall be a continuance of customary allowances to them. In the first part, which relates to the transferred servants, you get arbitration. The second part deals with compensation for servants who remain in the service of the employers, but who are affected by orders the Minister has given under the Act. Compensation is provided for them on exactly the same basis as is provided for all local authorities' servants under the Local Government Act of 1888. That is the basis of compensation that is provided for them. It was also applied to the Port of London Authority's servants. Then the remainder—the second and third Sub-sections—require no arbitration at all, because the arbitration does not exist to-day. It is merely stabilising the existing position, and I do not think that arbitration should be introduced here, because there is nothing under this Bill which we are going to affect by it. There is no order that can be issued that will alter that at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the Amendment before the Committee, it is really providing a second arbitration for one part of the Clause and an arbitration for another part of the Clause, where no arbitration ought really to be given, because it is merely stabilising the existing practice, and it cuts out arbitration in the first part of the Clause. The hon. Gentleman does not omit the arbitration and the assessment of compensation in the latter part of paragraph (vii.) of Sub-section (1), and then he provides arbitration over the whole thing, covering Sub-sections (2) and (3), so that you are really going to get an arbitration and then another arbitration upon it. Then, again, you are going to get an arbitration, where, I venture to think, the Committee will agree no arbitration is concerned, namely, in Sub-section (2). There is no subject for arbitration there. The same in Sub-section (3). Arbitration is really provided here in two cases, one for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1037</span>
the transferred servants and the other for the servant damnified by action, direct or indirect, taken by the Minister under this Act. In both cases arbitration is provided, and in that Section a well-recognised basis of compensation is also provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to differ from my right hon. Friend, but I do not think that his Clause does meet the point raised by the hon. Member, and which I raised when discussing the Clause itself. It is quite true he has provided arbitration in the case of servants who are transferred, and also provided for servants who remain in their old employment, and are adversely affected, but there is no arbitration provided by my right hon. Friend, so far as I can make out, in any part of his Clause in the case of a servant who remains with the old firm and who is subsequently dismissed because he will not go over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, yes, in paragraph (vii.)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every such officer or servant who so relinquishes his office or service as aforesaid, and every such officer or servant whose services by or in consequence of any such direction are dispensed with on the ground that his services are not required."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In paragraph (v.)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister may direct that the office or situation of any existing officer or servant which he deems unnecessary shall be abolished."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the servant is dismissed, because his services are no longer required, or for any reason not being on account of any misconduct or incapacity, and it might be possibly that his office is abolished, and there is no one else to accept him, then he is entitled to compensation under the Local Government Act. If you offer him work which is unsuitable for him to perform, he can refuse and relinquish his post, and claim compensation on the recognised basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend explain a little more clearly what this basis is? I am very sorry, but, although I am to some extent a lawyer, this Clause is rather complicated to understand. What is the objection to giving the same right of arbitration to a servant whose consent is unreasonably withheld to a transfer under the provisions of Subsection (1), the same as the man who has been transferred under Sub-section (2)? Under Sub-section (1, ii.) my right hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1038</span>
Friend gives the right to what I may call the Lord Chancellor's arbitration. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No existing officer or servant so transferred, whether temporarily or permanently, shall, without his consent be, by reason of such transfer or anything done under this Act, in any worse position."</p></blockquote>
If that is so, and he is made worse under arbitrary transfer, he gets an arbitration under the Lord Chancellor's arbitration, which, as I understand, is not fettered by any of the conditions of the Local Government Act of 1888. I do not know what those conditions are, and no one seems to have told us. A man does not want to be transferred for some particular reason—a sick wife, or some other reason—which appears to him a good reason, but which my right hon. Friend says is not reasonable. He may say, "I do not think it is necessary that your sick wife or children should live in the country," or, "I cannot go into these questions, I want you in London, and you must come." The man says, "No, I want my children to live in the country, where they have been born and bred," and the Minister says, "That is not a reasonable objection."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will you continue the story?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says, "That is not reasonable." If that is not reasonable, that man is only entitled, as I gather, to resign his office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No; he goes on working where he is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then he is dismissed. Take a railway undertaking, and what may be an extreme case—a stationmaster, say, at Bodmin, in Cornwall, where he has lived all his life, and has a wife and family there, and the climate suits him. My right hon. Friend says to that man, "I am going to transfer you to Birmingham or Newcastle, where you must occupy a different position, though equal in regard to wages." The man says, "No, that is not reasonable. I do not like it, and my wife does not want to go." The Minister says, "That is not a reasonable objection," and he gives directions as Minister to the railway officials to dismiss this man, which he would be fully entitled to do, and the directions are bound to be obeyed. The man is dismissed. What right has he got to compensation or arbitration? I should be perfectly content, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1039</span>
I think my right hon. Friends opposite would be quite content, if that man went to the Lord Chancellor's arbitration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has the right of arbitration, surely, in those circumstances under Sub-section (1, vii.). He then has the right to compensation under the Local Government Act of 1888, either because he relinquishes his office, because you have offered him unsuitable work, or because his services are dispensed with for reasons other than misconduct or incapacity. Obviously, misconduct or incapacity would not come in there, and he is entitled to compensation, because you have abolished his office, or offered him unsuitable work. He then gets arbitration on the basis which lays down the compensation, and it was to bring it in under that that this method of drafting was adopted. It gives you the recognised basis. It is applied to all the servants of all local authorities, and it is actuarially an annuity equal to l-60th of the then salary of the man for each year of his service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>An HON. MEMBER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It must not exceed two-thirds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the maximum of one-sixtieth. It is undoubtedly under that Clause that a man, who is unreasonable, asked to transfer and says he will not do it, can claim. There is no power, as far as I know, for a Minister to do anything, after taking possession, where the refusal is not unreasonable. We are, of course, talking of what can be done. But this is a two years' provision. It is not permanent. It refers to the time when these undertakings may be taken possession of. It is only for the two years. It is inconceivable that any Minister would be so foolish as to abolish a man's office because he refused to transfer. You do not want unwilling people working in your offices if you can employ them elsewhere. To abolish a man's office under the circumstances might be quite an unreasonable thing. If he is giving valuable service where he is it certainly would be. You would not want to bring him to an office in London for the mere sake of removing him. This is a two years' provision only. I would ask my hon. and learned Friend to remember that! It does not really raise a question like that which he has mentioned of moving a man from Cornwall to Newcastle. The big railway companies, moreover, will still be managing the railways, and so long as the companies are in
	<span class='label label-info column'>1040</span>
control and supervising their own staff matters will go on much as at present. Therefore it does not raise the question, say, of the transference of a North-Western official or clerk to the Midland; it only provides for their transference to the Ministry. It is a small thing. It is conceivable that in Whitehall they should do some such work as number taking or making special investigations, or it might be the case of a specially selected servant, or the promotion of some new transport undertaking which would be established under the Bill; but it is inconceivable that there should be any difficulty in the main.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WATERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see that there is a likelihood of this thing arising as has been suggested. The Minister-designate has said that it would hardly be possible to move a man from where the hon. and learned Member for Twickenham stated, from Cornwall to Newcastle. I admit that that is quite an extreme case, and it is not likely to occur; but I have known cases where men have only been moved a distance of twenty miles. The man, say, has been offered a better post with two or three shillings a week more. In all probability the Minister-designate will have cases of the kind in his mind in his own experience. Take the man who is given an advance of two or three shillings a week, and shifted from one signal box to another that may be only 20 miles away. He considers, all things being equal, and taking into account his domestic circumstances, that such a move is distinctly detrimental.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend will permit me to interrupt him may I say that sort of transfer is carried out to-day by the railways themselves, and will be continued to be so carried out. We are talking of transfers to the Ministry. We are not talking of transfers from one signal box to another. It is, as my hon. Friend knows, one of the conditions of service on every railway, that a man shall work in his grade where he is told to work. In every case these things receive the consideration which is due to them. There may be cases of hardship. I do not know. But in most cases I should think there is no hardship at all. At any rate, there is no intention of altering that at all. The transfers as between station and station, office and office, and signal-box and signal-box on the railway will continue exactly the same as they have always done. They are not transferred to the Ministry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander DAWES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In respect to the second arbitration paragraph in this new Clause at the end of Sub-section (1), the proposal is, as I understand, to have one general arbitration Clause. Supposing there is a dispute as to whether a man comes within this customary Clause, is he to be driven to the Law Courts, or how is the matter to be settled? I think it is a stronger point, still, in passing the Amendment to have a general arbitration Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that point may I answer my hon. Friend, who suggests that where the undertaking, be it a dock company, a railway company, or any other, has been in the habit of making certain allowances to its servants that we should make these allowances statutory and impose arbitration. This Clause we put in to provide that the Minister should not undertake to interfere with or alter the customs of the various companies. I venture to think that the Committee would hesitate very considerably before they would, in a Bill of this kind, alter the position from a State point of view and impose arbitration on the companies and their employes for what they have been doing 	<i>ex gratia</i> and now has become customary. Arbitration is introduced there; it is introducing an entirely new factor into the domestic concerns of the undertakings where it has been the custom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LINDSAY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would wish to call attention to paragraph (vii.), which mentions the Local Government Act of 1888. This Bill applies to the whole of the United Kingdom. I want to ask how this will apply to Ireland? A similar provision in the Local Government Act of 1888 gives arbitration. It seems to me a different state of affairs is set up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SWAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We think our Amendment here will meet the exigencies anticipated. If this Amendment is accepted it covers all the exigencies which may occur, because this is a Bill which is likely to involve sweeping changes that no one to-day is able to apprehend. Whatever exigencies may happen, where loss is sustained, then we have the machinery here that will meet the situation. It is machinery which exists in the organisations as between employers and men, which enables us to get over difficulties which otherwise would cause a great amount of irritation. If the officers and men affected by this Bill realise that in
	<span class='label label-info column'>1042</span>
the event of their having grievances they can present them before a board where there can be reasonable discussion, then the whole system may work smoothly; otherwise if they feel they are not going to have their cases fully considered by such a board as we are seeking to set up, then we can expect there will be a big loss, and there will not be that confidence that we think is essential to the success of this concern. I hope the Minister will see his way to accept this Amendment, and so adopt such machinery for the benefit of all classes concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WATERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1, iii), after the word "fund" ["or superannuation fund established "] to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or by customary practice."</p></blockquote>
I understand the right hon. Gentleman has accepted the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not, but we will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WATERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then I formally move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment is merely carrying out the spirit of the Bill. I think that will be obvious to the Committee. It is simply bringing in words similar to those which have been brought in elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move in Sub-section (1, iii) to leave out the word "such" ["such reasonable allowances"]. This Amendment must be read in conjunction with subsequent Amendments by which I desire to leave out the words "as the Minister with the consent of the Treasury may determine." That will make the Clause read
	<br><blockquote><p>"he shall be entitled to receive reasonable allowances for temporary disturbances."</p></blockquote>
My reason for moving these Amendments is that I do not think it is fair that the Minister should be the judge of what is a reasonable allowance. I think it ought to be decided by arbitration. This is a big power to leave in the hands of the Minister. I am sure my right hon. Friend will agree with me. In other words, as the proposed Clause of the Minister now stands, he is the judge of what is reasonable, with the consent of the Treasury. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1043</span>
say that is not a power that we ought to ask for, or that he should be given. Am I right in my interpretation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am subject to the correction of the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really think the hon. Member for Dumbarton is unduly apprehensive. This Clause, as I read it, is an enabling Clause providing that the Treasury and the Minister may make certain payments. We are allowed to contribute to the superannuation fund and to make certain payments to these officers or servants who are transferred, but they cannot be transferred without their consent, and so the man who is invited to transfer says, "What are the terms if I have to come and live in London?" There are a few who have been transferred already in an informal way, and the first question they ask is, "In London what allowances am I to get?" This enables the Minister or someone acting for him to decide what he will allow for temporary expenses if the officer is removed temporarily, but that officer need not go unless he wants to. Therefore, what is the object of having an arbitration to decide what a man may accept if he comes to London?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to take up the time of the Committee, but it is so difficult in reading all these Sections and Sub-sections to get to know the real meaning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I move this Amendment on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham
	<span class='label label-info column'>1044</span>
(Mr. Joynson-Hicks). I understand these words are necessary, and that the Minister is prepared to accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government cannot accept this Amendment, because it is entirely foreign to the whole trend of the Bill which is not to indulge in general legislation which this Amendment affects to do. Under the Act of 1871, certain things could be done and certain people were awarded certain protection. It is quite true in the Act labour was not protected, but now I think that it is foreign to the whole trend of our discussion to begin to import special provisions of that kind and safeguards against other enactments, and place them into this Bill. This compensation Clause is designed to protect the officers and servants from anything which this Bill does, but to bring in a further protection for anything done under some other enactment is foreign to the purpose of this Bill, and I hope it will not be pressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander DAWES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anyone who is affected by the provisions of this Bill is, I think, thoroughly and adequately protected, but if they are in a difficult or disadvantageous position under any other enactment, then I cannot say. As regards the individuals in the Railway Clearing House who have been displaced, that may be on account of the Act of 1871, and I cannot say that they are protected here, but for the satisfaction of my right hon. Friend I would like the Committee to know what I have done. I have been in conference with the railway companies, and so far as they can, they are taking care of any servants who may be displaced, and I do not think there is any need for this provision because they can be absorbed, but they are not protected against anything under the Act of 1871.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain GUINNESS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, to leave out paragraph (v.).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why it is there. It may be because I am rather stupid, but I wish the Minister to give us some explanation. The whole of this Clause is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1045</span>
intended to protect the servants, and I want to ask is this paragraph necessary. In the case of a company or an undertaking this power to abolish an office might be very dangerous. The Minister may be perfectly reasonable, but I hope the prospective holder of this office will give us some indication as to what is meant. I suppose it would not prevent the Minister abolishing the general managership of some undertaking and keeping that man with a retaining fee in case at the end of two years the Government and Parliament decided to hand the undertaking back to them. I hope I have made my point clear. From the point of view of the company it seems to me that you are taking yet another power which may be used in quite a different way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite understand the point of view of my hon. Friend as to the question he puts as to whether there would be anything to prevent any company retaining by a retaining fee or full salary an officer or servant whose office has been abolished. There would be nothing to prevent them doing that at their own expense, but not at the expense of the State. The sort of case we had in mind when this Clause was drafted was this: The whole spirit of the country in transportation has not been towards the elimination of inter-company competition both in service and canvassing. That is the one salient point we get out of the very interesting first Report of the Committee on Transportation which sat in the last Parliament. The Committee will remember that the Minister is the medium through which the company is acting. If the Minister decides that canvassing is unnecessary it ought to be within his right to say that the canvassers' offices in Birmingham and Manchester are to be closed. It may be necessary in certain other towns that they should be retained, because there will be still competition with coastwise transportation, but there must be some point where he can say I want those offices abolished. Compensation for the servants is provided for under the Clause we have been considering, but if there was such a case of a very valuable officer who was rendered redundant by an order of the Minister there is nothing to prevent the company retaining him, and it can only be for two years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. E. CECIL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. Friend was very well advised to ask for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1046</span>
an explanation of this matter, and I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman has given it. It seems to me that there is just the danger, and I do not say more than that, that the right hon. Gentleman's successor might perpetrate some anomaly or injustice which required to be dealt with, and it would become very inconvenient under this proposal. I admit that the likelihood is remote, and after all, as the right hon. Gentleman has just said, the Clause is necessary for certain purposes. Under these conditions I would ask my hon. Friend to withdraw his Amendment, and I hope that the Committee will agree to that course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GILBERT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to know whether paragraph (v.) would equally apply to Harbour and Dock Trusts. Under this paragraph, would the Minister have the power to instruct an Harbour Trust or a Port Authority to get rid of an engineer or a manager? It seems to me to bear that interpretation. If that is so, I hope the right hon. Gentleman will consider some words to protect us for two years. The paragraph says
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Minister may direct that the office or situation of any existing officer or servant which he deems unnecessary shall be abolished."</p></blockquote>
I presume that will apply to any undertaking dealt with under this Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The report of the Departmental Committee recommended that provision should be introduced for compensation for loss of any superannuation or pension fund benefit. We want to include definitely in the Clause compensation to any officer or servant for any loss of prospective superannuation or retiring allowance. Men may be dispensed with at a time when they are qualifying for higher superannuation. In consequence of some redundancy of officers they may suffer through the operations of this Ministry, and we want this Amendment, providing when the compensation is fixed that a man shall receive compensation on account of being automatically debarred from qualifying for a higher superanuation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment provides that the prospective superannuation or other retiring allowance which has not so far been earned shall be added to the compensation. It is adding something to compensation which has already been assessed as an annuity of one-sixtieth of the retiring salary for every year of service. It brings in an entirely new factor in compensating servants who have been displaced. It duplicates the compensation, and we cannot possibly accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WATERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman cannot accept this Amendment. There are many men in the railway service who know that there is little likelihood of their being removed, and who, as a consequence, have made preparations for what is generally known as a rainy day. Offers have been made by various companies of superannuation if they will agree to pay so much per week, and many men have accepted such offers and have paid their contributions week by week out of their wages. Surely, if they are going to be removed by this Bill, some compensation should be paid to them in respect of their prospective</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>superannuation? There is a great responsibility resting upon those in charge of this Bill to see that this Amendment is included. These offers have not been put forward, not by any trade union leader, but by and on behalf of the companies and the companies' officials, and I maintain that it is the duty of the Minister to insert these words with a view of giving these men compensation for their prospective superannuation and retiring allowance.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can quite see that difficulties are likely to occur if this Amendment is pressed. It may be that if a man continued for another five or ten years his position would be improved, but that occurs in the ordinary course of business. If a man continued in business for a longer period possibly he would be able to earn more and provide better for himself and his family, but if he has not earned the money he cannot get it. I cannot see how you can possibly give additional superannuation to anybody on what one may call a prospective basis. There are certain circumstances, such as ill-health, under which it is necessary for a man to be retired, and in many municipalities a certain number of years are added in such circumstances. I presume the Government will have that power in specific cases, but if you insert this Amendment you make it obligatory to calculate what an officer may eventually be able to earn and add it to the amount of the regular superannuation. My hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens cannot have considered this Amendment as clearly as he does the majority of Amendments, and I hope he will not press it, because I do not think that he will get that amount of support that he would have received for his previous Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WIGNALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We considered, this being an addition to the Clause (	<i>b</i>), that it would have to be dealt with on its merits after the other matters had been disposed of. We may have been mistaken, and you can pity our ignorance, but the fact remains that we did think that you would take this addition to the Clause entirely on its merits and apart from anything else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable sympathy with the hon. Member. I have been in the same position myself in years gone by, but the Chair has to obey precedent and put the Question according to the rules of order. As a matter of fact, I did put the Question in that way, and it was negatived. It is impossible to move the Amendment now, because of a previous misunderstanding. If we discussed and approved of these words and added them we should have a Bill which proposed two contradictory ways of doing the same thing. It must, therefore, be left to hon. Members to try on the Report stage to repair the defects of the present position. I cannot rule the Amendment in order, because it has been discussed and decided on the Amendment moved by the hon. Member for St. Helens (Mr. Sexton).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree that in the ordinary event it would be out of order, but my hon. Friends behind me, by some misconception, were under the impression that their Amendment was accepted. I am sure you would be the last to do anyone an injustice in this Committee, and we want to thrash this point out as far as we possibly can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have got to obey the Rules of Order. I believe I have obeyed them, and I must ask the hon. Member to accept my decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the order of procedure may be for tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member puts that point I think we might get the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I venture to draw your attention to the fact that it is past one. o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope hon. Members will not insist upon adjourning until we have taken the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall want to discuss this matter on the question of the Clause standing part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in the hands of the Committee, but we have got to the end of the Amendments, and I think we might take the Clause before we adjourn. I have no desire to rule against the Amendment of the hon. Members of the Labour party, or to put them in an unfair position, but an Amendment having been defeated I have no power to allow it to be proposed in other words or to be re-discussed. I hope hon. Members will not visit their displeasure with my ruling on the Committee, but will allow the right hon. Gentleman to get the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SWAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a precedent where, when owing to inadvertance there was a mistranslation of the opinion of the Committee, it went back in order that the opinion of the Committee might be properly translated. That occurred last week on the Motion of the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Joynson-Hicks), and I think the same should apply to this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry, but I am advised, and I am well aware, that the hon. Member is not right. There is
	<span class='label label-info column'>1052</span>
no precedent for going back. There is only one way of dealing with the difficulty, and that is on the Report Stage. I am extremely sorry, but I hope the hon. Member will understand that it is not in my power to do what he wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that there are one or two things that we want to discuss, and, as it is now past the time for adjourning, I think it would be inadvisable for us to pass this Clause. I hope in the circumstances that you will allow it to be left over. It is necessary that we should discuss the arbitration Clause. If you will say that the Committee now stands adjourned I will not continue, but, if not, I shall be obliged to discuss the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of great importance to know the order of procedure. I suspect that the compensation Clause will come on for discussion tomorrow, and we were hoping that the Home Secretary with his legal knowledge would be here. The wagon people are all ready, and it would be a great convenience if the wagon Clause could be taken tomorrow first thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee stands adjourned. Perhaps the hon. Member will arrange the matter privately with the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Adjourned at One o'clock until Tomorrow (Wednesday) at Eleven a.m.</p>
