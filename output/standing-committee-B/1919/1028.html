	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps before we begin the business I might be allowed to express in the name of the Committee the deep regret we all feel at the death of one of the Members of this Committee (Lieut.-Commander Norman Craig) who had taken a most active part in the proceedings of this Committee, and to express our deep sympathy with his relatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>SITTINGS OF THE COMMITTEE.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also feel that I must consult the Committee about the meetings. I have had an intimation from the Government that they wish us to proceed as quickly as possible in order to get this Bill through the Committee stage. I shall do my best, but I feel that the matter is in the hands of the Committee themselves. As far as I can see, the remainder of the Bill is more or less machinery, and the Clauses we have already taken up to Clause 7 are the contentious and critical parts of the Bill. I hope that we shall be able to make quicker progress with the remaining parts of the Bill than we did with the first seven Clauses. I am reluctant to ask the Committee to sit in the afternoon, as I know the inconvenience of that course both to Ministers and to individual Members. What I propose to do this week is to only ask the Committee, to sit in the mornings; then we will see what progress we make, and if after that I form the opinion that the progress is not sufficiently quick, I am afraid I shall have to ask the Committee next week to sit in the afternoon. I should deprecate that for many reasons, but perhaps some Member of the Committee may be able to assist me by suggestions in regard to this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>375</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The SECRETARY of STATE for the HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. Shortt)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Government feel, indeed the Whips have told me, that it is essential that we should get through this Bill as quickly as we possibly can, and I am quite sure, without any rushing of any portion of the Bill, the Committee is also very anxious to get through the Bill as quickly as possible. We have made a calculation, as far as that is possible, because you can never say with certainty how long the Debate on any particular Amendment will take, or when any subject that will take a long time may crop up, but as far as we can prophesy, we have calculated that we shall probably require eighteen, sittings of two hours each to complete the Committee stage. If we sit in the mornings on three days a week, assuming that eighteen sittings is the correct number, we estimate that it would take us until the first week in December before we could complete the Bill, but if we could put in even one extra sitting a week, either by sitting on Monday morning or on one afternoon, making four instead of three sittings per week, we should be able then to get through some time about the 25th November, which would just give us time to get the Bill through the Report stage and Third Reading, and this would enable us to send it up to another place. Therefore, I would ask the Committee, having regard to the pressing necessities of time, if they can see their way to do it, to put in at least four sittings instead of three each week. Whether it would be more convenient to sit on Monday morning or one afternoon is entirely a matter for the Committee, but I would ask them if possible to put in four sittings instead of three each week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. BALFOUR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After this week?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chairman has ruled for three sittings this week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite appreciate the necessity for getting this Bill through, but I have yet to learn that there is a stereotyped time in which a Committee on an important Bill can exactly calculate when they can get through. The Home Secretary has suggested that we should meet on Monday morning, but he would be the first to realise that to many hon. Members living in the country it is impossible to get down here in order to be present at a Monday morning meeting by 11 o'clock. My right hon. Friend suggests four days a week, but that would mean meeting on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless you meet on one afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my right hon. Friend will make it definite, and say that he will be satisfied if we meet in the afternon after Question Time and not during Question Time, that would he more satisfactory, and we might meet from 4 to 6 o'clock. If that suggestion will overcome the difficulty, I think many members of this Committee would fall in with the suggestions made by the Home Secretary. I do hope, however, that the right hon. Gentleman will not press the question with regard to sitting on four mornings. We do not want to say that we cannot do it, but such a course would be most inconvenient to a large number of Members. If we had one meeting in the afternoon from 4 to 6 then I feel sure that the majority of the Members of this Committee will be ready to fall in with the wishes of the Home Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel W. THORNE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us get on with the Bill; we are wasting time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support what my hon. and gallant Friend (Sir F. Hall) has said. I would not like us to sit on Monday morning because that would be very inconvenient to many Members of the Committee. I may say that I am as anxious as the Home Secretary to expedite the progress of this Bill. I am sure the whole Committee is very anxious to get it through, and I know no quarter in which there is the slightest desire to protract these proceedings. I hope the Home Secretary will not press us to sit on Monday mornings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have pressed nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the right hon. Gentleman will not ask us to sit on Monday morning, but we might sit on Monday afternoon, which, I think; would he very much more convenient than Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday afternoons, which are the principal days of the Parliamentary week, and that would give us four sittings per week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is all I have asked for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman did not suggest Monday afternoon, but Monday morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or any afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest it should not be an afternoon on a day when we sit in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>377</span>
morning. If the Home Secretary will fall in with that I think the Committee would give him all the time he wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir FORTESCUE FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise for the purpose of moving a specific resolution, that we sit on one afternoon of the same three days that we sit in the morning. I do not agree with my hon. Friend that we ought to partially occupy four days by attendance here, because that means that some of us might be very much inconvenienced, although we can suit the convenience of my hon. Friend as well as anyone else. In order to bring the matter to a point I move "That the Committee sit from 11 to I on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, and from 4 to 6 on one of these afternoons, as may be arranged from time to time."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think this a matter for the Chairman, in connection with the Government officials, to settle. I do not know whether the Committee would be willing to leave it in my hands in that way. I think it would be better if they would. What I propose is that this week we meet only in the mornings, and I shall see how the Committee get on with the business. Then I could decide next week with the Home Secretary whether it is necessary to exceed the three mornings. If it be, I understand the feeling of the Committee is that on one of the days on which we sit in the morning we should also sit in the afternoon. Probably Wednesday would be most convenient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope it will be left as you. Sir, suggest without going into the question raised by the Motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I withdraw that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday there is an enormous number of Special Committees, and I think Monday afternoon would be a great deal better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PERSONAL EXPLANATION (MR. MARRIOTT).</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I refer to a personal matter which arose at the close of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V003P0I0190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>378</span>
our last sitting. It is of very considerable importance in regard to procedure and it will arise as a question of very great importance when we reach the later stages of the Bill. If the misunderstanding could be cleared up now I believe it would very much expedite our proceedings at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have called Clause 8 and the strict business is to go on with the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a personal explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But you want a reply from someone?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be glad to hear what the Home Secretary has to say on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member can only go on with the indulgence of the Committee. If the Committee is willing that he should make any remarks I will not stop him, but strictly he is out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Clause 7 I moved what I think I may describe as the most important Amendment on the whole Bill. It referred to the question of compensation to companies which are bought out. A few minutes before the close of the sitting I was called away, but before going I spoke to the Home Secretary in regard to an Amendment which was on the paper in his name. I allowed my own Amendment to be negatived without a division on the understanding, as I gathered, that the Home Secretary would move his Amendment. I should have pressed my Amendment to a division if that understanding had not, as I believed, been clearly arrived at between him and me. An Amendment moved by the hon. Member (Mr. G. Balfour) was accepted and the Home Secretary's was never moved. That being so I shall have to ask permission to reserve my full liberty of action when the Bill comes to Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That follows as a matter of course. The hon. Member can raise anything on the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want there to be any misunderstanding about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to be quite sure whether the hon. Member is casting
	<span class='label label-info column'>379</span>
any reflection upon my good faith, because it sounded very like it. Why the matter is raised this morning I cannot imagine. I told him yesterday that I had no recollection of any such conversation. I told him that the moment I tabled my own Amendment I knew it was one the House of Commons would not accept when we got below and I must get rid of it somehow. When the hon. Member (Mr. G. Balfour) put his Amendment to me I said "I need not move mine" and he said "Of course not." That is my position. I should really like to know whether the hon. Member means to cast any reflection on my good faith or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I desire to cast no reflection whatever on the Home Secretary's good faith, but I cast some reflection on his memory. I think he has forgotten in the interval what actually took place. I want in the most formal manner to remind him of what took place in order that I may make use of it in another place. It is extremely important that the point should be on record because I left this Committee room in my own mind with a distinct understanding that the Home Secretary's Amendment would be moved. My hon. Friend's (Mr. G. Balfour's) Amendment was not on the paper and the Home Secretary's was. The Home Secretary now says he was very anxious to get rid of it,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That makes me convinced that I never gave that promise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, of course, is a matter for the Home Secretary to determine whether he desired to support his own Amendment or not, but it was on the understanding, as I believed it, that that Amendment would be moved that I allowed my own to be negatived.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Member ought to go on with his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, after the word "board" ["Where a district electricity board"] to insert the words "or any authorised undertakers."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Home Secretary will agree that this is really no more than a drafting Amendment. Some authorised undertakers have powers, by Provisional Order under the Electric Lighting Acts, to acquire or to use land for generating stations. It is essential that these powers should be fully preserved in this Bill for the benefit and in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V003P0I0191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>380</span>
the interests of the district boards which will come into being and also of the undertakers, who in certain cases will be in a position of district boards, and further, it is very important that there should be no doubt whatever about the equality of the powers in the two cases. As I propose to amend the Clause by this and a succeeding Amendment the word "order" covers orders under the Electric Lighting Acts, and therefore it seems necessary to add the other words to show that the provisions of the Electric Lighting Acts and the Electricity Supply Bill are intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was rather surprised to hear the hon. Member describe this as a mere drafting Amendment. It is a matter of very serious consequence, but the Committee may think it right. The object of the whole thing is to get rid of actions for nuisance, injunctions, and so on. If you are going to apply it, as you might very well, to existing undertakings, it ought clearly only to apply to orders which are made after the passing of the Bill. I do not think, where orders are now in existence as to which the public have certain rights, those public rights should be taken away. If after the word "order" the hon. Member would include the words "made after the passing of this Act," it would apply equally to district electricity boards or to authorised undertakers in respect of any order made after the passing of this Bill. It would have no retrospective effect and would not take away from the public rights which they at present possess and would deal simply with the future. If those words are inserted I should ask the Committee to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very glad indeed to accept that Amendment on the understanding that both my Amendments—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the other stands by itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MARRIOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well, I accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BALFOUR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move after the word "by" ["are authorised by Order"] to insert the word "special."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Clause stands, by an Order which is not clearly defined in any part of the Bill, arbitrary powers are given to the Electri-
	<span class='label label-info column'>381</span>
city Commissioners, and there is absolutely no remedy on the part of any interested party against the arbitrary use of those powers. The object I have in suggesting the insertion of the word "special" is that the definition of "special Order" given in Clause 40 gives the protection, to the various interested parties, of proper inquiry, and their representations can be made as against the arbitrary powers which are conferred if we leave the word "Order" only.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether my hon. Friend appreciates that his Amendment is really defeating his own end. There is no power to make any Order except that which the Bill provides. If you put in "special Order" here you involve a weaker protection for the public in respect of an Order made under Sub-section (8) of Clause 5. If the Electricity Commissioners make an Order including in their scheme some power to take land, instead of having procedure by Sub-section (8) of Clause 5, they would be confined to the procedure of the special Order, which is rather weaker. In the case of a special Order you lay it on the Table of the House and it automatically comes into force unless the House pass a resolution against it. In the case of Sub-section (8) of Clause 5 you lay it on the Table of the House, but it does not come into force until the House have said it shall do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BALFOUR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the protection to the people whose land is to be acquired? I am not looking at this entirely from the point of view of the party wishing to acquire the land. There are two interests to be protected—the interests of the electric supply concerned and the interests of the public at large, the owner of the land. What remedy has the owner of the land got if by special Order under Sub-section (8) of Clause 5 he finds an Order has been made in respect of his land and that no inquiry has been held to hear his representations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the point. Suppose there is a special Order and it lies on the table of the House. If nobody draws attention to it, it comes automatically into force, but in the case of an Order made under Sub-section (8) of Clause 5, the Order does not come into force until someone moves a Resolution putting it into force. That would draw the attention of the public and of the landowner to it. Of course, the protection of the public is in the procedure with regard to the owner. That is the only protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>382</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BALFOUR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under an Order, as against a special Order, is it necessary for the Commissioners to publish all the particulars referred to in the Schedule to this Bill, which they have to publish under Clause 40 before making a special Order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There it is; I have explained it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BALFOUR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman say that the members of the public owning land have exactly the same rights as they would have under a special Order, of having evidence heard before the special Order is made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the same. I think the other is stronger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. CHAMBERLAIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the word "special" were put in before "Order" it would not make it compulsory that a special Order be made in order to enable Boards to use or acquire the land. All it would do would be to deprive the board of the special protection given by this Clause, except where an Order was made a special one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is so, and the "special Order" is not so strong as the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

	<div class='clause'>CLAUSE 9.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(Restrictions on the establishment of new generating stations.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>9. Notwithstanding anything in any special Act or order in force at the passing of this Act, it shall not be lawful for any authority, company, or person, except a district electricity board, to establish a new or extend an existing generating station without the consent of the Electricity Commissioners, but this restriction shall not apply to the establishment or extension of a private generating station provided that the owner thereof complies with any regulations made by the Electricity Commissioners as to the type of current, frequency, and pressure to be used:
	<br><blockquote><p>Provided that, where a group of persons carrying on or intending to carry on businesses in which large quantities of
	<span class='label label-info column'>383</span>
electricity are used for purposes other than for provision of mechanical power or light propose to establish a generating station for the purposes of such businesses, the Electricity Commissioners may authorise the establishment by or on behalf of those consumers of a generating station, subject to the condition that any surplus electricity generated shall be supplied to the district electricity board, or any authorised undertakers, or any other authority, company, or person, at such prices as the Electricity Commissioners may think fit and proper, and may authorise the exercise of such other powers (including the breaking up of roads, railways, and tramways) as may be necessary for the purpose, and where such an authority is given the generating station shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as though it were a private generating station.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move to leave out the words "except a district electricity board" ["company, or person, except a district electricity board, to establish a new or extend an existing"].
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think probably the Committee will be of opinion that as the Electricity Commissioners are to have full control over such matters as the extension of old or establishment of new private generating stations this should apply to a board as well as to anyone else.

As to the construction of new and the extension of existing generating stations the Committee have agreed, I think, by accepting the last Amendment that they should be under the control of the Electricity Commissioners. If this power is limited to one year it means that it is really of no avail. Why make a limit at all? I cannot see the object of it.

Comissioners being carried out. I think my hon. Friend will see that if you limit the time, unless it is a very long time indeed, which would not be a limit at all, it might interfere largely with the whole scheme of the Electricity Commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the suggestion of a limitation of three years is a very reasonable one. The Electricity Commissioners have the entire decision as to whether there shall be any new generating stations and any development of existing stations. Take the case of dock generating stations. The Committee have decided in Clause 7 to include the words "dock generating stations." That is a rather particular position. As the Bill stands, in some places it is included and in some places it is excluded. I can quite see that big industries, the Manchester Ship Canal, the Port of London Authority, and all these places are going to be precluded, because, in regard to the generating stations of these undertakings, we do not know exactly how we stand. I hope the Home Secretary will appreciate that we do not want these big industries handicapped unnecessarily. I am sure he wishes to see them go ahead. The feeling of the Committee has been that dock generating stations should be treated the same as private generating stations, but as the Bill stands they would be seriously handicapped unless there is some limit of time put in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CHAMBERLAIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot help thinking that this Amendment has been moved under a misapprenhension. It has been urged that it was undesirable to prolong the powers given to certain bodies to break up roads and tramways. This Amendment has nothing whatever to do with that. The matter before the Committee relates to any extension of what I might call the public supply of electricity. Is the public supply of electricity to be under central control or not? I thought we had agreed it was. If you say it is to be under public control for a period of only a year, two years, or three years, you are giving up the principle of the whole Bill. The hon. Member who last spoke was on a different point altogether. The question of private generating stations, to be owner or set up by docks, will come a little later on. I really think that the speeches made have been made under entire misapprehensions as to the meaning of this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this goes through without a time limit there will be a prohibition against docks dealing as they desire with
	<span class='label label-info column'>385</span>
their generating stations. We do not know whether they are going to be treated as private generating stations or not. Therefore we want some limit in the Bill. I know that this conies in in another place as well, but this is the first time that I have got the opportunity of pressing the matter. I hope that my right hon. Friend will see its importance. For instance, he can indicate that the Amendment of Clause 7 in this respect is to be accepted. This would save the time of the Committee. There are many Amendments which I shall have to press unless this is going to be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move after the word "but" ["but this restriction"] to. insert the words '' such consent shall not be refused unless a local inquiry has been held and "
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a large number of representations that the Electricity Commissioners may without adequate knowledge, or what the owners at any rate think adequate knowledge, prohibit the establishment of new generating stations or the extension of old ones and be prejudicial to trade. Therefore I propose the insertion of these words, which I suggest will be sufficient protection for the electrical trade and will ensure that enterprising individuals will not be thwarted unduly in carrying on their business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount ELVEDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an Amendment to the proposed Amendment, after the word "held'' to insert the words "in manner provided by this Act in the case of special Orders."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am informed that it is not quite certain what form of inquiry there shall be in the case of special Orders. It is rather important, especially from the railway companies' point of view, to know what is the reason for refusing to allow a railway company to electrify its system or be responsible for providing for carrying out its functions. It is therefore essential to get these words put in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provision with regard to special Orders is a provision with regard to an inquiry held by the Board of Trade, and is a more elaborate process than the mere inquiry as to whether a certain generating station should be extended or a certain undertaking should be allowed to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V003P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>386</span>
build a new generating station in a different place. The inquiry would be an inquiry such as the Electricity Commissioners would hold. Either one of the Electricity Commissioners would hear all the evidence, view the place and see the surroundings, or send some competent electrical engineer to represent him. I do not think it necessary to encumber them with the elaborate process such as is necessary under the inquiry in the case of Special Orders. In such a case the persons wishing to extend their concerns would apply for permission to the Electricity Commissioners to do so. The Electricity Commissioners would say, "We do not think the permission should be given," and they would give, reasons. An inquiry would be held, the Electricity Commissioners would say to whoever hold the inquiry all that they had got to say. One inquiry might require a great deal more evidence and viewing, and so on, than another inquiry, and therefore I ask my noble Friend not to press his Amendment to mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount ELVEDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is only to be held in case of a refusal. Railway companies feel very much their responsibility for providing possible extensions. They are providing a public service. If the public service is held up in a hole-and-corner manner by some future occupant of the office of Electricity Commissioner, it would be very unsatisfactory if there was any doubt as to whether it had been properly considered or not. If the Electricity Commissioners allow the extension to take place, nobody wants an inquiry. But if they refuse it, it is an important thing to lay down that it should be a real inquiry and have some form such as is laid down by this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had shown that this takes place only in case of refusal. When it is refused they persist and demand an inquiry, which they get. Is it really necessary, in the case of that inquiry, that the Board of Trade shall publish in such manner as they think best adapted for informing persons affected—who know all about it—of the refusal, and that they shall give public notice of where copies of the refusal can be seen and to allow any person within 21 days to make objections—all objections to be in writing—stating the specific grounds of objection and any omissions, additions, or modifications to the refusal that are asked for. They are required also to consider any complaint made by any person appearing to be affected sent in with-
	<span class='label label-info column'>387</span>
in the required time. Then they appoint a competent impartial person to hold the inquiry with regard to the Order. It has to be held in public, and any person affected by the refusal is entitled to appear at the inquiry either in person or by counsel, solicitor, or an agent, and all these proceedings have to be conducted in accordance with rules made by the Board of Trade, and so on. When it is purely a question as to whether some company is to extend its generating station, I do not think it is necessary to go through all that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount ELVEDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am told that the gravamen of the Amendment which I have moved is contained in the proviso that the Board of Trade may appoint a competent and impartial person to hold an inquiry with regard to an Order and to report to them thereon, so that it shall be a real inquiry. Obviously my right hon. Friend has set out a lot of things that are absolutely unnecessary, but it is, in our opinion, most important to lay down this principle, as this is going on for all time, and that we may be perfectly satisfied that the inquiry will be by some competent and impartial person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I appreciate now what my noble Friend had in mind. It is not the form of the inquiry but that the inquiry should be held by an impartial arbitrator instead of by the people who had already made the refusal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount ELVEDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would not be so by this necessarily at all, because it would simply provide that the procedure was to be the same as that which was for special order. I see the point; I will not make any promise about it, but I will be very happy to meet my noble Friend between this and the Report stage and discuss the matter with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been already accepted by the Committee in an Amendment to Clause 7, and therefore I do not suppose that there will be any question as to the acceptance of this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V003P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>388</span>
Amendment also. If it is not accepted, we shall have in one part of the Bill a dock generating station treated as a private generating station and in another part of the Bill it will not be treated in that manner. The Bill in that case would not be in a complete form. I hope, therefore, although I think that my right hon. Friend rather indicated an antipathy to the inclusion of dock generating stations as private generating stations, that he will on reflection agree to accept this Amendment. It is an important Amendment, because if docks are to be handicapped by not being allowed to go on building and increasing in the same manner as other private undertakings, they will not be able to provide means for the increased use of electricity which is now required in the big dock undertakings. It may be argued that in the case of dock generating stations they would be better advised to take their current from some of those other undertakings, but that would only be applicable in the case of small undertakings. With regard to large docks there cannot be any question, because it must be an advantage for them to extend in such a way as they find their trade develops. It is because that has been so thoroughly recognised that it is desired they should have what I am now proposing, and I hope my right hon. Friend will accept this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope my hon. and gallant Friend will not press this proposal. The whole object of the Bill is that the general policy with regard to electricity shall be in central hands, and there is no more reason why the central power should not have control over the establishment of new generating stations in docks just the same as in the case of railways or any other bodies specified in Clause 7, I have Amendments down which will prevent any undue restriction of extensions, and this is purely a question of local control. I hope I shall be able to satisfy my hon. and gallant Friend that those interests he has mentioned are sufficiently protected against any undue or unreasonable refusal either for the establishment of new, or the extension of old, stations. I ask the Committee to say that there ought to be the same control over dock generating stations as there will be over railway or other generating stations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. HOPKINSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to know the meaning of the term "a private generating station." Does this mean a generating station which supplies one's own house?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a definition given in Clause 41 of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to press upon the Home Secretary the fact that railways have been accepted as private concerns, and why? Simply because they do not supply current to private individuals and they utilise and generate current for their own purposes, and I maintain that the docks are on exactly the same footing as the railway concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear; and why not leave them so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman undertake to give the same facilities in every way to the docks as he is going to give to the railways? I think he overlooks the fact that that is not so. He is not giving the same conditions to the docks as to the railways. The right hon. Gentleman should recognise the fact that the dock companies do not sell their current to anybody else, and it is only for the vast number of undertakings they have got. Many of their works utilise the current to carry on their business, and surely, under the circumstances, it is as much a private undertaking as any railway. If the Home Secretary will say that he will undertake to place the docks on exactly the same footing as the railways I shall be prepared to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BALFOUR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume in any case that we still have a remedy under Clause 41 in the definition of a private generating station.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BALFOUR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can then alter the different classes of generating stations brought in. I take it that that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given notice of an Amendment after the word "that" ["provided that the owner thereof complies with any regulations made"] to insert the words "in the case of the establishment of a new private generating station." The proposal was that in any extension or establishment of a new generating station that was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V003P0I0196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>390</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a mistake in the order of the Amendments. The next Amendment is the one standing in the name of Major Cope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major COPE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Amendment of the Home Secretary be accepted I should not move my Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must take the Amendments in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major COPE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then I do not move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BALFOUR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move to leave out the words "provided that the owner thereof complies with any regulations made by the Electricity Commissioners as to the type of current, frequency, and pressure to be used."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me if those words are allowed to remain in the Bill that we shall have a very arbitrary power placed in the hands of the Electricity Commissioners and the authorities, and at the very time when we wish to stimulate trade we shall be hampering the trades and industries of the country, because it will be impossible for any plant to be installed, without a long discussion with the electricity authorities. I suggest it is in the interests of every manufacturer in the country that once a known standard is established of pressure, frequency and type to order his plant to conform to these known standards, with the single exception of that class of manufacturer who through the exigencies of his business must have a type of current, frequency and pressure different from the standard set down. I presume the answer of the right hon. Gentleman and his advisers will be that they should comply with the standard, and then put in transforming plant to comply with the standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Take the case of the Castner-Kellner Company. I do not know the amount of their plant, but it runs to something between 30,000 or 40,000 kilowatts. They require a special type of plant and current different from the standard of the national supply. What would it cost them if they were compelled by an arbitrary order to instal a plant and then transform the standard? Even to deal with the plant for 2,000 killowatts would cost £100,000, and the loss in efficiency would be quite 14 per cent. Electricity in the case of the Castner-
	<span class='label label-info column'>391</span>
Kellner Company is not merely a driving power but a raw material, and you are going to impose upon them the burden of having to spend a huge sum to convert the State-ordered current into the one which is necessary for them, and you are putting upon them in addition to this expenditure the necessity of carrying on their industry in a state of inefficiency. I think it is in the interests of all manufacturers to conform to the standards except in the case of electro-chemical and electro-metallurgical trades.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Committee will not accept this Amendment. This is a matter of the greatest importance, and goes to the root of the whole electrical schemes of this country. One of the main points that renders a central power necessary is the lack of co-operation and the lack of uniformity which has existed in the past. May I quote to the Committee what was said by the Williamson Committee, which was appointed by the Board of Trade. On page 6, paragraph 13, of that Report, it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Owing to the chaos of different systems and the absence of any attempt to standardise pressures and frequencies, cooperation between neighbouring authorities is difficult and expensive. In London, for example, there are seven railway and tramway systems which generate electricity for the purposes of traction of different frequencies—one at 50, two at 33 1/3 and four at 25—thus rendering exchange of electricity between them impracticable except at the great expense involved in converting it. Again, there are in the area of Greater London 70 authorities who supply electricity to the public and own some 70 generating stations with 50 different types of system, 10 different frequencies and 24 different voltages."</p></blockquote>
The whole object is to ensure that for the future you could get that uniformity which has been so lacking in the past, and you would thereby cheapen the supply and render it more certain by giving power to interchange between the various systems. I may remind the Committee that I have Amendments down on the Paper which, if accepted, will ensure that, at any rate, in the case of extensions of existing undertakings, there would be no undue hardship by imposing conditions that could not be carried out except at a prohibitive cost, and, therefore, the provision with regard to these powers, if my subsequent Amendment is carried, would only apply to the esablishment of new generating stations. It would only mean, where people are putting up a new generating station they would be able to say "you must construct it so as to fall into the complete
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V003P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>392</span>
system to enable electricity to be supplied as cheaply and as efficiently as possible." It will not apply to existing stations, because there, conditions might be applied which would render the scrapping of the whole plant necessary, and that would be an injustice and an unnecessary hardship. For these reasons I ask the Committee to reject this Amendment and accept the one which I shall move in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HOPKINSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Committee will not take the Home Secretary's technical instructions, because the point raised by this Amendment is a very important one, indeed. It may not be known that the vast majority of the power stations in this country will provide a three-phase electric current. There is the case of the electro-metallurgical and the electro-chemical trades.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are provided for, and you cannot provide electricity by anything but the three-phase method.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HOPKINSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You must have continuous current. The result will be that anyone who wishes to establish a new electro-chemical industry will have to generate his current or buy it from the supplying authority as three-phase current. We shall have to put it into elaborate rotary generators which will convert it into continuous current and then use it for decomposing the salt or solution we wish to decompose for our own purpose. I had a good deal to do with providing the generating plant for the Castner-Kellner Company. We generated at 200 volts continuous current using steam engines in the first place and gas engines of large size in the second. The effect of this would be that in any extension of their private generating stations Castner-Kellner would have to have a different type of generator and instead of a 200-volt current which could be applied direct to the cells this three-phase current would have to be reduced in a rotary converter and then used. One has not only to consider the cost of the conversion but also the positive loss of efficiency in the current itself. Take another point. The solution of the housing question is going to fall upon people like myself who have a bit of land and will spend their money on building houses for the working classes. I propose to supply my tenants with electric light, and being an engineer and knowing something about electricity, I am going to adopt a system which will not be the system of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>393</span>
district but will give my tenants their light at half the cost at which they would get it from the local authority, and possibly at 25 per cent. less cost than they would get it from one of the new super-generating stations. Under this Bill I shall be forbidden to do that and am to be forced to put in a private generating station on some system laid down by the Commissioners, which will result in my tenants having to pay perhaps 25 per cent. or 50 per cent. more for their electric lighting than if I supply it in the way I intend to do. The point is not one which can be brushed aside altogether. In my own village I know very much better than the Electricity Commissioners the best way of supplying electricity, and I am going to supply it on a system which no super-generating station on earth will be able to beat for cheapness. The super-generating stations for the most part will be only electricity-producing stations, but my own station will produce gas, and as my tenants will be supplied with electricity, the vast proportion of the heat, which will be lost in the case of the engine driven electricity generators, will go into the water, which is then going to be raised to a higher temperature to give a hot water supply. That is a thing which cannot be done in the case of your super-generating stations. Even if you are using large engines the heat that goes into the cooling water is going to be wasted. In my case it will be used. I hope the Home Secretary will consider these technical points. I do not wish to say he has been wrongly advised technically, but his technical advisers, not knowing everything, have left out of account a very large number of things which ought to be taken into account and certainly, that question of private villages, if I may term them, and the electro-chemical industry is a very important one which ought to be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, naturally we shall take into consideration, and we hope we do, such cases as that mentioned by the hon. Member where he would have a generating station for his own tenants, which will really be for that purpose and no other, and probably would only be big enough for that purpose and no other. So far as the metallurgical people are concerned and those who have waste heat which they can use for associated industries, all these are, provided for subsequently. We shall, of course, consider most carefully cases such as the hon. Member suggests, but the time for considering them is not now. The time to consider
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V003P0I0198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>394</span>
them is when you are choosing your Commissioners, because an Electricity Commissioner who imposed conditions, in such a case as that mentioned, which would prevent the hon. Member carrying out the whole purpose of his scheme would not be fit for his office. The particular case that he has mentioned is so extreme that no Commissioner, when he saw that a man on his own estate was doing something for the benefit of his own tenants, would ruin what he was doing on the off-chance that they might be able to work in with some big electrical power company to whom they would be a fleabite. That would never be done. So far as the trades that require electricity for their raw materials are concerned, they are subsequently dealt with in this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BALFOUR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot possibly allow the reply which the Home Secretary made to my remarks to remain on record without being refuted. Not a single word that the Home Secretary said was pertinent. I referred to the Williamson Report and to certain stations. These were all public generating stations authorised by Act of Parliament or Provisional Order, and not a word was said which applied to the matter before the Committee. To people not accustomed to dealing with electrical matters and not conversant with Provisional Orders or Acts of Parliament, it may have sounded a complete answer, but there was not a word in the right hon. Gentleman's reply which touched the subject, and he has not yet answered the point I put to him whether or not the Government is going to hamper the trade and industry of the country. If the Commissioners are wise and prudent, there may be no trouble at all, but we are legislating not for a year or two with Commissioners whom we may have in view at present. We have to assume that we shall have all kinds of Commissioners in future years, and we must, then, see how the public interest will be protected under this Clause. If you had a stupid Commissioner, a manufacturer of electro-chemical or electro-metallurgical processes would have no remedy and would be bound to put in something very costly and very inefficient, and up to the present the Home Secretary has given no answer to that proposition. I must press the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I read the Home Secretary's Amendment I thought it went a large way towards meeting the objections that I and others had to this Amendment, but the reply he has given has rather shaken
	<span class='label label-info column'>395</span>
my faith. He says we should not allow Electricity Commissioners to remain if they brushed aside such ideas as those mentioned by the hon. Member (Mr. Hopkinson). That seems to me where the difficulty is going to be. If Commissioners are appointed whom it is always necessary to look after and see they carry out their duties in the most efficient manner difficulties will arise. Perhaps it would be a great deal better, instead of taking the words of the right hon. Gentleman, to leave out altogether the words suggested in this Amendment. I agree that in the ordinary course of events it will be a great deal better that new generating stations should be constructed in the way suggested. I can understand some Commissioners saying "it has been stated in a Committee of the House of Commons that it is necessary that there should be uniformity of current," and that may not be of the greatest possible advantage. The right hon. Gentleman has been perfectly reasonable and has shown a desire that there should not be any trouble. Perhaps under the circumstances, having heard all the arguments, he may still be convinced that an Amendment to leave out these words would have a better effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would wreck the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to do that. I do not want always to hear, whenever Amendments are brought in of any importance, "you are going to wreck the Bill." That is not the desire of the Committee. We are here to act in co-operation and to try and assist the right hon. Gentlemen. I am sure there is nothing in what I have said which could lead anyone to the opinion that I am desirous of wrecking the Bill. I protest against that sort of thing. We are not to be told that everything we bring forward is with the idea of wrecking the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the forecasts made by some of the recent speakers were likely to happen the Committee would no doubt veto it, but they are assuming that the Commissioners will practically be devoid of all common sense in matters electrical, because surely in no such case as those which have been indicated, either the private supplier for his tenants or electrochemical work, would the Electricity Commissioners seek to establish that uniformity which may be necessary with regard to public companies dealing with the general supply of electricity. We have to give credit to the Commissioners we are going to appoint and to whom we are giving vast powers, and if they can exercise them they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V003P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>396</span>
surely can exercise their discretion in the way outlined by the Home Secretary in differentiating as to uniformity of current. It says that the stations must be subject to the control of the Commissioners but it does not say that that control is going to be in every case uniform and that currency and everything else is to be stereotyped. We can safely leave these powers to the Commissioners and they will exercise their with a certain amount of common sense and not on the lines suggested by supporters of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HOPKINSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is true and they will exercise reasonable discretion why put this provision in at all? If they are sensible men they will consult the people concerned. Presumably no one is going to put in an unsuitable plant for his own use and any intelligent and reasonable Commissioner, if there are such things, will at once consult the owner and say "why are you using this particular voltage?" Why or. earth have this absurd Clause, which gives an opportunity to a stupid or self-interested Commissioner—he may be a trade rival or anything of that sort—to step in and upset one's apple-cart in the matter of one's own generating station? It is perfectly useless. Either these Commissioners are going to act sensibly and come to the conclusion that a man knows what he wants better than they do, or else they will act foolishly, in which case they will make use of this part of the Clause. I think the Right hon. Gentleman has proved very conclusively that these words are quite unnecessary on the supposition that the Commissioners are going to be sensible people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CHAMBERLAIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reference to the interruption of the Home Secretary, to the effect that acceptance of this Amendment would wreck the Bill, I am sure my Right hon. Friend will not accuse me of any desire to wreck the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have accused nobody of a desire to wreck the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In what way does this wreck the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It takes away control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CHAMBERLAIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point I wish to traverse. The Clause begins by making it impossible for any authority which is engaged in the public supply of
	<span class='label label-info column'>397</span>
electricity to extend its establishment without the consent of the Commissioners. There is no danger there, therefore I cannot see why the Home Secretary should think that the establishment of a new private generating station, even if it did not comply in currency and pressure with the standard of the district, should carry any danger to the general principles of this Bill. I take it that for the most part manufacturers and those engaged in industry will not desire to set up their own private stations. It would mean the locking-up of capital which they could probably employ much better. If they did set up a station of their own it really means that their needs are so special that they cannot make the best use of the supply of electricity provided by the public authority. Therefore, it is probably just because it is necessary to their business that they should have a different type of current frequency or pressure, that they will desire to set up their own station. I do not see why they should not be allowed to do so. I certainly agree that it does not necessarily mean, if this Amendment is rejected, that everyone has to put up a station which conforms to the general type of current and frequency, because it is always possible for the Commissioners to give their consent to something different. It seems to me that on the whole the advantage lies in omitting the words which make it necessary for the owner to conform unless he gets consent, and that we ought rather to leave it that he may put up his own station where his requirements are such that he cannot get what he wants from the public authority. I hope the Home Secretary will reconsider this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If you eliminate these words the Commissioners have no power whatever over any private station. If you strike out the proviso, their consent is not necessary and no one will consult them at all. That removes the control absolutely. Let me say one word with regard to all these people who have private stations. It is absolutely essential for the purpose of a cheap and efficient supply that the central body should supply as many people as possible. The load factor is one of the great essentials of cheap and efficient supply. If you allow any individual to set up any sort of private station that he likes, it means that not only is he not taking his supply from the central body, but that you are reducing to that extent the load factor and the efficiency of the central body. You cannot even use his station as a potential part of the central scheme; you cannot use it in case of break-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V003P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>398</span>
down or any urgent necessity. That is absolutely essential. I am not accusing anyone of a desire to wreck the Bill, but if I think an Amendment is so serious as to wreck the Bill, it is my duty to say so. That does not involve any aspersion on anyone or impute a desire to wreck the Bill. It would go to the very root of the load factor if private individuals said: "We will have our own scheme." Unless you can have real control of all sources of supply your central body is absolutely useless. That is why I say that this is really of far more importance to the Bill than my hon. Friend appears to appreciate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BALFOUR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this matter were not so serious it would be laughable. The right hon. Gentleman talks airily about the load factor. As I told him before, if he put ten additional textile factories on one station he does not necessarily improve his load factor at all. It is absolute nonsense. I have been interested in these matters in every phase of development, and to-day I am carrying very great responsibilities to large numbers of the community. It is all very well for the right hon. Gentleman, when he feels that the argument is against him, to lie back and laugh and say "Hear, bear."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SHORTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are laughing at me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BALFOUR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You talk airily about the load factor. On the Second Reading you did so. All that you said about load factor then was utterly wrong, as it is utterly wrong to-day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. Member will not go into this, and that he will refrain from personal remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BALFOUR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last thing I desire is to say anything in any sense personal, bat I must impress upon this Committee the fact that in reply to the observations I have made the Home Secretary gave an answer which dealt with part of those Clauses already passed, namely, the companies operated by special Act and provisional Order. He said not one word about the private station. In reply to others, the right hon. Gentleman has come forward and stated how it will improve the load factor. Those are not the facts of the case. The Home Secretary has not given one substantial reason to show how, if this is omitted, it would wreck or in any way injure the Bill. I am sure the Committee will support the Home Secretary. I will support him if he shows that the omission of these words will wreck the Bill. I am willing to withdraw my Amendment if the right hon. Gentleman will
	<span class='label label-info column'>399</span>
put before the Committee solid facts as to why the Bill will be injured if these words are cut out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WADDINGTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the Amendment, particularly after the explanation given by the Home Secretary that load factor is going to be influenced by anything done under the Amendment. It really is surprising that after all the discussions which have taken place on electricity we should have the right hon. Gentleman, who is responsible for putting this Bill before the Committee, deliberately saying to the Committee that the mere fact of getting an additional load is to improve your load factor. Load factor is determined, not by the quantity, but by the length of time that that power is used. If you are going to have 100 textile mills put on you are not going necessarily to increase your load factor, but if you have 100 textile mills working on a two-shift system, then immediately you increase your load factor very considerably. In Lancashire and Yorkshire the local authorities went into the question, in connection with super-power stations, of what would be the effective saving of load factor, the gain of load factor, by amalgamation. It was shown that it would be so very immaterial that it was not worth while considering super-power stations. The Home Secretary spoke airily of co-ordination, of one frequency. But we are going to establish three frequencies. We have a 25, a 40, and a 50, and it is not yet determined that any of these is the perfect frequency A private manufacturer may have it put to him that a higher or a lower frequency will give him a lower initial capital and coal cost. But in the regulations which may be made by this proviso he would be limited in choice. I hope that in order that there may be freedom for initiative freedom for those who wish to experiment, these words may be struck out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir EVAN JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears to me, with a certain amount of technical knowledge but not with the full detail knowledge that many have, that a considerable part of the difficulty is due to the misunderstanding of terms. It has already been mentioned that the Commissioners appointed to administer this Act would exercise the ordinary functions of common sense, and undoubtedly in the great majority of cases that would be so; but, on the other hand, it does appear that the wording of this Clause limits their discretion. If that can he got over a means may be found which would meet the views of all parties. I would suggest for the consideration of the Home Secretary that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V003P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
wording of the Clause may be altered as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that the consent of the Electricity Commissioners is obtained to the type of currency, frequency and pressure to be used."</p></blockquote>
It might be said that to comply with regulations would limit the discretion of the Commissioners, that certain regulations would be framed, and that when you had a very officially-minded Commissioner he would feel himself bound by those particular terms and would not depart from the regulations, whereas if it is known that the Commissioners have a wide discretion and it is not intended to limit the development of private stations it appears to me that words of the kind I have suggested might meet the difficulties of both sides. In that event, a Commissioner who, though officially-minded, was possessed of a certain amount of common sense, would be able to deal with the matter in the way which he thought best.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount ELVEDEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me a good thing that the private station should comply with certain things. If I wanted to put up a private station, it would be just as well if the public authority helped me in the choice of my apparatus, because we are not always in the position of being able to advise ourselves. If, for example, at some future date I wanted to change an electric standard from one part of a room to another and I found that the workman who put in the last plug had put in a standard plug, it would be an advantage if I were able to move it at my discretion.

The object of the Amendment is to avoid putting an unfair restriction upon mere extensions, because it might be necessary to allow an extension of a generating station which had been built in a way which prevented it being used by a combined central authority, but at the same time it might be an undue hardship to prevent it extending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I must say that I cannot see how it would affect the load. As far as I can see, they will be able to put up private stations as long as they comply with the regulations of the Commissioners. Speaking now as a layman, who may some day want to put up such a station, I think it a very good thing to have some central authority who would guide one generally in the course of standardisation.</p>

I will do so for another reason. I recollect the powers of the Metropolitan Water Board. These gave opportunity to individuals to put down artesian wells and evade the water rate on their particular houses, with the result that expense was thrown on the other members of the community. I can see the same thing occurring in the case of these private undertakings, if they are to be allowed to put up the undertakings and not take the current from the central authority. They will require the lighting in the streets and other places; they will get all the privileges and they will evade the responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move to leave out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that, where a group of persons carrying on or intending to carry on businesses in which large quantities of electricity are used for purposes other than for provision of mechanical power or light propose to establish a generating station for the purposes of such businesses, the Electricity Commissioners may authorise the establishment by or on behalf of those consumers of a generating station, subject to the condition that any surplus electricity generated shall be supplied to the district electricity board, or any authorised undertakers, or any other authority, company, or person, at such prices as the Electricity Commissioners may think fit and proper, and may authorise the exercise of such other powers (including the breaking up of loads, railways, and tramways) as may be necessary for the purpose, and where such an authority is given the generating station shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as though it were a private generating station."</p></blockquote>
The Home Secretary, speaking earlier, referred to the necessity for co-ordinating and unifying various methods of electrical power and their extension. I submit that this paragraph is absolutely at variance with the general purpose of the Act. We have already decided in Clause 7 that all existing generating stations shall be taken over, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V003P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>404</span>
now we seek under this Clause to establish other generating stations, and the way in which the Clause is framed opens out a very big extension of the very thing which we are attempting to get rid of by this Bill. I submit that you already have in the first part of Clause 9 sufficient powers to enable any private generating stations for private use to be established, but in the second part you enable a series of works or companies to come in and take their waste heat from a central power station for generating electricity and then sell outside their surplus heat. This is a form of power station which is in common use on the North-east Coast, which this Bill is aimed to take over. I fail to understand why in Clause 7, having arranged to take over these various power stations, you should now in the second part of Clause 9 seek to re-establish or promote the establishment of new power stations on the very lines you are taking over. I submit the purpose is uniformity and co-ordination in a national system of electric power, and you are defeating that purpose by the second part of Clause 9. I hope the Committee will resist this proposal, because it strikes at a fundamental principle. The right hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>405</span>
said he wanted to encourage the greatest number of consumers to come on to the one common station. Surely the district authority you are setting up should provide the electricity from their own power stations and not from the private companies, and, unless the Home Secretary can show that I have entirely misunderstood this Clause, I hope he will be willing to agree to my proposal. One realises that it is very desirable that manufacturers should be able to produce their own electricity for their own consumption, and that even a number of workers should be able to do that by joint action. I submit, however, that that is provided for under the Sub-section of Clause 9, which we have already passed, and it is unnecessary to give these further powers which will simply mean establishing over again a large number of companies—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
