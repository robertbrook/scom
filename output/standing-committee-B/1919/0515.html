	<section>
	<div class='title'>THIRTEENTH DAY'S PROCEEDINGS.</div> <!-- title -->
	<div class='clause'>NEW CLAUSE.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(Advisory Committees.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>For the purpose of giving him advice and assistance in connection with the exercise and performance of his powers and duties, the Minister shall set up a panel of experts, appointed from nominees, chosen in such manner as he may prescribe, of the various classes of undertakings affected by this Act, and of labour, the trading interest, local authorities and such ether interests as he may deem desirable.</p>
	<p>Before exercising any of the powers under Section 3, Sub-section (1) (	<i>b</i>), or directing the establishment of new transport services by land or water, the Minister shall, provided he considers the question involved to be one of sufficient importance to justify such a reference, refer the matter to a Committee selected by him from the said panel.—[	<i>Mr. Shortt</i>.]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Minister would like to offer some short observation on the proposed Amendment standing in the name of the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Joynson-Hicks). I had explained to the right hon. Gentleman that I could not permit any explanation to be made until an Amendment had been actually moved, so that we might have something before the Committee. If the hon. Member will move his Amendment, and allow the Minister to make his statement, reserving his own speech until later, I think that will help forward business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. I beg to move, after the word "duties" ["his powers and duties"], to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"under this Act and for safeguarding any interests affected thereby."</p></blockquote>
I want to explain to hon. Members, however, as briefly as possible, the object of my various Amendments, so that they may have before them the nature and intention of my proposals before the Minister speaks. In this matter we have tried very hard to get some kind of Advisory Committee which would meet the views of the Minister and of my hon. Friends and myself. I had a talk yesterday afternoon with the Minister and have now put certain Amendments on the Paper; I think
	<span class='label label-info column'>958</span>
the best thing will be to read to the Committee the Clause as it would stand if my Amendments were accepted, and then leave it to the Minister to say what line he proposes to take. The Clause, as I want it to read, is as follows:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of giving advice and assistance to the Minister in connection with the exercise and performance of his powers and duties…"</p></blockquote>
And here I propose to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"under the Act and for safeguarding any interests affected thereby,".</p></blockquote>
—these are the same words as are already included in the old Rates Clause—and then, leaving out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Minister shall set up a panel of experts appointed from nominees chosen in such manner as he may prescribe"</p></blockquote>
I propose to insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"an Advisory Panel shall be appointed from the nominees of the various classes of undertakings affected by this Act, and of labour, the trading interest, local authorities—"</p></blockquote>
here I would insert "highway authorities" instead of "local authorities," and instead of "chosen in such manner as he may prescribe," we propose to leave the method of selection of these new panels to the Minister. Then the Clause goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before exercising any of the powers under Section 3, Sub-section (1) (	<i>b</i>), or directing the establishment of new transport services by land or water the Minister shall, provided he considers the question involved to be one of sufficient importance to justify such a reference, refer the matter to a committee selected by him from the said panel."</p></blockquote>
I submit it is quite impossible, where these great interests are concerned, that we should leave to the Minister the decision whether a matter shall be referred to the Committee or not. In our opinion it should be left entirely to the Committee itself, and therefore we propose that the Clause shall read after the word "reference,"
	<br><blockquote><p>"except in such matters which a Committee chosen from the panel shall consider to be not of sufficient interest, refer the matter to the advisory panel or to a committee thereof appointed by the panel."</p></blockquote>
There, I suggest, lies the whole difference between the Minister and myself. The Minister proposes that the panel of experts shall be appointed, and when there is any matter which those affected think should be referred to it, he will say whether or no it shall be so referred, and he will take out of the list of the panel half-a-dozen men who, he thinks, should decide the point. That, I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>959</span>
submit, is quite impossible for reasons which I will give later on, if the right hon. Gentleman does not accept my proposal. I say the matter should go to the panel in the ordinary way, and that the panel should pick out those whom it thinks are the right people to decide the particular question. And then I propose these words
	<br><blockquote><p>"The advisory panel or any committee to whom any matter is referred under this Section shall before reporting or advising if they see fit, give public notice and permit any person affected or likely to be affected to place their views before them either orally or in writing."</p></blockquote>
It will be seen that we have whittled down considerably the powers I wanted to give to the panel in my former Amendments. We have in fact gone a long way to meet the Minister. We have done away with legal machinery; we have made it much simpler. I propose now to leave it to the Minister to say how far he proposes to meet me, and then, if necessary, I will supply further arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The MINISTER (Designate) of WAYS and COMMUNICATIONS (Sir Eric Geddes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much regret that the Home Secretary, under the doctor's orders, is confined to the house and cannot be with us to-day. The spirit of the various Amendments which have been described by my hon. Friend is really summed up in two expressions which he used. The first expression finds its place in the first Amendment standing in his name, that it is with "the object of safeguarding the interests concerned." He says quite rightly that the word "safeguarding" appears in the Rates Clause, but the interests to be safeguarded there were the interests of the trading community and not of the transportation undertakings, whereas the safeguarding of the interests under this Clause is for the transportation undertakings. That is the spirit which stands as a veil between my hon. and learned Friend and myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not "learned."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought you were.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No—quite simple.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The expression which my hon. Friend used was that the panel itself should select a Committee which
	<span class='label label-info column'>960</span>
"should decide." These Committees have never been, so far as we have debated them here, intended to be deciding bodies. The intention has been to make them advisory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did I say "decide"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to put my point shortly. I should not perhaps have used the word "decide." These Committees are not asked and not empowered to do more than report and advise, and the final decision rests with the Board. If I have made a mistake in the use of the word, I apologise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite understand that it was not intentional, but still the phrase showed what was really at the back of the hon. Member's mind. He wants to be safeguarded, and I take it his intention is that not only shall the Committees advise, but that they shall have a restraining influence as well. I do not really see the exact purpose of the Amendment to the first half of the Clause. It may be there is some point I am missing, and if it comes out in debate I shall be very glad to discuss it further. But I thought, having regard to the conversations which I have had since we adjourned yesterday, and the spirit of some of the Amendments which are down, that if the Committee would allow me to say how far the Government would be prepared to go, it might shorten discussion. My suggestion is this: I will ask hon. Members to take the Clause and I will read in the Amendments which we accept—they are quite short; but they will make the point clear. I am not dealing in detail with the first part of the Clause, but in regard to the second what I suggest is that in order to meet the views of a great many members of the Committee, the Clause should read
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before exercising any of the powers under Section 3, Sub-section (1) (	<i>b</i>) to which the owners of the untertakings concerned object."</p></blockquote>
I take it if the owners of the undertakings wish those undertakings to be taken possession of there will be no need to consult the Advisory Committee first. Then after those words we propose that the Clause shall continue as printed and will read
	<br><blockquote><p>"of directing the establishment of new transport services by land or water."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>961</span>
Then I propose to cut out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided he considers the question involved to be one of sufficient importance to justify such a reference,"</p></blockquote>
and the second half of the Clause will read thus:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before exercising any of the powers under Section 3, Sub-section (1) (	<i>b</i>), to which the owners of the undertakings concerned object, or directing the establishment of new transport services by land or water, the Minister shall refer the matter to a committee selected by him from the said panel."</p></blockquote>
That is the suggestion which I venture to put before the Committee and I hope it will help to shorten discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has gone some way, I agree, to meet us in removing the objectionable point giving him the sole right to say whether a question shall be referred to this panel—I do not think it really matters whether we call it a panel or an advisory committee. But I must ask the right hon. Gentleman to go one step further: There are two points which affected many members of this Committee. The first was that the right hon. Gentleman was to be the sole authority to decide whether a matter should be referred to the committee. He has given way on that. The second is: he is to choose from this panel the particular people who shall decide the question—or rather who shall give advice on the point. This particular panel, I take it, will probably be a somewhat large body; I cannot say for certain and the right hon. Gentleman will forgive me, perhaps, when I say that we have not been able to get from him any indication of his proposals for the appointment of this advisory panel. He has given us an indication that it will be representative of the various classes of undertakings affected by this Bill—that is to say, of railway, dock, harbour, tramway, canal and motor industries, and there is presumably to be labour representation. If so there must be a sufficient number of labour representatives. Further than that trading interests are to be represented and that, I think, is more important than all the others. The local authorities are to be represented. Here, I think, the proper expression should be the highway authorities, because a local authority like a board of guardians can have no possible interest in this Bill I think, however, that the trading interests are really more important than any of the others. I have nothing to do with harbours, docks, or railways; I am here
	<span class='label label-info column'>962</span>
as a public man representing the great trading interests which must of necessity be largely represented on this panel. Suppose my right hon. Friend arranges with a dock authority that he is going to take over a portion of its dock with a view to transferring the wool trade from London to Hull; that might be quite conceivable, and it might also be conceivable, by the arrangement he makes with the dock authority, they might be induced to consent to it. It is the trading community, the wool importers and the wool merchants, who want to be heard in this matter. We should not allow the Minister and the dock authorities to make such arrangements without consulting the trading community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Labour may have something to say on that, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Labour may have something to say, because the removal of trade from London to Hull or from Bristol to Southampton or Liverpool would affect labour. Therefore, there must be a considerable panel appointed. We leave the arrangement for the appointments in the Minister's hands, but having a large advisory panel representing all these people the point comes, when a question has to be referred to them, who shall appoint the committee to advise the Minister. It is not right that the Minister with a panel of, say, 30 members representing all these interests should be the sole party to pick out from them a committee of five to whom a particular question should be referred. Suppose it is a question of taking over part of the London docks, he might say, "I will pick out from the panel"—and he might rightly say—"five members connected with docks to decide whether the proposal made was desirable or not." But that is not the point. The point is whether in the interests of trade and labour as well as in the interests of the docks the proposal made is desirable. Therefore, the point should be referred to the whole panel. They would be men of experience, men of position, men of honesty, appointed by their different organisations and men in whom the country has confidence, and it should be left to them to say who shall be the five men to form the committee to advise and report to the Minister upon any matters he refers to them. That is the main objection I have to the Minister's suggested Amendment to my proposal and I think he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>963</span>
might give way on that. We have met him very fairly in this matter. We have cut out all the restrictions which made my original Amendment too rigid, and I think he should accept my suggestion now. I suppose he will accept the Amendment, which I will technically move now for safeguarding any interests affected. I therefore beg to move, as an Amendment to the right hon. Gentleman's Amendment, after the word duties ["powers and duties"], to insert the words "under this Act and for safeguarding any interests affected thereby." That is to say, that this committee is not merely for the purpose of giving advice and assistance to the Minister—that is one of its powers—but also for the purpose of safeguarding the great interests affected by any such change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the reference which my hon. Friend has made to the other Clause in which the word "safeguard" has been used was not quite accurate and applicable. It appears to me that it is really unnecessary to put these words in. The interests of the concern are to be safeguarded by the Ministry. That is what the Ministry is set up to do and to put into an Act of Parliament that a committee is to be set up to prevent the Ministry doing harm to those for whose good it is specially set up is a contradiction of terms. We start in the Preamble by saying that this Ministry is for the purpose of improving the means of transportation. Therefore, I think the words are unnecessary and carry an unfortunate inference with them. If they really are of material benefit, and it can be shown that they are of material benefit, the Committee will put them in, but the Amendment carries an entirely unnecessary implication that the Ministry is going to do harm to these interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Minister has gone very far towards meeting the objections which I have always contended for, and I think that very little is now required to give that security for which we all of us have been asking. The words which my hon. Friend desires to see inserted are unnecessary now, but I think there is something in the point he has made. I think the Minister might consider that the mere fact of the owners of the undertaking not objecting will not conclude the objection to the matter. We have a striking instance in the way the railway vote goes in
	<span class='label label-info column'>964</span>
this Committee. You have settled with the railway companies, and, therefore, every time the test comes here the railway interests are with the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain R. GUINNESS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only one amongst so many.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. NIELD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But when the other comes at this end it is the same. I ask the representatives of labour to think about this. You may make your arrangement with the persons who actually own an undertaking, but you may prejudicially affect a very large number of persons who are depending upon the present condition of things. Trade may be moved. Very small matters, almost like the proverbial feather, tell the way the wind goes. You may move trade from one port to another and while the owners of the undertaking may be compensated, not necessarily in hard cash, but by being taken to another port on the same system with which they are connected, you may displace a tremendous amount of labour attached to that trade. Therefore, I think, it is necessary that not merely the owners of an undertaking, but that other persons who have a vital interest in the maintenance of the existing state of things should be consulted and have an opportunity of making representations to the members of the panel. I think the Minister's suggestion is a distinct advance over anything we have had before, and I shall be prepared to accept it. I cannot vote for the Amendment of my hon. Friend as at present said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A word as to the panel. Will the right hon. Gentleman appoint the panel in some such way as I suggested yesterday by making up his mind at the start as to the various interests to be represented. They are enormous, too numerous for me to mention now, but he and his advisors will know the interests that will be affected by anything under this Bill. He should proceed to select the very best men from those interests and make his register from them and make the registers entirely distinct. We do not want a panel wholly consisting of one class of men, because the questions are bound to be mixed. I cannot conceive any question which will leave out labour. In any question of transport you are bound to have labour concerned. Therefore you would have to draw from the labour panel. You must get a basis on your register of well-known men from the different interests, and then make a hapazard selection amongst those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>965</span>
men, so that it cannot be said that it is a packed committee. If such a process is resorted to by the Minister—and I lay the greatest possible stress upon the selection of men from every conceivable trade that is likely to be affected—before any dispute arises, it will disabuse the public minds of any suggestion of packing the panel, and he will have a perfect instrument for dealing with any question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I have been sufficiently patient since this Bill started as to justify me in making an appeal this morning that we should make real progress, that the speeches should be curtailed to the lowest possible minimum time, and that the fewest possible number of speeches should be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be my stupidity but I do not know where we are. Are we discussing the Amendment of the hon. Member for Twickenham, or the Amendments as summed up in the Minister's speech just now. If so I desire to say something about an Amendment, which I have on the Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member's Amendment will be in order, and he might reserve his speech for his own Amendment. I do not wish to prevent any Member saying anything he thinks necessary as arising out of what the Minister has said, but when the Minister's Amendment is before the Committee, then will be the time to discuss the Minister's Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respectfully agree with you, and I will be brief. The Amendment the hon. Member for Twickenham seems to be rather in the nature of tautology. I cannot help thinking that the duties of the Minister referred to in the original Clause must be the duties under this Act. They cannot possibly be misinterpreted as duties anywhere else. In the later part of his Amendment the hon. Member uses the words for the purpose of "safeguarding interests." Surely that again is wholly explanatory, and does not add in the least degree to the mandatory or enabling character of the Bill, even if the words were inserted. But there is a substantial intention in the mind of my right hon. Friend in having made this suggestion. Later on in the Clause the word "interest" occurs—"trade interest." That is, perhaps, a limited reference, and I have handed in an Amend-
	<span class='label label-info column'>966</span>
ment, which I will move, to leave out the word "interest" in order to insert the word "interests." If that alteration is accepted it will meet the substantial point of my hon. Friend, and I hope he may see his way to withdraw his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>The following Amendment stood in the name of 	<b>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</b>:</p>
	<p>Leave out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister shall set up a panel of experts appointed from nominees chosen in such manner as he may prescribe,"</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>and insert instead thereof the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"An advisory panel shall be."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member move his next Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After what the Minister has said, I will not move it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move to leave out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"chosen in such manner as he may prescribe,"</p></blockquote>
and to insert instead thereof the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"after consultation with the various undertakings concerned."</p></blockquote>
I think after the words "after consultation with the various undertakings" the words "and interests" might be added as a better way of expressing the intention of the Minister. That would be better than the words "chosen in such a manner as he may prescribe." He still would have the power of appointment after consultation with the various undertakings and interests concerned. This is an alteration which he might reasonably accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question, "That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Clause," put, and agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. I thought that the Minister had accepted the proposal of my hon. Friend (Mr. France) and we simply said "Aye," thinking it was carried, but apparently it was not. Evidently, in the mode the Question was put, what we have done is to negative the hon. Member's proposal. This was by pure inadvertence. I would appeal to you to put. the Question over again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is any mistake I am simply here to endeavour to put it in proper form, and I shall stand on no ceremony if this would meet the wishes of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. CHAMBERLAIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Batley (Mr. France) said that the words "and interests" ought to be inserted after "undertakings." I wish to be quite clear whether these words are to be in the Clause or not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that I should alter the wording to "various undertakings and interests," as I had no wish not to consult the other interests concerned which might be the interests of labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand, you must first rule out the words which the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move to leave out the word "local" and to insert instead thereof the word "highway." It is quite clear that "local" is a mistake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that it was a matter on which the highway authorities would be consulted in connection with transport questions. If there are other local authorities my right hon. Friend will say so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only point on this is that I am advised that "local authorities" includes all highway authorities, and that "highway authorities" does not include all local authorities. There are local authorities who might justifiably expect to be consulted on matters affecting their area just as the trading community
	<span class='label label-info column'>968</span>
might. It is quite true that local authorities who are owners of docks would be consulted, but there are local authorities who are very large subscribers to docks, and are still not any part of the undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, after "Sub-section (1) (	<i>b</i>)," to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the exercise of which the owners of the undertaking concerned object."</p></blockquote>
As the Home Secretary is not here I would like to reserve the right before the Report stage to reconsider this, because it is a very important alteration, and I have not been able to consult the Home Secretary about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should I be in order in referring to my Amendment as an alternative to the words of the Minister-designate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, you will be in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister-designate has made a proposal to meet the views of the Committee, but he is anxious to reserve his judgment, and it is therefore with more confidence that I venture to suggest that the decision on these matters of the reference Committee should not be left entirely in the hands of the Ministry, but should be decided by a committee chosen from the panel, and that they should decide whether a matter is sufficient important to be referred to the Committee or not. To refer only such matters as those to which owners of undertakings object is only to deal with half the subject. There may be very good reasons why a matter should be referred to a committee of experts which includes not only the undertakings, but is also representative of labour and local authorities. The reason why I think that there should be a reference to a small committee of the panel is this: It is quite obvious that the Minister cannot always know all the reasons why a matter is of importance, and should be referred to a Committee for information. Through lack of knowledge he may not know matters of supreme importance to the local authorities or to labour. Therefore I suggest that there should be added something which would produce the effect intended by my Amendment, so that not only may the undertakings object, but any three members of the panel, possibly a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>969</span>
Labour member with a representative of the local authority, acting together might call on the Minister to refer the matter to a Committee for investigation and advice. The Minister might as well accept this as a safeguard and help to himself. The responsibility of deciding what is and what is not an important matter without full knowledge is a very serious one, and I should have thought the right hon. Gentleman would welcome advice not only from the undertakings but from all those that are concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir A. SHIRLEY BENN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister-designate has shown such a desire to meet many of the members that I do not wish to move any Amendment to his Amendment, but I should like to ask him if he would be willing to meet one of the objections which I personally hold very strongly. In reforming transport he is bound to change the trend of certain trades, and I should be glad if he would be willing to add some such words as "or are likely to divert the trend of trade from its ordinary channel."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WIGNALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I desire to say a word on behalf of the Labour party. This proposal seems to me to narrow itself too much. You are confining it simply to owners. In the developments that must necessarily follow this big and important change there may be a diversion of trade and traffic, and every interest may be consulted except the one interest that is of most importance to us—that is, the earning power of the men concerned. Their livelihood may be taken away by the diversion of traffic, and labour as well as the employer ought to have the right to object and be heard before such changes take place. Therefore if the Minister-designate could see his way to provide that the workers also should have the right to be consulted in these matters, then we could heartily welcome the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has told us quite frankly that he may have to reconsider this Amendment on the Report. I would suggest that he should omit it now with the full understanding that it is quite open to him to bring up a considered Amendment on the Report as soon as he has been able to consult the Home Secretary. This would save the Committee a great deal of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ROWLANDS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Batley
	<span class='label label-info column'>970</span>
(Mr. France), that it will be best on behalf of labour that we should have something a little more than is conceded. We do not desire anything that will hamper the hands of the Minister, or give him too large a body to consult, but we think the scope he has suggested should be slightly broadened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>Further Amendment made: In the second paragraph, leave out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided he considers the question involved to be one of sufficient importance to justify such a reference."—[	<i>Sir E. Geddes</i>.]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move in the second paragraph, after the word "shall," to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"except in such matters which a Committee chosen from the panel shall consider to be not of sufficient importance."</p></blockquote>
I have given reasons why I think there should be some assistance given to the Minister, and it is all the more necessary now, as he only has the advice of the undertakings concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CHAMBERLAIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These words are very bad English.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander DAWES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will not the Minister accept some such words as were indicated in the speech of the hon. Member for Batley, namely, that two or three members of the panel should be entitled to require a reference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My objection is simply one of time. It was in order to save time that I undertook to refer all these matters without any discretion. I would have liked discretion. The Committee will realise that I do not particularly like the Clause as we have been discussing it. I wanted the discretion, because 1 thought we would find a certain number of minor matters which it was really quite unnecessary to refer for advice, but in deference to the wishes of the Committee, I undertook to refer all these matters. 1 did that to avoid specifically the very procedure which is now being urged upon us, and I did it reluctantly because I thought it was a worse evil. Under the proposal now put forward, there would be a panel which is suggested as thirty, but which I imagine will be considerably larger, and before you could decide whether a matter should be referred to a committee you would have to circularise the whole of the panel to ask them whether they wanted it to be referred to them, or else you would have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>971</span>
to have a standing committee of the panel to whom you would have to refer, first of all, as to whether you should then refer it to a special committee of the panel, which you would then have to choose. It was only to save time that I accepted a reference of everything, except where the owners agreed to being taken possession of. I appreciate the point that has been made by my hon. Friend, the Member for the Drake Division of Plymouth (Sir A. Shirley Benn), and from the Labour benches, that there are other interests than purely the interests of the owners, and as the whole Clause will be reconsidered on the Report stage, if the Committee will accept my assurance that we will consider it between now and then I will look at that particular point, but I am very anxious not to have a reference to a committee to decide whether another reference shall be made to another committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman consider some such words as
	<br><blockquote><p>"to which the owners of the undertaking or other interests concerned object"?</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in the second paragraph, after the word "shall," to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"the advisory panel or a committee thereof appointed by the panel."</p></blockquote>
There were two points upon which I differed from the right hon. Gentleman. One was the right of the Minister to select the questions to be sent to the panel, and the other was the right of the Minister to select the Committee from the panel. The first point we have cleared up. I thought the panel would be a very big one, representing numerous interests, and possibly thirty in number. The Minister has told us it may be sixty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say sixty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought you did. At all events, it would be a large number. The last point of difference I have with the Minister is that I do not think, when there is a matter to be referred to an advisory panel, that he ought to be the man to pick out of these thirty or more members of the panel the particular five or six who are to be the advisers or judges on any particular question. He will have his panel there, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>972</span>
he will be bound to have some organisation of the panel. There will be bound to be a chairman and probably a standing committee of that panel, and I think the proper course is to refer the matter to the panel and ask the panel to select the appropriate committee, who will advise the Minister upon the question. We have tried our level best to meet the Minister, and to give him a Clause which will be workable in the interests not merely of the Minister himself, but of the whole community which may be affected by the Clause. An enormous number of interests will be affected, not the least of which is labour. I want the Committee to realise that you cannot expect, if the Minister selects a panel of five railway men, or five dock men, or five local authority men, that those men will be sufficiently independent to advise upon a question without being warped by their previous views as railway men, or dock men, or local authority men. If, for instance, it is desired to take over the Port of London, I think it should be referred to a committee selected from the panel by the panel itself. I would not, for instance, put the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Sir W. Raeburn) and his colleagues on that committee. I would put on one dock man, one railway man, interested in the running of railways into the Port of London, one or two railway men who know the labour interests in the East end of London, and one or two representatives of the great trading community of London. I do not say it offensively to the right hon. Gentleman, but the matter is of vital importance that, having once established your big panel, you must have full confidence in them, and leave them to select the particular sub-panel to decide the particular question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had some experience on another Advisory Committee, namely the Merchant Shipping Advisory Committee of the Board of Trade. We had a vast number of interests committed for our advice, and the Committee decided always who the sub-committees should be to sit upon any particular subject. It worked admirably. We knew who on that committee had experience on the particular points we had to discuss, and I think our choice was always justified by the decisions that we came to. I cannot quite agree with my hon. Friend, who says that if you are going to consider a dock matter, you should not put a. dock
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>973</span>
member on the committee. Certainly you should not put only dock members on, but if you have any confidence at all in your panel, you could surely leave it to them to decide how many of them and which of them are to consider a particular subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CHAMBERLAIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Committee will not support this Amendment. Its adoption would entail a considerable amount of delay. If every question is to be referred to the committee, and if it is to go round the whole panel, which might easily consist of sixty people, although the Minister did not commit himself to any particular number, the committee would have to be brought together for the purpose of selecting a sub-committee in order to give the Minister advice on the particular point referred to. This is not to be a committee sitting in London continuously; it is only a body of people to be brought together occasionally for certain particular purposes. It has no analogy with the Shipping Committee, which deals with only one particular item.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CHAMBERLAIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, with one particular industry. It is going to be connected with a great number of different interests, and therefore there is no analogy between the two committees. If we are going to set up a ministry of this kind, we should trust the Minister, whoever he may be, not to pack the jury to which he has to refer a particular question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to point out that the Amendment of my hon. Friend would lead to complications in the working of this system. If the Minister, whoever he may be, is not to be trusted to select a sub-committee from the whole panel, then he is not to be trusted with his job at all, and I cannot help thinking that the whole system suggested by this Amendment would set up complications and hindrances which would prevent the smooth and quick working of the Bill when the Ministry has been established. Therefore I shall vote against the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to be told by the Minister-designate whether he has in his mind any idea of placing permanent officials upon this Advisory Committee, because, if he has, then my attitude will be changed entirely in the vote I propose to give on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>974</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain HAMILTON BENN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to impress upon the Committee the advisability of accepting this Amendment. We are particularly anxious that in this matter there should be an independent committee, and the public, I am sure, will never accept this as an independent committee if it is chosen in the way suggested in the Minister's Clause. The whole idea of the formation of the Committee is to obtain independent and unbiased advice upon any proposal that is made, and it will certainly not meet the views of the large trading community if that committee is selected in the manner proposed in this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Committee will allow me to put the question very soon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to my hon. Friend's question regarding permanent officials being placed upon the committee, I am told I cannot do it. I think it would be a very wrong thing to do, for permanent officials do not represent any of the interests, and it would be very unfair to propose to put them on this body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are never put on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as the Amendment is concerned, I entirely agree with what was said by my hon. Friend opposite (Mr. Chamberlain) as to the delay it would cause. Not only would it cause delay, but it breathes a spirit of distrust in the Ministry which I have been sorry to see prevalent throughout the discussion—not distrust personally in the Minister, but distrust in the Ministry. It seems to be altogether overlooked that this panel is proposed by the Government with the object of securing the best possible advice on which they can exercise the authority given them under the Bill. It is to enable them to decide wisely that we are agreeing to the panel, and we do not desire to have set up a body which can hamper and prevent them acting, and which, in fact, is to act as a watchdog over the Committee. Under these circumstances 1 propose to resist the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHN JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, at the end, to add the words,

I am moving this Amendment on behalf of those who sit on these [	<i>Labour</i>] benches in order that we may establish, if possible, a principle which is to-day creating a great amount of interest in the ranks of organised! labour. In the organisations that are likely to be affected by the new Ministry so far as labour is concerned it is the almost unanimous feeling that labour should be more adequately represented on any committee that may have to deal with their industries in the future. In so far as the Whitley Report is concerned the principle has been laid down that in all the Industrial Councils, Reconstruction Committees, Work Committees, and other committees that may be formed under a Whitley Scheme, 50 per cent. of the representation should be allocated to labour. We have no desire by placing representatives upon this Committee to in any way hamper the power or to restrict the activities of the Minister-designate, but so far as labour is concerned, if this Ministry cannot start with the good will of Labour behind it, it is not likely to be very successful. When you remember that the Ministry will have to deal with such great undertakings as the railways, docks and canals, and that the workmen in these industries are organised almost to a man, the importance of this Amendment which we are pressing the Ministry to accept will at once be recognised. At present there are 33 Councils in existence dealing with the main industries of the country, and the principle embodied in this Amendment has already been accepted in the case of those Councils.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that is a rather indefinite way of expressing labour interests. We want that the labour interest shall be definitely understood as representing what is commonly recognised, in trading matters, as the labour interest catering for the classes that are employed in the undertakings of industries. Therefore, as at the Railwaymen's Congresses, at the Miners' Congresses, and at the Transport Workers' Congresses, this principle is laid down as one that requires to be accepted by private employers. We think that this new Department of State should also insert it in the provisions of this legislation. We have an earnest desire to help to carry to success any scheme that may in the future be devised by the Ministry, and we therefore ask the Committee to give favourable considerations to this Amendment, and to at least see that any Advisory Committee that may be established shall include a 50 per cent. representation of labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>977</span>
with the view of making references to this advisory panel more effective and more likely to meet what I think are the wishes of the various interests concerned. This is a much milder Clause than the one embodied in my original Amendments. We have cut off all the legal portion of the business; we provide here that when the advisory panel or committee gets some question referred to it by the Minister it may, if it sees fit—and the discretion is in the committee itself—give notice to and allow anybody—and this word "anybody" includes undertakings or authorities—to come before them and state their views. I cannot conceive it possible that the Minister will object to this Clause if this advisory panel is to be a 	<i>bonâ fide</i> one. We ask that the Minister should give to these whom he selects from his own panel the power to say "let the interests put their views before us either orally or in writing, not in regard to any small trumpery affair, for such a matter would not be referred to it, but on any important question which affects any interest from the point of view either of capital or of labour, of individuals or of local authorities." It seems to me absurd to expect that we should put the whole of their future fate in the hands of a panel of five or six gentlemen without giving that panel the power of calling before them those whose interests are affected. I hope my right hon. Friend will accept this Amendment which does not cut at the root of the Clause or do away with any of its benefits, but will give additional powers to the panel. I am confident that the Committee itself, looking at it in that light, will be able to accept it.</p>

Under this new Clause the Minister is asking for more power than has been given to him by the Bill. He is asking for powers to establish new transport services by land or water. The Bill in Clauses 2, 3, and 4 gives him no power to form new transport services other than by inland waterways. I am quite aware that the right hon. Gentleman pointed out yesterday that at the end of the Bill there is a Clause giving power for the Minister to continue such services, as the railways are carrying on or have power to carry on. But he is given no power by the Bill so far to form a transport service other than by inland water. If I am not correct, why is the Minister, on page 863 of the Amendment paper, asking for these powers in a new Clause which has not yet been moved? If we pass the Clause we are now discussing, the Minister will say later on, when we come to his new Clause, "I have the power already." If he will give an undertaking that when he

	<span class='label label-info column'>979</span>
brings forward his new Clause in regard to the power to form transport services by land or water he will not say that, then I will allow the present Clause to pass. Otherwise I must protest against the inserting of words here giving greater powers than those already given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I can disabuse my hon. Friend's mind of a misunderstanding. The mere fact of this Clause forbidding a Minister from doing a certain thing does not enable them to do it or prejudice the enabling Clause at the later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the hon. Member means when he says that I am pointing out what is in the Bill, and I think he ought not to correct me in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not correcting the hon. Member. I am trying to explain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want your explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that this Clause prevents the Minister from doing a certain thing does not enable him to do it in any shape or form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Give that explanation to the Minister. Do not give it to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Through my own inadvertence and your great promptitude, Mr. Brace, in putting the Motion as to labour representation on these committees I did not reply, but I am sure my Labour Friends will acquit me of any idea of discourtesy. I voted against the Amendment, although no one regards more than I do the extreme importance of giving labour a full share and say in the fate of these undertakings where labour is so much concerned. Probably in no undertaking is the proportion of labour expense greater than in transport; but I feel that it would be a very hampering thing to be obliged to put 50 per cent. of labour on all these committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FRANCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does "labour" mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Workers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SWAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Organised labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If 50 per cent. of labour was put on the other interests concerned, such as docks, railways and roads, all of which might be very vitally interested, and the variety of trading
	<span class='label label-info column'>980</span>
interests would also have to be represented, it would make the committee too unwieldy. That is the reason why I voted against the Amendment, and not from any idea of minimising the great importance of labour to what is done under this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WATERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister give us any idea of the amount of representation that he intends to labour on these committees? If he could give us some idea it would somewhat appease the difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It must be quite clear that the number would vary from time to time. They would vary very much according to the class of question referred to the committee. There are certain questions where Labour would certainly predominate over such an interest as the trading interest. Such a question, for instance, as a technical matter about the type of appliance which might be wanted. There are other questions upon which the Labour interests would not be so strong. I do not think it would be possible, even after much greater consideration than 1 can give now to lay down any scale upon which Labour or any other interest could be represented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain HAMILTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not say that the Clause has been rushed through, but it has been very much changed in its form, and we have not had a very good opportunity of considering it in all its bearings. We must not be considered to be committed to it when it comes down to the House. The Minister himself has said that he may have to alter it in some respects, and we must do the same. The point that I feel strongly about is the selection of the committee which will be chosen from the panel and the method by which it will be chosen from the panel. That I think requires further consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will not allow his mind to be driven to the conclusion that any Clause of this Bill has been "rushed." I am an old Member of Parliament, and 1 am bound to say that I have never known a Bill to be given greater time than this Bill. As Chairman I should be disappointed if Members went from the Committee stage to the House of Commons under the impression that they had been rushed on any one Clause. I hope that that opinion does not prevail very largely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We all appreciate the great courtesy that you have shown in your conduct and the very great fairness you have shown to all of us who have felt it to be our duty to oppose certain parts of the Bill. I associate myself with what my hon. Friend has said. In regard to this particular Clause we have not had the advice of the Home Secretary. The Minister-designate told us quite candidly that he was not quite certain in regard to one of his own Amendments what exactly it meant, and I frankly say that we are not quite convinced that the Clause is in exactly the form that it ought to be on Report stage. I do not think my hon. Friend meant to imply more than that. In passing this Clause we reserve our rights on Report stage to re-debate if necessary one or two of the points raised in the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely my point is of sufficient importance to merit some sort of reply. It should not be left to the hon. Member for Maldon (Sir F. Flannery) to reply. I maintain that the words are out of place in this Clause as regards the power to establish new transport services. The right hon. Gentleman is asking for those powers in a later new Clause. If I am not in order, why does he ask in the new Clause for these powers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>The following new Clause stood on the Paper in the name of Sir E. GEDDES:—</p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>NEW CLAUSE.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(Powers as to Railway Wagons.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>(1) His Majesty in Council may at any time after the passing of this Act by order authorise the Minister to purchase or take on hire privately-owned railway wagons required for use on any railway, and to work or lease any such wagons when so purchased or taken on hire, or to apportion them among the several railway undertakings in such manner, on such terms, and subject to such conditions as may be provided by or under this order.</p>
	<p>Provided that before any such Order in Council is made, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of Parliament for a period of not less than thirty days during which that House is sitting, and if either of those Houses before the expiration of those thirty days presents an address to His Majesty against the draft, or any part thereof, no further proceedings shall be taken thereon without prejudice to the making of any new draft Order.</p>
	<p>(2) The consideration for any wagons so purchased or taken on hire shall, in default of agreement, be determined by the Railway and Canal Commission.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>982</span>
	<p>(3) Any capital sum payable under an agreement or award may be discharged in whole or in part, if the Treasury so direct, by the issue of securities, and the amount of such securities equivalent to such capital sum shall, in default of agreement, be determined by the Railway and Canal Commission.</p>
	<p>For that purpose the Treasury may create and issue securities, the interest on which shall be charged on the revenues derived from the wagons so acquired, after the payment thereout of working expenses, and if and so far as such revenues are insufficient on the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, or the growing produce thereof, and which shall bear interest at such rate and shall be subject to such conditions and regulations as to repayment, redemption, or otherwise as the Treasury may direct or prescribe, and the regulations may apply with the necessary modifications any or the enactments relating to local loans stock.</p>
	<p>(4) Notwithstanding any statutory or other provision to the contrary it shall be lawful for the Minister to make regulations prohibiting the use on railways of privately-owned wagons or limiting or restricting the number of wagons to be so used and prescribing the type and capacity thereof.</p>
	<p>Provided that nothing herein contained shall authorise the prohibition of the use on railways of such wagons as comply with regulations made in pursuance of the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, or any other enactment in force at the date of the passing of this Act and as are in use, under repair, or in course of construction at that date.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to move the Clause as it stands on the Paper. There have been a great many representations made on this subject, and we have had numerous conferences. Therefore, rather than deal at great length with the Amendments on the Clause, I think it would shorten the time of the Committee if a new Clause which is more or less agreed upon were put down. It will be put down to-night, and then there will be until next Tuesday to consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NELSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The interests concerned are very great, and consultations amongst those who are interested should take place before the new Clause is discussed next week. It will be impossible over the week-end to consult the interest in different parts of the country, and I shall appreciate it very much if the Minister-designate could see his way to place in my hands to-day a copy of the new Clause so that I may consider it along with some of those who are in London now and in a

	<br><blockquote><p>Provided that—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(1) if the establishment of any such service will involve an original capital expenditure exceeding one million pounds, or the acquisition of land compulsorily, or the breaking up of any roads, the Minister shall not exercise his powers unless authorised to do so by Order in Council a draft whereof has been approved by a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament, and the Order may incorporate the provisions of the Lands Clauses Acts, subject to such modifications as may be specified in the Order, being modifications of those Acts made or authorised to be made by the Development and Road Improvements Funds Act, 1909, or any other enactment, and the Order may also incorporate or apply any enactments relating to the construction and maintenance of the works in question; and (ii) where it appears to the Minister that the establishment of any such service could properly be undertaken by the owners of any existing undertaking, the Minister shall not himself establish the service without first giving to such owners an opportunity of establishing the service, and where such an opportunity is given to the owner of an undertaking of which possession has been retained or taken under Section 3 of this Act and those owners prefer that the establishment of the service should be undertaken by themselves rather than by the Minister, they may require the Minister to give them directions under that Section to that effect, but shall not be deemed to have thereby concurred in those directions.</p></blockquote>

It will be remembered that Clause 4 was taken out of the Bill on Second Reading and an assurance was given that this matter should be brought up in Committee by separate Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is first a provision enabling the Minister to establish and work transport services by land or water. Then there is the limitation that he shall not establish a service which will involve an original expense exceeding £1,000,000 unless authorised to do by Order in Council, nor shall he establish a service which necessitates the acquisition of land compulsorily or the breaking up of roads, so that no very large undertaking can be undertaken by the Minister without an Order in Council authorising him to do so. Then the present undertakings are safeguarded in this way, that the Minister shall not establish a service without first giving the owners of the undertaking an opportunity of establishing the service. Then Sub-section (2) simply directs that the expenses of working the service established by the Minister shall be paid out of the revenues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will realise that this is a very important Clause, and that there are several important Amendments, particularly some standing in the name of the right hon. Baronet the Member for the City of London (Sir F. Banbury) in regard to the limitation of expenses. This is a Clause which has been brought on in consequence of a decision of the House of Commons that the Minister-designate was not to have the power to rush headlong about the country establishing services by land or water, but was to be limited particularly with regard to expenses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are very personal—you say "the Minister-designate."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking of the Minister-designate not as a person but as a corporation. [Laughter.] I do not know why the Committee smiles. A Minister is a corporation with a perpetual succession. I do not refer to any particular Minister. We shall be confined later on to the individual Amendment, but in discussing the Clause I want it to be realised that this is a very serious Clause, and that when we come to the forms limiting the financial powers and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>985</span>
the powers of the Minister to establish transport services we are doing what the House of Commons has asked us specifically to do. That being so, I shall have to ask grave consideration by the Committee of the various Amendments that are down. This Clause itself has not been before the House of Commons. We are here, the first time, discussing this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to know what is the meaning of those words in relation to the establishment of transport services by land or water? Is the right hon. Gentleman going to set up lines of steamers whether oversea or cross Channel? We are quite aware that the Clause says he is to consult those who are interested, but we want to know if this money is going to be advanced to existing lines or to be given to new lines? That is a great power. The Minister might set himself up as one of the great shipowners of the country. I quite agree that this power is limited to undertakings involving something like a million pounds, but you could get a good many small coasting vessels for a million pounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that it is impossible that I could start a coastal service, and it is impossible for me to become one of the largest shipowners in the world. Apart from the money limitation which would prevent the Minister from becoming one of the largest shipowners in the world, though it would not prevent him starting a coastal service, it is provided in the Bill, as it has been so far passed, that a service by sea cannot be started except in such conditions as would make what the hon. Member refers to impossible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman will put words in the Clause to that effect I am perfectly agreeable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question, "That the Clause be read a second time," put, and agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, at the beginning, to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"For a period of two years after the passing of this Act."</p></blockquote>
I understood at the outset that this Bill was largely experimental. There was to be a period given for the Minister to develop the transport scheme. These are all very serious matters. If they are to be carried on in perpetuity, I understood all along that quite a number of the things detailed in this Cluase were to be only for
	<span class='label label-info column'>986</span>
the experimental period. A great deal more will have to be said in connection with this if it is to be in perpetuity. Therefore I hope that it is not intended by the Minister to do more than put these matters in the Clause for that period of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is rather surprising that my right hon. Friend should suggest that State money should be spent upon starting transportation services, and should cease at the end of two years. It would be wasting money in most instances unless you put on a road service where capital expenditure was comparatively small and moveable. It would be quite impossible for such an Amendment to be accepted without entirely sterilising this Clause. Apart from that, Clause 4, of which this Clause was left as a residue when we took out what I may call for shortness the nationalisation provisions, was specifically a permanent Clause. It is the view of the Government that the needs of the community, housing needs, agricultural needs, and many other State purposes make it necessary for the State to have power to start transportation services. The limitations as to expenditure and as to the compulsory land come on later, but in the opinion of the Government it is essential that this should be established as a permanent power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry to differ from the right hon. Gentleman. There was a distinct question asked in Parliament as to what would become of these services. I asked this question on the Second Reading, and the answer was that it would be left to Parliament to decide. On the 17th of March the Minister-designate was speaking on the provisions of Clause 4, paragraph (	<i>f</i>), and the following is the OFFICIAL REPORT of what took place:
	<br><blockquote><p>Sir E. GEDDES: It is also proposed to transfer the powers in Clause 4, Sub-section (1) (	<i>f</i>), which were permanent powers, and make them temporary powers under Clause 3, and to provide that, in addition, during the two years, the Minister shall have the right, subject to Treasury control, to construct such works as may be necessary. That is really essential if we are to have legal powers to carry out the scheme—it may be railway development, or something of that kind, which we could not reasonably expect that existing railway companies or other transport agencies would undertake.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Sir E. CARSON: Will that include shipping?</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Sir E. GEDDES: No; it does not.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS: What becomes of them at he end of two years?</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>987</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>Sir E. GEDDES: The wagons and the undertakings will become the property of the Government.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>MR. JOYNSON-HICKS: You will not have power before two years under paragraph (	<i>f</i>). What will happen at the end of two years?</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Sir E. GEDDES: They will belong to the Government, and the Government will have to seek powers at the end of two years to deal with the whole question of transportation."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, Monday, 17th March, 1919. Vol. 118, page 1777.]</p></blockquote>
My right hon. Friend just now said that these were permanent powers under Clause 4, but in his speech in the House he said,
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is also proposed to transfer the powers in Clause 4, Sub-section (1) (	<i>f</i>), which were permanent powers and make them temporary powers."</p></blockquote>
It is perfectly clear that there was a definite statement in the House of Commons that the powers of Sub-section (1) (	<i>f</i>) to establish transport services by land or water, which were strongly objected to in the House of Commons, are to be temporary powers for the two years. That being so, the whole of my right hon. Friend's speech that he has just made goes by the board, and I do not see how he can possibly resist the Amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Dumbarton. I was going myself to suggest an Amendment which I thought might have met his views, but I do not think I dare do so after the House of Commons has dealt with the matter. A distinct pledge was given by the Minister in charge in his opening speech, so Sir Edward Carson and myself both taking part in the discussion, and I do not think that we ought to extend the provision which the right hon. Gentleman assured the House of Commons would be of a temporary character. Before making a suggestion I would like to have the views of the right hon. Gentleman on that speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NEAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think there is a misapprehension here, and that it is quite easy to deal with it. The Clause as moved by the right hon. Gentleman says
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be lawful for the Minister to establish and work transport services."</p></blockquote>
The Amendment says that he may establish during two years and work during two years transport services, but that his power should then automatically cease. Surely that cannot be what is meant. I take it that an Amendment limiting the Minister's right to establish to two years"'
	<span class='label label-info column'>988</span>
and continuing his right to work after that should meet the point. If the Clause read: "It shall be lawful for the Minister to establish within a period of two years and work new transport services," would not that meet the point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NEAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then it comes exactly to what the Minister says, and I think it is a 	<i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, which I cannot think is what my hon. Friend means. What the right hon. Gentleman has pointed out is that if this Amendment is carried he may establish within two years services which at the end of two years will become derelict.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, he comes to Parliament in regard to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NEAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well to say that, but there is no power to deal with them unless and until Parliament gives further power. What possible chance would there be of the Minister establishing any service under those conditions? I agree that there ought to be some restraint in point of time upon the Minister in the establishment of services and that, to that extent, it should be a temporary power, but when once the undertaking is established, I see no reason why it should not be continued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were two matters which were taken out of the old Clause 4 in the House on Second Reading. One referred to the purchase and taking on hire of railway wagons, and the other to the establishment, maintenance, and working of transport services. 1 am not responsible for the note or what was said by anyone else on that occasion, but in the Bill as it was originally drawn—and it was drawn with some care—the purchase of wagons and the establishment of these transport services were permanent. All of Clause 4, which referred also to other matters, was withdrawn, and there was a feeling shown in the House that the Clause as it stood was not liked. These two matters were specifically referred to in the House on Second Reading, and although the rest of Clause 4 was withdrawn altogether, these two matters were, it was understood, to be brought up again—permanent matters. In the new Clause which is now before the Committee, and in another Clause which will be put on the Paper to-night, these two matters which were permanent matters in the original Bill are again put down in the same way
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>989</span>
as permanent matters. I do not say that the Committee has not absolute power to limit the Minister to two years if it so wishes, but I do think that the framers of the Amendment are under some misapprehension. These particular matters which were put in the Bill as permanent must be permanent matters, because you cannot purchase railway wagons for two years, and if you are going to establish a new transport service, either by land or water, it is not common sense to suppose that anyone could establish it for two years only.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SWAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this Amendment were carried it would simply stultify the whole value of the Bill. We are looking forward to its being carried into effect in order to carry out the great promises made to the House by the Minister-designate to open up new lines, to give facilities for better housing, to open up new industries, and to assist agriculture. Under the Amendment a scheme might be initiated by the Minister and have to be dropped just when the country was going to reap the benefit of the scheme. I have in my hand a very important letter, that does not come from organised labour at all, but from a district that looks forward to new railway extension scheme. It is from the clerk of a council seeking the extension of a railway from one part to another, and he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is a very important question in a dale like this, as I am very sure that this dale would compare very favourably with any other dale in the country, because it has quite a number of industries such as lead mining, brites, iron ore, limestone, whinstone, and ganister. In this dale minerals are found in abundant quantities,"</p></blockquote>
but because of the lack of transit facilities and the indifference of the various companies to the development of this area, they have laid dormant, and men are out of employment. The writer goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Agriculture also would prove to be no small item if only there were some mode of transport for getting produce away to the market, and also bringing foodstuffs and manure back up the dale. I may say that we are at present entirely devoid of any kind of transit. We have not even a carrier to take away dairy produce to the market. Seeing that so much of the low-lands have come under the plough, there ought to be some of the high-lying districts brought under cultivation, which can only be done by opening up the railways. The lessons of the last five years ought to teach us what to do."</p></blockquote>
If the Minister attempts to extend the scheme beyond a couple of years he would have to close up, under the terms of this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain GUINNESS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see the difficulty which the right hon. Gentleman is in. He establishes certain undertakings, and he cannot let go at a given moment, but surely he might have a period of 18 months, like the railway companies, in which he can bring before Parliament his scheme. In the two years he could establish his experiment, and he might go on working it for 18 months afterwards, during which latter period he would have time to come before the House of Commons. Some of us strongly object to the principle of the State running the railways. We do not want on a side issues to find ourselves committed to that principle. If the country wants to have State railways, let them have them, but let us have a straightforward and clean-cut issue. Do not let us prejudice ourselves by the Bill if we can avoid it. I think the Amendment, therefore, might be made in such a form as to give the Minister a further period of 18 months in which he might work the railways established in the two years, as was done in the case of the railway companies. What is sauce for the goose might, I think, be sauce for the gander also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CHAMBERLAIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to make a somewhat similar suggestion, but I would suggest that it is hardly necessary to limit the time to eighteen months, during which the Minister may carry on the working of these services after the expiration of the two years, for this reason, that Parliament can at any time stop his working the services, and as he will have to come before Parliament to establish his transportation policy, it will then be open for Parliament to put an end if they choose to the working of any services which have been established during the transition period by the Minister. I think the Minister is bound to accept an Amendment limiting his powers of establishment, acquisition, or construction under this Section to the two years' period, and I have ventured to draft another proviso to this effect, namely, "that the powers of establishment, acquisition, and construction under this Section shall not, unless Parliament otherwise determine, be exercised after a period of two years from the passing of this Act."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When this Bill was introduced I had the greatest fear, and I expressed it in the House on Second Reading, that, drafted as I believed it to be in the interests of the railway companies,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>991</span>
some such provision as this would remain in the Bill, which would enable the Minister to do for the coastwise service of this country what the railway companies have been trying to do during the last twenty years, and which they have almost succeeded in doing, but not quite, as regards the coastwise trade between England and Ireland. On a previous Amendment I tried to stop that matter. This is a provision which would enable the Minister, through the railway companies and through powers of theirs which might be extended, to put on services between England and Ireland, that would entirely do away—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended till 4 o'clock</i>.</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STEVENS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Adjournment I was pointing out by one illustration how private enterprise might be entirely stifled as regards coastwise trade by some action of the Ministry under the Clause we are now considering. I might multiply that a great deal, but I do not want to occupy the time of the Committee unnecessarily. At the same time, what is apparent to me is that the seriousness of this matter is not fully appreciated even by the Minister-designate, otherwise he would answer the question of the hon. Member for Newcastle upon this very important matter to the owners of the coastwise services. I am quite aware that when Clause 4 was abandoned that Sub-sections (	<i>e</i>) and (	<i>f</i>) were to some extent reserved—and I say very definitely to some extent, because the Minister-designate clearly told the House, in reply to the right hon. Member for Belfast, that he had no intention—I am not using the exact words, because I have not looked at the OFFICIAL REPORT—of controlling shipping services. I take the view that, Clause 4 going out of the Bill as it did—and the Bill becoming of a temporary instead of a permanent nature—I can do nothing here which would enable the Minister to do anything that he asks for under the present Clause, except in regard to railway wagons, and in a modified way to the establishment of services; and those services only to last until the end of two years. It is monstrous to say that at the end of two years the whole that has happened before by the establishment of the services will be lost. That can always be provided for before the service starts. The Minister takes power by which he can arrange for the transfer of such services to other "statutory bodies.
	<span class='label label-info column'>992</span>
So clearly and definitely did the Minister-designate say upon the Second Reading that it was not his intention to do anything of a permanent nature on the lines 1 have indicated, that I made up my mind to reserve my vote on that particular point until the question goes down to the House upon the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, 1 could not be here this morning, and I am sorry to hear that the Government have announced that they do not intend to accept this Amendment. I do not want to repeat the arguments already used. The situation seems to me an extremely simple one. Under the original Bill there was in Clause 4 the power to make all these matters permanent, but on the Second Reading objection was taken to giving that power to the Minister, and it was said that the power under this Bill—with the exception of the power setting up the office of the Ministry, which was to be permanent—was to be entirely temporary. Therefore I was very much surprised when I saw the new Clause put down in the name of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Cambridge. If this Clause is passed without this Amendment, what will arise? Instead of this Bill being a temporary Bill, with the exception of the part setting up the Minister's office and personnel—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the purchase of wagons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not at the moment talking of that, and, with all due deference, I do not see what that has to do with it. It was said in the House that wagons were to be the property of the Government, and that they would have to have an Act of Parliament to decide what to do with them. I think it is rather a clumsy thing, because really it is part of a Bill intended by the Government to be permanent but afterwards altered into a temporary measure. It arises from the action of the Government entirely, and therefore it is a matter with which I have no concern. With regard to this particular Clause, see what might happen. We were told that no provisions of a permanent kind were to be undertaken without the consent of Parliament and that a limit was to be introduced. As the Clause stands, the limits is £1,000,000. What is to prevent the Minister purchasing any number of ships up to £1,000,000, calling it a scheme and establishing it in a certain place? They
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>993</span>
do not go to Parliament for that. It is permanent. But it interferes with trade and the investment of capital made by people who did not suppose powers of this kind would be called for. That is a permanent scheme, and they can go on increasing it so long as they do not spend more than £999,999 19s. Even with the increased price of ships you could get ten or more coasting vessels for £1,000,000. They might be put on at every port in the Kingdom and called a separate scheme, and at the end of two years the Government might say, "We are not going to do anything with regard to the existing lines of steamers, but we are going to keep these on to compete with private individuals."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be impossible to start from every port because the railway companies have not got powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are the railway companies concerned? I do not think they are. The Clause says, "Any extension thereof." If those words were left out there might be something in the argument. I am not a lawyer and I know very little of the phraseology of Bills, but I must say I am a little suspicious of this, because it seems to me that very great powers might be given. As far as I can make out it might even go further than that. Would it not be possible to establish new services and harbours on the very plea the right hon. Gentleman has just used—that it was necessary for transport services if the railway companies have not got the docks? And these things would be permanent. It might be argued that the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"Unless authorised to do so by Order in Council"</p></blockquote>
would be some sort of safeguard, but I venture to say that that was not intended by Parliament when they objected to Clause 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That relates only to over a million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That only relates to over a million or where land has to be acquired. It might be held that that is some sort of a safeguard, but I venture to say it is not. What was intended by the House on the Second Reading was that where schemes were to be made permanent there should be a proper Bill to be discussed properly by the House of Commons, not these hole-and corner things
	<span class='label label-info column'>994</span>
like Orders lying on the Table of the House for a certain number of days, or Resolutions being passed when half of the Members are sitting on Committees, and the other half do not know what is going on. For that is not an unusual circumstance in these days. It is not the fault of the Members. The Government is trying to make them do more than is in their power to do. I trust that the Government will strictly in the spirit, as well as in the letter, adhere to the undertaking given by the Leader of the House on the Second Reading, that this was to be a temporary measure, and a temporary measure only, and that any attempt to make it a permanent measure or any part of it a permanent measure, except so far as is set up by the Committee, will not be persisted in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Government are not prepared to accept this Amendment, I should like to know how long the Bill is to continue. We have been told, "This is a temporary measure," and we are being told here by the Minister-designate, "You must not ask me to formulate my schemes. I cannot give you the cut and dried policy at the present time, because this is only in a state of transition; we are asking for powers for two years, and in some cases for some months afterwards." The Minister-designate stated with regard to running the steamers and that sort of thing, that they do not propose to delete the words "any extension thereof." My right hon. Friend knows you get a through Bill of Lading and a through route from place to place. You have no limitation as to what the railways can do. I cannot see any measure with which you could not purchase steamers, and you put them under railway control. We are going to increase the fleet of these various railway companies by the acquisition of steamers of a large tonnage. If we knew this was going to be in operation for the period for which it was brought in originally, we should not have perhaps quite so many misgivings. It was my duty to point out these possibilities; but when the Government take up the attitude and say, "We are not going to limit the time," you will perfectly realise that we begin to feel suspicious as to what is in the back of the heads of the Government. I stated, for instance, that under the regulations of the railway you are not limited as to what extent you may be able to go into;the carrying trade. Our big shipping businesses are built up by business acumen and the knowledge and training of the people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>995</span>
connected with the industry. We, who know something of shipping, realise full well that in the early years of the Twentieth Century it was only by the actual knowledge of every point connected with the shipping industry that the ship-owner was able to make good. The ship-owners in many cases had to give up business despite their vast knowledge. I cannot possibly conceive, therefore, how the Ministers at Whitehall, without having had that business training, can be expected to bring satisfactory results. I must congratulate the Government on having shown recently a little more desire to meet the wants of the Committee. I hope my right hon. Friend will look into this matter and say, as far as he is concerned, that he is prepared to limit the time. If he says two years is too short a period, we will say, "What do you want—three years?" And if he says "Three years," as far as I am concerned, I shall be prepared to support the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment is of the utmost importance, because it is bringing out clearly that the Minister who, all through the Committee stage, has been telling us that it is only a temporary measure to last two years, with possibly an extension for eighteen months—it is bringing out that the Government is trying to get a measure of a permanent character in regard to many parts of the Bill. I want to call attention to a portion of Clause 11, which has been referred to many times. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this Act the expression 'Government Department' includes any Government or other public Department and any Minister of the Crown acting as the head of a Government Department."</p></blockquote>
From that it is perfectly clear than whatever the Minister does, if the Government is taking powers to promote new services, it is the Government who are going to promote new transport services. It brings us to this: We have had three to four years of Government management of shipping. The Government management of shipping for a month or two months would have ruined any private shipowners because of the mistakes they have made and the reckless manner in which they have dealt with the business. There is no one connected with ships who is not sick and tired of the Government management of ships. We were told in the House that the Government had no intention of taking
	<span class='label label-info column'>996</span>
up any question of extension in shipping services under this Bill. By this very Clause the Government has power, to my mind, to enter into schemes for opening new transports from China to Peru or the North Pole to the South Pole—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Really, there is no such power in the Bill, either from ports where railway companies have powers, or any statutory extension thereof.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister himself cannot define what the statutory powers are. He is aware that the different railway companies have gone far beyond simple cross-Channel services. In conjunction with shipowners they have opened up new schemes. He knows perfectly well that a railway has been running steamers to Norway, and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway has opened out services, and so, to a lesser extent, has the Great Central. We want a definition as to what these powers are. As the Bill stands, they can undoubtedly open these new services as they like, at their own sweet will, and it is that that we want to prevent. We want to prevent any further extension of the period under which the Government is to manage our ships. They have made a terrible mess of it, and landed the country into millions and millions of loss, and we want it clearly set out what it is the Government wants to be at. I have challenged the right hon. Gentleman to tell us. The object of sending a Bill to the Committee is to consider the details of the Bill, and the more we consider them the easier we make the passage of the Bill through the House. Unless we get this information it will be our duty, when the Bill comes to the House, to get it then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WIGNALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One is bound to utter some form of protest against all the insinuations thrown out as to the intention of the Government, the manoeuvring of the Government, the scheming of the Government, and all the other strange and mysterious things the Government intend to do. We new Members, when we hear the statements of the older ones, are a little puzzled as to whether we have got into a den of thieves. I think I am expressing the sentiments of my colleagues that we thought that we were getting into the councils of the best and most honest men in the country, and that all business would be transacted in a way that would remove that element of suspicion we have heard so much about during the time we have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>997</span>
been on this Committee. We know what the working of a railway service is, and we know that attached to a railway service there is bound to be a cross-Channel service, and there is bound to be some carrying power, but to modify and extend that into a sea service—as somebody has said, but I cannot quote the figures that my right hon. Friend has so aptly quoted; it was something about a shilling short of a million that would be utilised for something that is not provided for at all in the Bill—considering these things you all seem to be full of fear as to how you are going to be tricked. I believe the Bill is specific enough, and I am against limiting the powers as provided by this Clause, because I am one of the hopeful ones to-day, believing that the two-years' experimental stage will be an all-sufficient justification to make it a more permanent stage altogether. We shall support the Government, because we feel that they are honest in their intentions, and that there is no desire to go beyond the powers set forth in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I had overlooked what was said in the House, and which my hon. Friend the Member lor Twickenham brought to my notice. In view of what I said there, I feel it would be improper of me to urge the Committee to agree to passing words which would make this power of construction, the installation of new services, a permanent one. I feel I must leave that to the judgment of the Committee and later on, if it is decided to raise it again, to the judgment of the House on Report stage. But as regards services which have been commenced I think there, not even in the words which were used downstairs in my reply nor in the judgment of this Committee, would it be wise to limit the operation of the services to two years if they have been instituted during the period. When a service has been instituted during the two years, if it was to come to an end, or might come to an end, at the close of two years it would introduce really a bar to action because if one is going to introduce a service at all, let us say a light railway service or a road service, it would be almost impossible during the first year or two to make it 	<i>per se</i> justify its existence. These services are run in expectation of success after a Jew years. Therefore, if there was a possibility of. Parliament negativing the services entirely or of the services having to
	<span class='label label-info column'>998</span>
lapse because the necessary powers had not been obtained it would be almost impossible to do anything in the way of new services under the Act. So I urge the Committee to let the Clause pass debarring the Minister at this stage at any rate from commencing any new service after the two years during which the matter is under consideration—the whole question of transportation—but I urge the Committee not to limit the running of this service to the two years because that will practically sterilise the power, and if that view was accepted by the Committee I have a proviso which I will read so that hon. Members will see what I suggest. It is proposed to put in at the end of line 28:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister shall not after the expiration of two years from the passing of this Act, unless Parliament otherwise determine, commence the construction of any new works."</p></blockquote>
That is to enable the work that is in course of construction to be finished—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Or provide equipment for any transport service not already established before that date."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WEAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest the right hon. Gentleman should add other words. The Clause deals with three things—establishing, acquiring, and constructing. The Amendment only deals with one of these three things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought the acquisition of land would be covered by it because if you are not to start construction it would cover the acquisition of land, and in any case, unless the land was acquired by agreement, it would have to come before Parliament for a Resolution of both Houses, but I have no objection to putting in the words "acquisition of land" if they are considered necessary. I was told by the draftsman he thought it was really covered. As to establishment it is difficult to say what establishment is. When yon put a time-limit to it it creates a difficulty. Does one establish a service when one cuts the first rod or when the last lick of paint is put on the last constructed building</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. NEAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the word is better out of the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As long as there is no time limit it does not seem to create a difficulty, but when you put a time limit in it creates difficulties, and that is why I used the words "a Minister shall not after the expiration of two years after the passing of the Act, unless Parliament
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>999</span>
otherwise determines, commence the construction." It was to prevent beginning anything new after that time. The checks that Parliament has upon that sort of undertakings if they were being commenced just before the end of the two years is the money limit and the fact, which is a very important one, that before you can acquire the land you have to come to Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry to differ from my right hon. Friend. The suggestion that has been made that we think the Government is a den of thieves or anything of that kind is impossible and improper. I think I have dealt fairly with the right hon. Gentleman throughout the course of the discussions; but here we have a distinct Parliamentary bargain, and he has no right to ask this Committee at this stage to give him power to run transport services for more than two years. He must go back to the House of Commons to do that. It is quite clear that the bargain did not relate to the establishment only, but to the working. I have an old copy of the Bill before it was amended, and in Clause 4, paragraph (	<i>f</i>), there was power to establish, maintain, and work transport services by land or water. That was definitely and deliberately agreed to be transferred from the permanent to the temporary portion of the Bill. There is no question about it. The right hon. Gentleman does not dispute it. His words are as plain as can be—
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is proposed to transfer the powers in Clause 4, Sub-section (	<i>f</i>), which were permanent powers, and make them temporary powers under Clause 3."</p></blockquote>
That is a Parliamentary bargain. It was a statement to the House of Commons upon which the House of Commons passed the Second Reading. There were many of us who were against the Second Reading because we foresaw a large development of Socialist enterprise under the provisions of this Bill. It may be right or wrong, but Parliament has not sanctioned it. Parliament has deliberately omitted, by agreement, the power to establish and to run for more than two years, and in reply to myself, when I asked, "What are you going to do with these institutions you have established in the two years?" the right hon. Gentleman was frank again—
	<br><blockquote><p>"They will belong to the Government. The Government will have to seek powers at the end of two years in order to deal with them."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1000</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To deal with the whole transportation question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite! That is the point. My right hon. Friend has to come back to Parliament, admittedly, at the end of two years, in order to deal with the whole transportation question. Let me say what he could so. Under the provisions of the Clause he could perfectly easily establish a motor omnibus and a motor luggage transport service in every town in the Kingdom, competing with every line of suburban railways, with every line of existing tramway or omnibus services, or with Carter, Paterson, and things of that kind. It might be right that Parliament should authorise him to do that, but Parliament has not done it. Parliament has distinctly said, so far as we have got, that he shall not do it for more than two years, and then he shall come back to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not making any reflection upon my right hon. Friend, but I say quite frankly that he ought as a Minister of the Crown to abide by his own words and to say quite candidly: "I admit that I said in the House of Commons more than I intended to say. I admit that I went further in limiting myself than I meant to limit myself, but I am bound by what I said in the House of Commons and I will withdraw the provisions of this Clause, from the Committee, and boldly go to the House of Commons on Report stage and ask them to give me the powers I want." That would be the honest and straightforward course, and one which I think my right hon. Friend on reflection will carry out. Then it would be for Parliament to say whether he is to have those powers or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RENWICK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was pleased to hear the very conciliatory tone of the right hon. Gentleman's speech. So far as shipping interests are concerned we should be satisfied to leave the existing services carried on by the railways. It would be a difficult matter to cut them off. If the right hon. Gentleman will give an undertaking that during the next two years he is not going to commence any new transport service overseas but to carry on the existing services of the railway companies then I think the shipping interests would be satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Committee are very much obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for the conciliatory way

	<span class='label label-info column'>1001</span>
in which he has met their arguments. There may possibly be something to be said for his proposal, but speaking as an old Member of the House I would ask him to remember that it has always been the custom of the House to abide by Parliamentary bargains. There is nothing that has ever been more sacred than a Parliamentary bargain, whether it is given in private conversation or across the floor of the House. Under the circumstances I do not think there can be any question that a Parliamentary bargain was entered into, and I think it would be very much better if the right hon. Gentleman would accept the Amendment, at the same time stating that he holds himself at liberty on the Report stage to acquaint the House with what has taken place and to ask them whether, in the circumstances, as they are the people with whom the bargain was made, they will approve of the suggestion which he has just made to us. Then we shall be able to get on with the Bill. The Bill has to go back to the House in any case. My proposal does not prevent the right hon. Gentleman making the proposal to the House which he has just made, but I think it does preserve what I attach far more importance to than any question as to what particular industry is going to be affected, namely, it does preserve the sanctity of Parliamentary bargains. If we begin to break the sanctity of Parliamentary bargains it will be a serious matter. My hon. Friends will confirm my statement that I have had a great deal to do with Parliamentary bargains with a result that has been most satisfactory to everybody. I wish in the most solemn way to deprecate the breaking of Parliamentary bargains as being one of the most fatal things that could be done, if the business of the House of Commons is to be carried on in a successful way as in the past. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will meet us in this matter, especially as he will not in any way damage himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel in some difficulty as a comparatively young Member of the House in dealing with this matter. It is quite true that the words appear in my statement that

One was speaking in debate, and whilst I do not wish to run away from anything I have said I think later on we

If you put in the word "estimate" then there is no limit at all. The estimate is the only thing that will control him, and the ultimate cost may exceed the estimate to a very considerable extent and yet he is within the provision of the Clause. I urge that the suggestion of my right hon. Friend the Member for the City of London should be agreed to. I think it is carrying out the undertaking given in Parliament that no capital expenditure should exceed £1,000,000, and if you depart from that you give a free hand to the Minister to have estimates loosely prepared and thus to go much beyond the restriction that has been put upon him. You relieve him of a great onus by making this alteration, and I would fasten that onus on the Ministry, that they should not be allowed to undertake any service of this kind unless they keep within the limit of £1,000,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A contractor makes a contract, but 1 said an engineer or an architect, who gives an idea and puts in a kind of estimate, either to the Government or to a private person, as to what a thing will cost.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ROYCE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An engineer may be a contractor, but if the hon Baronet has not had experience of estimates not being exceeded, I could tell him of several. I remember very well one case in which an estimate was made for a railway without the fencing and the telegraph, but the carrying out of the work came so far within the contract that both were paid for out of the Estimate.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. HALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The idea of the Amendment later on, to put in the word "probable," was to get rid of this difficulty. I am afraid I cannot support the Amendment of the hon.

I hope, however, the Government will not press for the word "estimate," because I think it would lead us into very troublesome waters. It is not a question of speaking against contractors in any way, but we have had so many estimates at various times, particularly from architects, which have been greatly exceeded that we are anxious to avoid that particular difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I think £500,000 is quite enough to be spent on any one service for this two years. I think, further, the intention of the House was that a sum not exceeding £1,000,000 should be spent on the whole thing, and not £1,000,000 on any number of schemes. I do not say that there was any undertaking given to this effect, but I think that that was the understanding and the impression in the House. Possibly I may be wrong, and I am wondering whether the right hon. Gentleman would agree to accept my second Amendment if I did not move the first?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Baronet suggested £500,000, and then goes on with a proposal that we should have two bites of £500,000 each, which makes a whole cherry. I certainly did not understand in the House that it was to be a cumulative limit of £1,000,000. I do not think that that would be adequate or reasonable. Moreover, I do not think any arguments have been put forward for a reduction of the sum, and I consider there are very good reasons why it should be retained at the figure of £1,000,000 as given by the Leader of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1008</span>
the country, establishing all kinds of things at a £1,000,000 apiece. Will you not give us a limit now? The hon. Member opposite put his finger unintentionally on the blot in the Clause—although he did not mean to help us—when he let the cat out of the bag and said, "He can begin a scheme in itself at £1,000,000, and then add another. And so they could go on, and forty, fifty, sixty, and 100 millions might disappear before we knew where we were. Will not my right hon. Friend agree to a limit of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000, a good round sum, before he goes back to Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry I have to leave the Committee at once, and therefore I cannot help myself. I will withdraw this Amendment, and then move the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. BANBURY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1, 	<i>i</i>), after the word "pounds," ["one million pounds"], to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"and when the total amount spent on the whole of such services exceeds one million pounds."</p></blockquote>
I can see the Government will not accept it, but I hope the Committee will divide and show that some of us, at any rate, are inclined to see that some check is put upon the spending of money at the present time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Committee will not pass this £1,000,000 limitation. It is quite clear from what the Leader of the House said that the House was given to understand that it was £1,000,000 on any one scheme, and not a cumulative £1,000,000. What was said was this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Perhaps it may be found when the thing is discussed upstairs that some other arrangement may be better, but we contemplate in every case of expenditure of a large sum of money on any particular scheme submitting the matter to the House of Commons."</p></blockquote>
So it is clear it was intended to be £1,000,000 on any one scheme The limitation of £1,000,000 for two years would be very hampering. If the Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1919-1919V002P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1009</span>
thinks £1,000,000 is too high for any one scheme, well, I do not attach so much importance to that as to the cumulative £1,000,000. I think that if the Clause can be interpreted as authorising any subterfuge, we ought to amend it, because, obviously, that is not intended. I am not in any way wedded to the £1,000,000, and I will say quite frankly why. I would accept a reduced figure provided it was not coupled with the cumulative £1,000,000 limit. The reason is that it would be very difficult to spend £999,000 without breaking up a road or acquiring land compulsorily, in which case you would have to go to Parliament. If it would assist the Committee, I would be prepared to accept a reduction in the amount, but not a cumulative £1,000,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman I do not know—but I have always understood that one of the objects the Government has in mind is the development of the communications of agriculture. That is one of the reasons why I am so ardently in favour of the establishment of a Ministry of Communications, which will remedy this long-felt want. In the county in which I am particularly interested a series of schemes have been advocated which will involve the expenditure of £600,000 alone. I would like to ask the Minister-designate if these schemes came within the compass of his thoughts when he said he was prepared to accept a lower sum than £1,000,000 for one undertaking? These schemes have been submitted to the authorities of the county, and they think the schemes are good, highly remunerative, and very beneficial. But can they be carried out if the Minister is limited to £500,000? A million sterling spread all over the country would be simply playing with the promises of the Prime Minister. How is it possible with such a sum to carry out the promises made to the country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The object of this Amendment is to introduce what is desired by some of the local authorities—the opportunity of stating their case, which they do not possess under the Bill as it is. My Amendment proposes to leave out certain words, but that will be met by a Clause put down later which covers what is

	<span class='label label-info column'>1011</span>
necessary. This Clause is founded on the latest action of the Houses of Parliament in connection with procedure of this description. In 1918 there was passed the Land Drainage Act, and the procedure adopted there is followed in the Clause I have down later on. I have a very strong prejudice against procedure by Order in Council. I know you are told that it has to lic so many days on the Table, and then you can bring up your petition and get a vote of the House. But from a long acquaintance with the House, I think it is a most unfortunate procedure for those who desire to challenge the action of a Department. It is only on the most exceptional occasions that it is possible, after the ordinary business of the House, to raise the point you desire - against an Order in Council. I know the Minister will say that what I am trying to set up is very cumbersome machinery. It does not follow that the notices which are given from the new Department, and which appeared in the "Gazette," would necessarily be challenged. He may say that owing to the concession he made this morning in regard to the new Advisory Committees, he has conceded to local authorities something they did not enjoy previously. I realise that it has admitted them to a position they previously did not hold under the Bill. I should like to know what class of representation he will give to local urban councils and the metropolitan corporations on these Committees, because that may to a large extent meet the object for which this Amendment was drafted.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. Can we possibly decide as to this, before the moving of a new Clause, to which this is purely consequential? The hon.

This new Clause is a momentous one, and would so hamper the operation of anything done under the Bill that it would mean delay in practically every case. I hardly see how the Committee can decide on this consequential Amendment until it has dealt with the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<li>After an Order has been settled by the Minister, it shall be published in such manner as he thinks best adapted for informing persons affected with notice that he has settled the Order, and that the Order will become final and have effect as an Act of Parliament unless within such period, not being less than thirty days, as may be stated in the notice, a memorial is presented to the Minister by some person or body affected by the Order.</li>
	<li>If no memorial has been presented against the Order within such period as aforesaid, or if every such memorial has been withdrawn, the Minister shall make the Order, and the Order shall thereupon have effect as if enacted in this Act, but if any such memorial has been presented, and has not been withdrawn the Order shall be provisional only, and shall have no effect unless and until confirmed by Parliament.</li>
	<li>The Minister may submit to Parliament for confirmation any Provisional Order made by him in pursuance of this Act.</li>
	<li>If, while the Bill confirming any such Order is pending in either House of Parliament, a petition is presented against any Order comprised therein the Bill, so far as it relates to such Order, may be referred to a Select Committee and the Petitioner shall be allowed to appear and oppose as in the case of Private Bills."</li></ol></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the expression of opinion by the Minister, perhaps the hon. Member would desire to reserve himself until he comes to the point when he is going to move his Clause</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ROWLANDS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason the Amendment was put down was to clear the way for the Clause. There was no other way of meeting it. It requires the Amendment before the Clause will be in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite realise what the Minister has said. It is better that we should debate the whole question of Orders in Council on the new Clause. If the Minister would leave out the words following the words "Order in Council" that would make it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that that would mutilate the present Clause and if, by chance, the Committee did not

	<span class='label label-info column'>1013</span>
approve of the Clause to be moved by my hon. Friend (Mr. Rowlands) you would have a mutilated Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must have the Amendment negatived or withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ROWLANDS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave the Minister a chance, I think. I asked him to give me some idea as to concessions, and I thought he would have taken the opportunity of saying something, and then I was going to consider whether I would maintain the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I venture to suggest it is impossible for any Member of the Committee to vote on this matter on its merits, until he has heard the full explanations of the hon. Member on the new Clause which comes on later. But if after hearing those explanations the Committee should decide in favour of adopting his new Clause, then, in order to make the Bill comprehensive and coherent it would be possible for him, on the Report stage, to move the deletion of those words which are now before the Committee. There is no other way under Parliamentary and Committee procedure of dealing with the matter, and my hon. Friend, perhaps, will see fit to withdraw the Amendment on the understanding that he will not be prejudicing his position later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1, 	<i>i</i>), to leave out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"a draft whereof has been approved by a Resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament,"</p></blockquote>
and to insert instead thereof the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"made as hereinafter provided."</p></blockquote>
I think this is a better plan, as it puts my hon. Friend's Amendment straight. We want to define the way in which Orders in Council should be made. I agree with my hon. Friend that we do not want at this moment to discuss in the middle of this Clause the intricacies of a Clause on Orders in Council. I think, therefore, it would be well if we adopted this Amendment,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir R. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest that the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham are the same as those of the Amendment we have just had withdrawn? After the explanation of the hon. Member opposite (Sir F. Flannery) it is impossible, I suggest, for the Committee to vote on this Amendment.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1014</span>
It is impossible for the Committee to come to any considered decision on it until they have considered the new Clause in the name of the hon. Member (Mr. Rowlands), and what the hon. Member for Twickenham has now asked the Minister-designate to do is to take out from his Clause these words which rather explain how the Order in Council is to be obtained—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right, I withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, after Sub-section (4), to add,
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5) Before any Order in Council under Subsection (4) of this Section is made, notice of the proposal to make the Order and of the place where copies of a draft of the Order can be obtained shall be published in the London, Edinburgh, or Dublin Gazette, as the case may require, and in such other manner as the Minister thinks best adapted for insuring publicity, and a draft of the Order shall be laid before each House of Parliament for not less than thirty days on which such House is sitting, and the Order shall not be made until both Houses by Resolution have approved the draft or except subject to any modifications and adaptations which may be agreed to by both Houses."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure that this Amendment can go in its present form, because it does not conform to the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My Amendment, as proposed by Mr. Joynson-Hicks, and withdrawn, was not passed. I think I am subjected to injustice there, because I never got the chance of moving it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I called your name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir W. RAEBURN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not hear you. I am sorry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>Clause, as amended, added to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir E. GEDDES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made a great deal of progress to-day, and have arrived at the end of a Clause. The new Clause which I shall be moving next is a very big subject, and I suggest that the Committee may find it desirable to adjourn now, and to start the new Clause at the next meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Motion made, and Question, "That the Committee do now adjourn," put, and agreed to.</p>
	<p>Adjourned accordingly at Twelve minutes before Six o'clock until Tuesday, 20th May, at 11 a.m.</p>
