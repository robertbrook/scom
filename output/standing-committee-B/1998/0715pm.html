New clause 6</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'The Agency shall define and publish quantifiable criteria of its performance and shall include performance against those criteria in each annual report to Parliament.'.—[<i>Mr. Paice.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed [this day],</i> That the clause be read a Second time.</p>
<p>1.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Public Health (Ms Tessa Jowell)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we adjourned, I was answering the various points made by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) and the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean). I referred to the inclusion in clause 4 of a reference to the agency preparing a report on its activities and performance, following the recommendation of the Special Select Committee. I said that we intended that the agency's annual report should not be self-centred or congratulatory, but be a rigorous assessment of the agency's performance and achievements.<br><br>
The key issue raised by new clause 6 is how the agency's performance might be measured. We entirely agree about the importance of a transparent benchmarking of progress in such an important area of public health policy. It is important that the performance of the agency should be measurable, but we need to ensure that we measure the right factors. We have already discussed measuring the reduction in the level of food-borne illness, which might be an attractive and tangible way to gauge the agency's performance. However, the general view is that such a measurement might be unhelpful; we hope that the agency will not only tackle the causes of food-borne illness but ensure a more rigorous and systematic notification of it. One of the great public health problems in tracking the epidemiology of many food-borne illnesses is that reporting is erratic. We seek to rectify that.<br><br>
I expect in the first instance that two performance measurements will be process measurements and specific outcome measurements. I hope that the agency will seek to engage the public in that debate. Every Department is accountable for delivering performance against its public service agreement. MAFF has a clear target to establish the Food Standards Agency and put in place a system to measure its performance in a way that will contribute to food safety. The public service agreement framework already provides one such yardstick.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 356</span>
The sort of performance measurements that we would expect the FSA to take unto itself could be classified under such headings as "Progress in promoting HACCP" and "Quality of expert advice provided by the advisory committees". I hope that there will be some scrutiny of the proportionate nature of the exercise of the agency's powers. That will be one of the board's early jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mark Todd <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Derbyshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: One critical way to measure effectiveness could be to measure the agency's work against the achievements of similar organisations. One of the agency's first tasks might be to find a basis for making that comparison, so that one could examine the performance of the FSA against that of similar bodies in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that suggestion. It is certainly an area of comparative study, but the caveat must always be that conclusions about similarity should be based on comparisons of like with like.<br><br>
I sought to indicate the broad territory within which I would expect the FSA board to consider the early targets against which performance could be measured and how they would appear in the annual report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kevin Barron <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rother Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend will know that the Special Select Committee made a specific recommendation that the agency's annual report should state its annual progress not only on food safety, but on raising dietary and nutritional standards. I accept that the FSA will be independent, but can citizens expect to see those latter indicators included in the annual report?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The agency may seek to collect and publish that sort of information. For instance, the food survey run by MAFF, which will be taken over by the agency, provides a means of tracking national changes in the pattern of diet. That is clearly at the boundary, but it is the sort of information that the agency will collect and disseminate on the status of diet and the broader public health role of the Department of Health which we examined earlier.<br><br>
In addition to the agency engaging the public in the development of performance measures, we would expect the annual report to be just that—a report on progress. As we made clear, the Select Committees will rightly be interested in it, and will want to exercise their power of scrutiny. Parliament, too, will no doubt want to debate the agency's report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Following on from the important comments of the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd), is the right hon. Lady aware that the National Audit Office, as scrutinised by the Public Accounts Committee, already does a huge amount of work in comparing various agencies in respect of performance indicator levels? The agency will be involved in a huge range of performance indicator levels. Will the Minister make it clear that she expects the agency to work closely with the National Audit Office in its excellent work?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can easily give that assurance. I would expect that to be to the benefit of the efficient running of the agency.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0646">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 357</span>
I have outlined the functions for which I expect the agency to identify its performance measures, and some of the pitfalls associated with doing so; the possible benefits of adopting measures for both process and outcomes; and the importance of the annual report in rigorously and self-critically recording progress against targets. I have described the other elements of parliamentary scrutiny that will be brought to bear on the agency's performance.<br><br>
I conclude by reiterating a point that I hope is beyond all doubt. We expect the agency to define and publish its performance measures—what the public are receiving, or, as the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) said, how the taxpayer's money is being spent. Making public that assessment of progress in meeting targets will be an important means of engaging the public in the discharge of the agency's functions.<br><br>
Having dealt at some length with the case made in the new clause, having put much of the Government's thinking on the matter on the record and having made clear our wish that the nature of the targets should not be specified in the Bill but that we expect targets to be set, I hope that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire will see fit to withdraw the motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Paice <span class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Cambridgeshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for her response to the new clause and for the constructive way in which she has approached it. However, if everything is as good as she describes, I cannot understand the argument for not specifying the requirement in the Bill. In concluding, she made a remark about not wanting targets to be specified in the Bill. No one is proposing that the nature of the targets should be specified in the Bill. We merely propose that the agency should be required to establish and publish them. The Minister said that she "hopes and expects" that the agency will do that. I am not sure that that is sufficiently strong. It should be required to do so. I do not deny that public service agreements such as those from which she quoted are useful, but they are not the same as a publicly declared obligation on the agency, which would be the result of specifying the requirement in the Bill.<br><br>
Having said that, we still have a little more work to do in considering the Bill, and I do not want to delay the Committee. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

New clause 10</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
DUTIES OF THE AGENCY IN RELATION TO FOOD SUPPLEMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'.—(1) The Agency shall define what constitutes a food in accordance with section 1 of the 1990 Act.
<ol>
<li>The Agency shall decide what foods or food products are to be classified as food supplements in accordance with the definition in subsection (5).</li>
<li>The Agency may refer food supplements to the Medicines Control Agency to decide whether or not they should be submitted to the licensing authority for medicinal products to determine whether they should be licensed as medicines.</li>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 358</span>
<li>Where a food supplement which has been referred under subsection (3) is not subsequently licensed as a medicine, the Agency shall retain responsibility for all regulatory matters relating to that food supplement.</li>
<li>In this section, "food supplement" means food, in the form of a capsule, tablet, powder or liquid, which—</li>
<ol>
<li>contains any vitamin, mineral, fatty acids or amino acids,</li>
<li>if consumed, would supplement the intake of vitamins, minerals, fatty acids or amino acids from the diet,</li>
<li>is not a significant source of energy, and -</li>
<li>is not specifically claimed to have the property of preventing, treating or curing a human disease.'.—<i>[Dr. Brand.]</i></li>
</ol></ol></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Peter Brand <span class='memberconstituency'>(Isle of Wight)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
I thought that it would be useful to take the opportunity that the Bill offers to clear up a grey area in the definition of food, foodstuffs, food supplements and borderline substances related to food. No doubt every member of the Committee has, like me, received letters about the threat that the Medicines Control Agency apparently poses to some traditional herbal remedies and food and mineral supplements.<br><br>
I have no problem with the MCA's stepping in when a specific medical claim is made for a substance, no matter what it be, because by definition that would constitute a description of a medicine, so it is necessary to establish whether it does any good or, more important, whether it may do harm. However, I am worried that the MCA appears to have the power to act as prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner.<br><br>
We now have an opportunity to build in some checks and balances. I am not suggesting that the FSA should control the MCA, but the FSA would be an appropriate vehicle to screen out references to the MCA, as would happen under new clause 10. The Minister for Public Health has said that that is a grey area, and we now have an opportunity to deal with it without further legislation.</span></p>
<p>1.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Several members of the Committee have shown considerable interest in food supplement issues in recent months, and I pay tribute to their diligence. I responded to an Adjournment debate, initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire, to which the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) contributed.<br><br>
There is a frustrating problem with timing. My noble Friend Baroness Hayman, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, will make an announcement tomorrow about the proposals that follow from the extensive consultation on borderline products—those which are neither obviously food, as defined in the Food Safety Act 1990, nor obviously medicines, as defined in the Medicines Act 1968. I urge the hon. Member for Isle of Wight to withdraw the motion, but I know that Baroness Hayman has been inundated with more or less well-informed representations about the proposals and that she will seek to put the record straight tomorrow.<br><br>
I know that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight is especially concerned about the role of the MCA. He
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0647">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 359</span>
will know—this has been announced in another place—that, following consultation, the intention is to establish a review panel. That panel will consider decisions about borderline products and its members will be independent of the MCA. I know from the interventions that the hon. Gentleman made in that Adjournment debate that he is concerned that the MCA might act as both judge and jury, and I can give him an assurance on that point. I hope that the announcement that Baroness Hayman will make tomorrow will provide greater clarity.<br><br>
The Committee will be aware that food is defined in the Food Safety Act 1990 and that medicines are defined in the Medicines Act 1968. Under that legislation, the crucial Rubicon is that a food becomes a medicine is if it produces a pharmacological change or if medical claims are made about it.<br><br>
I do not underestimate the extent to which such matters will be an area of constant judgment and refinement in the months and years to come, especially as more foods that have a medicinal effect— "functional foods" is the term—come on to the market.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that all food is functional and has an effect, as demonstrated clearly by some of us? Does she accept, too, that all foods have a pharmacological—indeed, a physiological effect? Otherwise, it would not be food, although air has a pharmacological effect. The legal definition that the Minister keeps quoting does not help us to sort out that grey area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must accept that that is the definition against which the Medicines Control Agency will make those judgments, as the law presently stands. He gave two rather frivolous examples of how difficult those judgments could be at times.<br><br>
To address the background to the amendment and register the Government's recognition that it is an important issue of public concern, a forthcoming announcement will be made about the consultation to which the hon. Gentleman referred specifically. I underline and reiterate what I said before that there is no intention to alter the borderline between food and medicine, which is already defined by EU law. The proposals on which the MCA has been consulting are concerned only with the way in which the existing law is enforced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Todd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister kindly referred to the Adjournment debate that I led on this subject. I look forward with much interest to the announcement tomorrow, although today's events may mean that I shall not be immediately available to receive it. My right hon. Friend has not touched on the fundamental principle of that debate, but we have referred to it a number of times in our discussions on this Bill. I refer to consumer choice and proportionality, which lay at the heart of the debate on vitamins and supplements. People should be able to make up their own minds, provided there is no demonstration that the substances that they choose
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 360</span>
are harmful and that false claims are not made that they are provided for medicinal purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the case if products do not cross the boundary between a food supplement and a medicine. My hon. Friend will be aware that our advisory committees and, indeed, the MCA are vigilant in scrutinising the literature and receiving representations in the event of evidence of harm. The public expect us to examine any evidence of harm and to act if it is proven. That is the protective public health role that people look to the Government, and the Department of Health in particular, to discharge. For the reasons that I have set out to the Committee, and in view of the forthcoming announcement which deals specifically with the reasons for tabling it, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdrawing the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When faced with a problem that one is trying to tidy up, it is always difficult to be offered a solution tomorrow when one might be available today. We have clearly demonstrated that the present legislation is extremely flawed and that the present set-up is not seen to be as open, accessible and proportional as the new food agency will be. Our debates have been very much about openness and accountability, which is not something for which the MCA, expert though it is, is famous. I therefore suggested that an amendment or a new clause along the lines of new clause 10 might help to restore public confidence and help people feel that there were proper checks and balances in this controlling mechanism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman sits down, we need to consider more carefully one aspect of what the Minister said about some of the products being on the borderline between foods and medicines. Is he not concerned by her comment that some claims for products may make them medicines? For centuries, people have said that drinking feverfew cures boils, warts, hair loss and other complaints. If we remove traditional claims, such as have been made for common herbs and plants, and say that those are medicinal claims and that those products must now be evaluated according to medicine control standards, are we not looking at £10 million-worth of research— which will be wiped out if those traditional claims are not permitted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman makes an interesting illustrative point. I think that Mars bars should be referred to the MCA because great claims have been made about their efficacy in putting right all sorts of things. As I understand it, the MCA need not take any action unless a specific claim is made that a traditional substance will cure a specific disease. The claim must be made clearly by the manufacturer or retailer of the product, rather than by people writing to magazines or newspapers to say that taking feverfew makes migraines better and periods easier, or whatever. We understand where the borderline ought to be there.<br><br>
It worries me that the MCA seems to be able to trawl and to decide itself what it wants to investigate on very lax criteria. If we take the definition of a medicine as given by the Minister, it can investigate any substance should it so wish. The amendment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0648">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 361</span>
which is, dare I say it, conservatively drafted, does not put a brake on the MCA other than the need for it to work through the FSA. We are, of course, discussing food and food additives—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I have received wonderful instructions in writing that is even less clear than my own—and that is saying something. I gather that other Committee members want to discuss the new clause, so I shall end my remarks.</span></p>
<p>2 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Isle of Wight for making room for others by concluding his discourse. We all know that doctors have a reputation for illegible writing, but it appears that other Committee members may compete with him for that title.<br><br>
We were interested by the Minister's response. We feel that it is inappropriate to have a detailed discussion of dietary supplements until we know the outcome of the review. When we debated the matter on 10 March, it was pointed out that the Select Committee had recommended a wide review of the difficult and detailed subject of dietary and food supplements and of the substances that are on the borderline between food and drugs.<br><br>
As we clearly stated on 10 March, we want as light a touch as possible in the regulatory regime for such dietary supplements. That must be consistent, of course, with the safety of the consumer. Public safety has to be the paramount concern.<br><br>
Many of the substances that are under review have been in existence for a long time, and many of them do not fall under the modern, new and racy definition of functional food—they are well known and well loved traditional remedies or supplements, which may be taken as part of a diet. Such substances are produced by established firms, many of which are small but make an important contribution to the economy.<br><br>
Any regulatory change must preserve people's continued access to existing products from that diverse range of suppliers, who must compete in the same marketplace. Regulatory change should be introduced only if there is clear and compelling scientific evidence that such products are unsafe. It is important for the sake of small and larger suppliers, and the many individuals who are familiar with such products and who may have used them for a long time—I am sure that all Committee members have received letters from such people on this subject—that compelling scientific evidence should be the only reason for introducing regulatory change. We look forward to Baroness Hayman's announcement tomorrow—it may inform our further debate of this matter. For the purposes of today's discussion, it is right to wait for the announcement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always easier to argue for regulation than for its absence. I do not believe that the issues surrounding supplements and dietary aids are necessarily black and white, and the Minister and the Government should not treat them such. Perhaps we should consider introducing a third category:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 362</span>
dietary aids and aromatherapy and herbal products could be treated not as a medicine or a food but as a supplement. They would not then be subject to the same regulations or, for example, the same requirements for efficacy, that apply to substances that are classed as medicines. Labelling may make it possible to avoid some of the legal pitfalls that would result from these substances being defined as medicine.<br><br>
I know that there will be an announcement on the review tomorrow, but perhaps the review could encompass some of these proposals. Ultimately, we should be considering not whether a substance necessarily does a person any good but whether it does any harm. That is the real test. Would it cost the national health service any more if that substance were on sale?<br><br>
We should avoid the excessive regulation of an overburdening nanny state. I believe in consumer choice being as wide as possible. Such substances may not necessarily do any good, but if people buying them believe, psychologically, that they are, perhaps overall, as a nation, we are benefiting.<br><br>
I urge Ministers to look very carefully at the issue and not to rush into drafting burdensome legislation and directions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting and illuminating debate. Until we hear the announcement tomorrow, which will give us some idea of the effectiveness of the review panel, I am happy to withdraw the new clause, although we might want to return to this issue on Report. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we debate amendments to schedule 1, I should explain the arcane nature of the procedure that took place. If an hon. Member moves a new clause or amendment and then seeks leave to withdraw it, and another hon. Member seeks leave to speak afterwards, it is presumed by the Chair that leave to withdraw is not granted, and it must therefore be put to the vote. So if somebody wishes to speak, they should indicate very clearly their wish to do so before the mover is granted his or her right of reply.</span></p>

CONSTITUTION ETC. OF THE AGENCY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 141, in page 23, line 9, leave out paragraph 8 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'8.—(1) The Agency may, with the approval of the Minister for the Civil Service as to numbers and terms and conditions of service, appoint such staff as it may determine.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) Sub-paragraph (1) is subject to section 3 in the case of the chief executive and the directors for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.'.</p></blockquote>
I want to make it clear that this is purely a technical amendment; there is no agenda, hidden or otherwise. Conservative Members might think that the Government are seeking more control over agency staff. On page 38 of the White Paper published in January 1998, we made it abundantly clear in paragraph 6.22 that the Government intend the staff of the agency to be civil servants. We did not consult on that, in the same way that we did not consult on the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 363</span>
location of the headquarters because those were non-negotiable decisions. Indeed, until we consulted on some of the financial aspects of the Bill, we were perfectly content with paragraph 8. However, we have been advised that the Bill needs a reference to the Minister for the Civil Service. We have therefore rewritten paragraph 8 of schedule 1 to take account of that. It puts the status of the staff of the agency beyond any doubt.<br><br>
This is a purely technical amendment, and I hope that the Committee will accept it.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 142, in page 23, line 15, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2) The entries recorded in the register of members' interests shall be published by the Agency.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment requires the agency to publish its register of members, interests in response to commitments that we made when we were debating amendment No. 11 to clause 2. We have made it clear that We want that to happen, here is an analogy, with the Register of Members' Interests in this place. The agency register will probably be published annually, as a snapshot, in the annual report, but it will be kept up to date and always available to the public. I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the First schedule to the Bill</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not make a speech, but rise because twice today I have forgotten to mention something. It relates to the constitution of the agency, so I think that it would be okay if I talked about it for a couple of second. We have not forgotten about amendments in respect of the agency's accounts, and we shall table amendments dealing with how they will be put into the public domain. We have promised that, but we shall return to it on Report. I meant to mention that during the first debate this morning.</span></p>

THE AGENCY'S FUNCTIONS UNDER OTHER ACTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 136, in page 25, leave out lines 21 to 24.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 117, in schedule 4, page 30, line 26, leave out from 'Food'" to end of line 27.</p>
<p>No. 123, in page 30, line 29, leave out from 'omitted' to end of line 31.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a slight distinction between the amendments. Amendment No. 136 applies to schedule 3 and amendments Nos. 117 and 123 apply to schedule 4, but you have selected them for discussion together, Mr. Gale. Their approach is also slightly different: amendment No. 136 addresses directions to discharge the duties of enforcement authorities, whereas
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 364</span>
amendments Nos. 117 and 123 relate to the scope of the agency's powers, which is the point on which I shall concentrate.<br><br>
Throughout our consideration of the Bill, which is drawing to a close, two issues have received much attention. On the face of it, they could be seen as conflicting, although I do not believe that they are. The first is the power and scope of the agency and the second is its independence. It is not contradictory to say that the Opposition want the agency to be as independent as possible, but also want to limit its powers. That is the purpose of amendments Nos. 117 and 123, which would ensure that the Secretary of State continues in his or her present role and operates as an extra check and balance on the operation of the new agency. Such a role would ensure that the agency is doubly sure of its facts before it asks the Secretary of State to act.<br><br>
The Government need all the help they can get to ensure that the agency is seen to be of the highest integrity and have the highest standards. It is not scaremongering to suggest that concern exists in parts of the food industry that the scope of the agency's powers is wide enough to cause serious damage to our food production and processing industry if they are exercised in the wrong hands.<br><br>
I shall not mention the names of people who have written on this subject, but one or two have been mentioned in earlier sittings. Many people are concerned that too much power is going into the agency's hands. To add to the Food Safety Act 1990 powers for the agency that are currently with the Minister or Secretary of State—as the schedule does— would go a little too far at this stage.<br><br>
When the agency has settled down for a few years, Parliament and others will be able to see how well it has worked and to see that it has not acted in an unacceptable way; the set of transfers of responsibility before us and the introduction of additional responsibility could perhaps then be pursued. If we want the agency to be credible, we cannot afford to take risks with the initial enthusiasm of a new organisation, in which new senior staff could want to make a name for themselves, and could do so in a way that was damaging in the long term. We want to ensure that, in enforcement by the agency, the Secretary of State's accountability remains. That, too, requires close parliamentary scrutiny. The agency must ultimately be accountable. If it is given the powers in the schedule, accountability will be lacking.<br><br>
2.15 pm<br><br>
I have a particular difficulty to explain to the Committee. It relates to amendment No. 123 and, in particular, to schedule 4. Paragraph 8 on page 30 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In subsection (4) … after the word 'State,' there shall be inserted the words 'the Food Standards Agency,'".</p></blockquote>
That is what we seek to remove. It would be remiss of me not to highlight a problem, although I might be at fault, but I have a copy of the Food Safety Act 1990, which was reprinted in 1998, and having studied section 6(4), I cannot find the word "State". The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0650">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 365</span>
schedule appears to be incorrect. I have tabled amendments in good faith, but amendment No. 123 is clearly absurd if the schedule is out of order. When the Minister responds to my substantive reasons for tabling the amendments, he might also be able to decide what to do. It would be wholly improper to leave in place a schedule that was clearly technically deficient.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we embark on the debate, I should make it clear to the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire that I am aware that some of the grouped amendments refer to schedule 4. If he wants to move them separately in the appropriate manner, I will be pleased to call him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the problems with the way in which this place deals with legislation—except the Taxes Act 1988—is that we do not publish up-to-date versions of Acts of Parliament. Even if we want an up-to-date version of any Act, we cannot buy one. We have to look at the annotated versions in the Library or go to legal experts outside the House. Although the Food Safety Act is available, the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 has changed it. That explains why the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire cannot find the word in schedule 3 in his copy of the Food Safety Act. The Food Safety Act was amended, and the reference on page 30 of the Bill to section 6(4) is correct—although not as regards the printed version. In other words, the public are conned if they buy an Act of Parliament because of constant changes in the law. I am reliably informed, however, that we have got the provisions correct. Of course, if anyone can draw attention to any defect in the Bill between now and next Tuesday—that is the time in which any other amendments must be tabled—I am open to advice. If there are any technical defects, we will put them right.<br><br>
I am not sure about the effect of amendment No. 136, which would take out sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 2, because the magic words did not cross the lips of the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. If his amendment were carried, however, the Meat Hygiene Service could not become part of the Food Standards Agency. That is the reality of paragraph 2(b). Paragraph 2(a) enables the agency to be directed to discharge the duties of food authorities and to be designated as an enforcement authority.<br><br>
It is crucial that the Bill designates the agency as an enforcement agency; otherwise, it could not take over the Meat Hygiene Service. The FSA becomes an enforcement authority from day one because of the MHS becoming part of the agency—not because there is a hidden agenda for the FSA to become the national enforcement authority for food. We have clearly stated that that is not our intention, and it is not in any way, shape or form the plan for the future. The enforcement authorities will remain the local authorities—there is no dispute about that. However, the power for the agency is crucial; otherwise, the plan for the MHS would be mucked up—I realise that I have now given
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 366</span>
the game away in respect of future amendments about the MHS that will be tabled on Report.<br><br>
We made it clear in the White Paper that enforcement would remain with local authorities, and we have not deviated from that at all. I have to keep repeating that because of the erroneous reporting of our plans by highly paid, expert and respected journalists and independent food consultants—who, frankly, do not always get it right. In this case, they have got it totally wrong. I accept that that will not necessarily be reported this Sunday, but at least they might stop telling lies now that they know what the truth is. That would be a good thing, and for the greater benefit of the public, because all such reports do is frighten the food industry and local authorities by giving them the impression that the Government are not being honest in their intentions.<br><br>
Those are the central reasons why I asked the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. The other two amendments, Nos. 117 and 123, are consequential amendments, notwithstanding the hon. Gentleman's point about the apparent defect on page 30—it is an apparent defect only.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the latter two amendments are consequential on the first, and I am rather surprised that the Minister should jump to that conclusion. I look forward to him trying to rebut a little more effectively my arguments for those two amendments, rather than that for amendment No. 136 only.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 117 and 123 are consequential on amendment No. 136, which would remove from schedule 3 the powers to allow the agency to take over the work of local authorities at the Secretary of State's direction and to be nominated to carry out the enforcement of specific regulations under the Food Safety Act 1990. The aim of the two amendments is to carry through to the technical provision in schedule 4 the changes would be made by the other amendment. I understand that the two amendments were previously ruled out of order because they were not accompanied by a parallel amendment to schedule 3, and that they have now been reinstated merely because of the tabling of amendment No. 136. That is why we cannot accept the amendments.<br><br>
Schedule 3 makes changes in a non-textual form. Schedule 4 merely amends the wording of the 1990 Act to follow the changes that are made in schedule 3—that is why it describes the amendments that it makes as "minor and consequential". I hope that that is a satisfactory explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is possibly the most important debate that we shall have about the entire Bill. Schedules 3 and 4 devolve very considerable powers—which the Minister has under the Food Safety Act 1990—to the agency. Those powers are the default powers contained in clause 42(4), the powers of direction in clause 6(3) and the power of regulation in clause 6(4).<br><br>
This afternoon, the Minister has categorically put on the record that there is no intention that the agency should become a national enforcement agency. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0651">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 367</span>
powers that the Minister is handing over to the agency under the schedules are serious. He cannot have it both ways—either there is no intention that the agency should become a national enforcement agency, in which case he does not need to give those powers to it, or there is that intention. If that is the case, and that is the Minister's intention, why is he handing over the powers? We must know from the Minister what the real intention is. If there is no such intention, the Minister should retain those powers because they should be used only when things go wrong in an individual local authority.<br><br>
During debates on earlier clauses, we raised the question of what would happen if things started to go wrong and the Minister or the agency, under the new regulations, took powers over enforcement matters from the environmental health officer of a local authority. I would like to know whether the Minister's intention would be to return those powers to the local authority once the matter had been cleared up. There should be many stages before it became necessary for the Minister or the agency to take local authorities' and EHOs' powers. The agency should have powers of training and advice. Only when the situation is way down the road and still cannot be resolved should powers be removed from a local authority.<br><br>
I am not sure why it might be necessary for the agency to take over powers from the Minister; such situations are so serious that the Minister should keep the powers. I am especially concerned that, in schedule 4, what is possibly the most important aspect of the Bill—termed there "minor and consequential amendments"—is being handed over. That schedule will enable the Minister to give those powers to the agency.<br><br>
The Minister has some explaining to do. I would like him to tell us more clearly why it is necessary for those serious powers to be given to the agency. Does he expect the agency to use those powers only in extremis, after all the other steps that I have described have been taken? I would like him to confirm that, if the agency took those powers in respect of an individual local authority, he would expect the agency to return them to that authority once matters had been cleared up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Maclean <span class='memberconstituency'>(Penrith and The Border)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel a certain sympathy with the Minister. I recall times when one needed an urgent note on a technical legal matter only to discover that some of the Bill team's writing could be as good as a doctor's on a bad day.<br><br>
In some ways, the Minister has made a rod for his own back. He is right to note that, often nowadays, when one tries to consult an Act of Parliament, one cannot consult that Act alone but must look at 10 other subsequent Acts to discover what amendments have been made to it. However, the Minister is committing that offence.<br><br>
In future, if we wish to see the powers, duties and functions of the Food Standards Agency, we shall all go to the Food Standards Act which established it. When we look at that Act, where shall we find out about the powers and sections that have been
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 368</span>
incorporated from the 1990 Act? We shall not see them repeated for simplicity in the Food Standards Act; instead, we shall have to fish out obscure references from clause 18. That clause refers to the schedule. If we turn to the schedule, we shall find that the Minister will make orders to transfer chunks of the 1990 Act.<br><br>
I must say to both Ministers that it is such drafting that leads to some of the smell and suspicion from outside. I oversaw the passing of the powers of the 1990 Act, and I can defend our reasons for including them to take over the enforcement duties of local authorities and EHOs, even though we never used them. We were threatened by every EHO in the country. They told us that we dare not take over their powers because there was nothing wrong with them and that they would continue to do a perfect job or as good a job as they could in the circumstances. "If only the wicked Government gave us 10 times more money," they said. However, the powers to act existed.<br><br>
The sensible, easy, transparent move would surely be to go to the 1990 Act and, after this Bill has been passed, abolish or rescind it. One could then lift out sections 6, 13, 40, 41, 42 and 48 and build them into this Bill as sections 20 to 28, or whatever it may be. The Government have not yet explained why that has not been done. No doubt it is the draftsmen's view that they should not re-create, verbatim, in a new Bill clauses that are already contained in an Act of Parliament, when they could refer to them by some other obscure means. Perhaps that is a point of eternal principle for parliamentary draftsmen.<br><br>
2.30 pm<br><br>
While provisions that will allow the Minister in due course to bring the Meat Hygiene Service under the FSA and transfer the enforcement duties to the agency are being built into the Bill in this rather convoluted and apparently secretive way, of course we and others outside the House, including writers, will be suspicious that something is not quite transparent. Why are the Government going about it in this apparently secretive way? In fact, it is not secretive, because we are highlighting the issue and Ministers have been open about what they want to do. So why on earth proceed in that way? The Minister will be aiding and abetting Her Majesty's Stationery Office and helping it to con the public. When people go to buy the new Food Standards Act, they will find that they have to buy the old Tory Food Safety Act 1990 in order to read the provisions that the Minister is incorporating in this Bill.<br><br>
My hon. Friends have talked about the Meat Hygiene Service being incorporated into the Food Standards Agency and the agency taking over enforcement powers, but I do not want to go down that road. What I want to know is why the Government are doing it in this way, rather than writing those powers in and saying blatantly, "This was in the last Tory Government's Act, so you can't complain about it, right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border. You put it into your Act, and we are lifting it into ours." I am glad that the Minister is lifting bits of my legislation, but she does not need to be so secretive about it.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0652">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 369</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand that the Minister will want to give the new agency enforcement powers if he persists with the transfer of the Meat Hygiene Service to the Food Standards Agency; one must accept that as a consequence of what I consider to be the wrong decision. I am surprised, however, that we are using the same schedule to empower the agency to take away the enforcement activity of local authorities.<br><br>
There is a profound democratic issue at stake, which was discussed in the Special Select Committee. It strikes me as wrong for an independent agency to be able to override the actions of a locally elected tier of government. The agency should be free to publish recommendations to the Minister to take away the powers, but the actual order removing those powers must be signed by someone with a democratic mandate, rather than by an appointed agency. I hope that the Minister can give us some assurances on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give the same assurances: we are not transferring any powers to the agency. That meets the hon. Gentleman's point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may disagree with me, but that is the fact of the matter. The agency can be directed by Ministers to carry out the powers in the other Acts—powers that already exist. The title of schedule 3 is
<br><blockquote><p>"The Agency's functions under other Acts".</p></blockquote>
Thus, the powers are not going to the agency. This is the authority by which the Secretary of State for Health can say to the agency, "I want you to carry out the powers that I hold under the other Act." There is a legal authority for it. The powers are not going to the agency; in any event, no new powers are being created. Regulations will be made by Ministers and subject to debate and scrutiny in the House, and rightly so<br><br>
As I have said more than once, in this narrow respect concerning local authorities, this measure is the nuclear option. It would not be done in secret without any warning; it would be done as a result of the inability to meet enforcement standards, which have already been published and are in the public domain. There would have been inquiries and audits, so it would not happen overnight. The fact that the powers have not been exercised so far indicates that they are reserve powers; but I fully accept that, although the powers were included in the 1990 Act, there was no mechanism for monitoring the enforcement of local authorities. It is one of the missing areas in food legislation.<br><br>
On the issue of whether the powers would be returned, I sincerely hope that they would be, because the measure would be temporary. It would be similar to the way in which the previous Government sent in commissioners when there were problems in local government—usually across the river, but I shall not go down that route. Those measures were temporary. It would also be similar to some of the measures taken regarding schools, where commissioners were sent in to turn round a school, which then reverted back to how it was before. For example, an adjoining local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 370</span>
authority might carry out the function for a reasonable period while things were put right.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border is absolutely right, but only the Taxes Acts are consolidated. Every year, the Taxes Acts are updated and consolidated for the convenience of tax barristers and lawyers. One need only serve on a Finance Bill to find that out. There is a wonderful array of four or five volumes of Acts—it was four when I was last allowed to serve on a Finance Bill Committee, but, after the first time, there was a bit of a gap.<br><br>
There is a process by which legislation is consolidated in the normal course of events. Once the Bill becomes an Act, there might be a case—I cannot give any commitments about this—for consolidating Acts relating to food, or for the Food Standards Agency to publish a document that sets out where its powers lie in Acts of Parliament. In that way, commentators, the public and Members of Parliament would be able to see the powers set out without having to consult separate Acts of Parliament, and without Members of Parliament having to go to the Library to consult Acts which are constantly updated. If there is a change in an Act, one can see the handwritten notations in the margin—although that updating is probably done by computer these days. The legislation is kept bang up to date. There is a case for consolidation, as the right hon. Member said.<br><br>
I hate to have to say this, but things are done in that way—I did not study law making before I became a Member of Parliament—because that is how they have always been done. Someone puts forward a proposal for an amendment, and it grows like Topsy. It is a convenient approach, and it can be done quickly. We all know—especially given the events of the past week—how valuable is the parliamentary time for passing legislation. If a Government miss out any measure that requires primary legislation, they are in real trouble—unless it is a national emergency or a major crisis, in which case a Bill can be passed in a day or something can be added to what was missed out of the Queen's Speech. It is all a matter of the use of parliamentary time. Heavens above, I accept that this place still needs a lot of modernisation, but parliamentary time is a factor.<br><br>
In addition to the Library's version of updated Acts, one can look at the commercial publications that are available, such as Halsbury's Laws, which are published in loose-leaf form; everything is bang up to date, as it has to be for legal practitioners and enforcement authorities, so that there cannot be any confusion. It is not always possible to find out the current state of the law. I repeat the caveat that buying a copy of an Act of Parliament does not necessarily put the up-to-date state of the law at one's disposal. For the avoidance of any doubt, I also repeat that there is no intention or agenda to create a national enforcement authority. I cannot put that any more clearly—I have no doubt used different forms of words before, as I have said it umpteen times. People will have to read my words and look at the actions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is extremely helpful. The Minister could not have been clearer—there is no intention to have a national enforcement agency. If
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0653">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 371</span>
that is the case, why should powers be taken away from a democratically elected local authority and transferred to a next steps or one-remove agency, which is not as accountable as a Secretary of State. If such powers are to be exercised, surely they should be transferred to a democratically accountable Secretary of State or Minister of Agriculture, and not to a one-remove agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, the Bill contains no new powers. It transfers the operation of existing powers from one Government Department to another Government Department—the Food Standards Agency is a non-ministerial Government Department. The difference is that the Secretary of State for Health, in whom the powers reside, would ultimately exercise those powers, as he would direct the agency to exercise them. The chain of democratic accountability is not broken; that is my genuine submission. The Secretary of State will be fully accountable. He will not simply say, "I've got to do this, because the agency tells me I've got to." The Secretary of State for Health, or, in other cases, the devolved authorities, will make the decision.<br><br>
The powers referred to in schedule 3 already exist in legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Secretary of State will be effectively directing the agency to take those powers, why does the Secretary of State not direct the local authorities, without having to go through the agency?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Believe it or not, the Secretary of State has no authority to do that. That is why we are setting up the agency—its operation, which will set enforcement standards for local authorities and monitor them, will not be under day-to-day control. We do not want a Minister to stick his or her finger in the pie on a daily basis. The agency will be at arm's length from Ministers. It will operate as a Government Department headed by a separately appointed independent commission and the staff of the agency will be responsible to the commission and not the Minister. Although the agency's staff are civil servants, they will be responsible to the board of the agency. That is a much better way of proceeding than the old way. The Minister of Agriculture or the Secretary of State for Health takes the strategic decision to transfer, but the agency gets on with the work.<br><br>
I cannot understand the force of the hon. Gentleman's argument. Although all the clauses are important—otherwise they would not be there—I do not regard this clause as the nub of the Bill. The powers will not be given to the agency; they will reside with the Minister who can direct the agency to operate those powers. It would be wrong if the Minister, on his or her own, were able to exercise powers that were in conflict with the work of the agency.</span></p>
<p>2.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his usual courtesy in responding to my comments, including his response on amendments to the Food Safety Act 1990. If he had not raised the subject, I would have suggested that a consolidation measure might be appropriate, not least because we now have the added complication of devolution. Reference will be required to the Scotland Act 1998, the Government of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 372</span>
Wales Act 1998 and the Northern Ireland Act 1998 in all such legislation, as well as to previous food legislation, so a consolidation measure may be appropriate.<br><br>
The Minister also explained why the Government could not accept amendment No. 136. I confess that I had not picked up the issue of meat hygiene, and I shall reflect on that matter. I did not spend long moving amendment No. 136, for the simple reason that I did not understand it. The Minister kindly explained that I did not understand it because I did not table it. However, I am grateful to whoever tabled it because it enabled us to have this debate on the two amendments grouped with it.<br><br>
The Minister stated that there were no new powers in the Bill, and we accept that. However, there is much transfer of powers and accumulation of powers. That is important, and we are concerned about the agency's power to take on responsibilities that currently lie with Ministers, who are accountable to Parliament. That is the nub of our argument. However, it would be inappropriate to divide the Committee and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 143, in page 25, line 21, leave out 'enforcement' and insert 'food'.<br><br>
The amendment changes one of the paragraphs to which amendment No. 136 referred. Paragraph 2(a) currently states that the agency
<br><blockquote><p>"may be directed to discharge duties of enforcement authorities".</p></blockquote>
With the amendment, it will state:
<br><blockquote><p>"may be directed to discharge duties of food authorities".</p></blockquote>
This is a technical amendment to make the terminology in the Bill the same as in the Food Safety Act 1990.<br><br>
One reason why the Food Standards Agency did not become the "Food Standards Authority" or the "Food Authority" is that our attention was drawn to the legal definition of "authority". We are making the terminology absolutely correct and I owe the Committee an apology for wasting a couple of minutes of its time by having omitted that when the Bill was drafted.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 144, in page 27, line 25, leave out paragraph 10 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'10. In section 108(7) and section 111(7) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (grant of exemptions) after the words "Secretary of State" there shall be inserted the words ", or by the Secretary of State and the Food Standards Agency acting jointly,".</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>10A. For section 126 of that Act (exercise of certain functions relating to genetically modified organisms jointly by Secretary of State and Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) there shall be substituted the following section—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"Mode of exercise of certain functions</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>126.—(1) Any power of the Secretary of State to make regulations under this Part (other than the power conferred by section 113 above) is exercisable, where the regulations to be made relate to any matter with which the Minister is concerned, by the Secretary of State and the Minister acting jointly.

The amendment look substantial and onerous, but it merely replaces a provision in the Bill with a clearer explanation of what is intended We had hoped to make the amendment before the Bill was printed, but we were unable to do so because of the speed with which its Second Reading was obtained, following negotiations and discussion on the levy. The Bill was changed overnight immediately before it was printed. The main problem was to remove the levy and keep everything else correct, but we did not have time to do that.<br><br>
We have tried to make the schedule clearer. The amended paragraph is largely the same as earlier provisions that were widely supported during consultations. It is a drafting improvement that gives greater clarity to the circumstances in which the agency must be consulted about GM. It will also ensure that GM animal feeding stuffs are fully covered. In short, the changes constitute a minor strengthening of the obligations of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions to consult the agency, so that it cannot be by-passed. The Environmental Protection Act 1990 provides many powers to consult. We want to make it clear that MAFF, which has responsibilities in relation to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 374</span>
GM crops, must retain its consultative role. The amendment does not mark a radical change, but it makes it unambiguously clear that the Food Standards Agency will be the UK regulatory authority for GM issues.<br><br>
I do not intend to speak to schedule 3 stand part, but I should respond to the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border, who asked about the agency's status during our first or second sitting. I said then that we proposed to have three biotechnology commissions, dealing respectively with agriculture and the environment, human genetics and food. The latter commission will be the board of the Food Standards Agency. The announcements were made on 21 May, so that the public would know how the different advisory committees would deal with GM and, as the right hon. Gentleman said, who would be taking decisions and giving advice.<br><br>
I visited the Vote Office to check that it has copies of the pack, published on 21 May, which includes a document entitled, "The Advisory and Regulatory Framework for Biotechnology: Report from the Government's Review", the supply chain initiative on modified agricultural crops guidelines, and the paper produced by the chief medical officer and chief scientist on the health implications of GM food. Those documents contain diagrams that answer the right hon. Gentleman's question by showing who says what and who advises what in respect of biotechnology. I shall not explain them to the Committee because they are complicated, but they illustrate the relationships between the advisory committees and the commissions, and current and future overlaps. I waited until we debated Government amendment No. 144 before making that point, to avoid detaining the Committee on a schedule 3 stand part debate.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee, but I want to make one very brief point. As I have said, the schedule covers five and a half pages and amends seven major Acts of Parliament. It must be the most undersold schedule of any Act, and should have been given a different title. In years to come, the many people who will refer to the schedule will wonder why it is called "Minor and Consequential Amendments".</span></p>

Committee, Mr. Gale. We would also like to place on record our thanks to Mr. Hood. You have both guided us expeditiously through our debates and we are grateful for your guidance when we risked breaching the rules of procedure. You have shown good humour, and we have accomplished our task in the time set out for us.<br><br>
I would like to thank all my hon. Friends for the support that they have provided to the Committee, and also to place on record our thanks to the Opposition. Proceedings in Committee have been constructive, and I am pleased that the Bill will now move forward to Report. This legislation is enormously important to all Labour Members. Judging by the contributions received over the past three weeks, our aspirations are shared by Opposition Members, but I shall spare their blushes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to endorse what the right hon. Lady has said, and to thank you, Mr. Gale, and Mr. Hood for the way in which you have chaired the proceedings over the past three weeks. I have just remarked to my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman), "Is it only three weeks? It seems a lot longer."<br><br>
Those of us who have been in the House for a year or two—I think that the Minister of State may hold that record as far as members of this Committee are concerned—are used to Government Members on Committees adopting a Trappist nature and contributing very little, usually with the glare of the Whip ensuring that that remains the case. We had a brief flurry this morning, and the hon. Member for South Derbyshire has continued with that. However, this is the first time that I have encountered a Trappist Minister in Committee. I have never seen a Minister sit through the entire proceedings of a debate without saying a word, as the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland has done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Calum Macdonald)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was disappointed that a number of interesting amendments tabled by the Opposition were removed at our previous sitting. It is possible, however, that those issues may be raised again on Report, and I look forward to those exchanges, should they occur.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, and he tempts me to table even more amendments on Report. The reason that we withdrew them was that most hon. Members, with his honourable exception, felt that the ground had already been covered. They were related to devolution issues that had already been debated on the day that the hon. Gentleman was unable to be here, for reasons with which we are familiar.<br><br>
The other great feature of the Committee has been the straight speaking and honesty of the Minister of State, which comes as no surprise to those of us who have known him for some time. I have just been reading what was said in our sitting on Tuesday afternoon, and I have to say that it reads as well as it sounded. I hope that it will not get the Minister into the trouble that he anticipated. This afternoon we have heard accusations of lies by some observers, and of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 376</span>
conning the public, which is probably perfectly true but they do not particularly want to be told.<br><br>
We move to Report next week, when we shall reflect on what has been said in our debates on the many issues that were raised. Others may arise that were not debated. We look forward to that part of the Bill's progression through the House.<br><br>
Finally—I do not say this entirely tongue in cheek; I mean what I say—if the Prime Minister, in his wisdom, decides before next week to reshape his Government, I hope that the Minister of State and the Minister for Public Health do well, although we would miss them next Thursday, when we examine the Bill again. We look forward to that occasion, with or without their presence. As the Minister for Public Health said, the Government and the Opposition share a desire to see the Bill enacted.</span></p>
<p>3 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because I like brevity.<br><br>
I thank you, Mr. Gale—and, through you, Mr. Hood—for being so gentle with me and my learned Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. George). This was our first Standing Committee. It was a formative experience, which went on rather longer than I had anticipated, although it was enjoyable. I thank you for your tolerance.<br><br>
I also thank the official Opposition. I apologise for my remarks about the handwriting, which was quite readable and much better than mine. I thank the Ministers for being so open and frank and for giving us much to reflect on and to quote back at them in years to come.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should not normally speak at this stage, but, as the senior old Back Bencher, I shall do so. I have a plea that probably only a Back Bencher who is not under the proper control of the Front-Bench regime could make.<br><br>
I thank you, Mr. Gale, for your wonderful style. You and Mr. Hood concluded, probably wisely, that the best way to deal with many clauses was to avoid a stand part debate because Committee members' speeches had ranged far and wide. However, I suspect that that should not set a precedent for Standing Committees. Some of us might maintain that we ranged widely purely because the Minister of State led us astray by embarking on fascinating stories and that we were forced to follow him.<br><br>
The rub is this. Although we were discussing a serious subject, our proceedings were good humoured, and the Committee performed remarkably well. The Ministers are no doubt thankful to those who assisted them—those who had the onerous task of drafting the Bill, and those who assisted in Committee. However, they will be aware that these are sensitive times. A previous Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was criticised for what we might call the extravagant decoration of his office, but I shall not pursue that matter further. Given the bipartisan nature of our debates, it would be unfair to make accusations against the present Ministers.<br><br>
Next week, the Minister for Public Health may move on to other things, and, if the Minister of State
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0656">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 377</span>
becomes the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, I am sure that he will bear down heavily on excessive Government expenditure. He would not want to spend excessive amounts on a party to celebrate the fact that the Bill had successfully completed its various stages through the House. However, he might avoid accusations of partisanship and bias if he extended the invitations to that party to his Bill team, whom he will naturally want to thank, and to those others whom he may feel helped to make the Bill more successful. You, Mr. Gale, might be invited, and the Minister might conclude that other Members might add a certain je ne sais quoi to that function. At the moment, I am free on Thursday 22 July after 7 pm, although that might be rushing things somewhat, and the evening of Monday 26 July seems to be free.<br><br>
If the Minister of State does not move on to other things—or, perhaps more significantly, if he does—he and his staff might care to comb through <i>Hansard</i> during one of their few spare moments in the summer recess and gather together those wonderful expressions that he used and the stories that he told. We heard about the Greeks and the Spanish, he told us about the right hon. Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham) and the man with a cat and a cigarette sitting in a cafe in Paris, and he reminded us that, the night before the Bill was published, it had to be stood on its head. The Minister got away with such stories and wonderful
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 378</span>
sayings because of his style, and it would be churlish to use them against him. If they are brought together in a small booklet, which MAFF or his private office could circulate to those of us who had the pleasure of serving on the Committee, I promise not to use them against him. However, we might quote from it one day when we are asked by charities to give them funny stories about our time in Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot help feeling that the right hon. Gentleman's style as a Privy Councillor belongs to a slightly earlier, and wilier, generation.<br><br>
I thank Committee members for their concluding remarks, which I shall ensure are conveyed to Mr. Hood. I also thank them for the humour and courtesy with which our deliberations have been conducted. It is a sadness to me, on occasions such as these, that the cameras are not present to show the public how Parliament works—they are usually aware only of the bear garden that they see all too often on television. Mr. Hood and I are grateful to you all.<br><br>
On behalf of Committee members, I thank the officers and staff of the House for their patience and hard work throughout our proceedings. Without their help, our proceedings would not have been possible.</span></p>
