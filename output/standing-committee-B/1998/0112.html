	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish all Members as happy, as prosperous and as peaceful a new year as parliamentary duties ordinarily permit. In spite of the inclement weather outside, if hon. Members wish to remove their jackets, they may.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the sittings motion appears at the top of the amendment paper, I do not propose to call it for debate now. I suggest that we see how business goes this morning and if it becomes apparent that we need to move it I shall invite the Minister to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first amendment on the order paper, amendment No. 8, has already been debated with amendment No. 7. Technically, it can be voted on but it cannot now be debated. I take it from the silence that the Committee is happy to proceed to amendment No. 9.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 3</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>INFORMATION CONTAINED IN CERTIFICATES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Evan Harris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, West and Abingdon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 3, line 45, after 'hospitals', insert 'or at home'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 12, in clause 7, page 5, line 33, after 'hospital' insert 'or at home'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to reciprocate your best wishes for the new year, Mr. Gale, and to say how pleased I am to be serving on this Committee under your chairmanship for the first time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 9 draws attention to a potentially distorting anomaly in the phrasing of the Bill. I invite the Minister to explain how he believes safeguards can be included in the Bill to ensure that the anomaly can be avoided because it would have significant effects, especially on the practice of discharge from acute hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the current phrasing, the charging of insurance companies for third parties injured in traumatic accidents applies only to national health service care delivered in an NHS hospital setting at a certain amount per day, which is fixed by regulation. I have two concerns about that, one of which is directly addressed and the other indirectly addressed by the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, if the fixed charge per day is not very close to the amount that it actually costs the hospital to look after such people, there could be an incentive to retain people in hospital or discharge them early for financial reasons that do not apply when charging arrangements are not made. In other words, if the cost
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
per day, suggested to be about £600, is higher than the actual cost to the hospital, there will be a financial incentive not to push people out of a hospital bed because to retain people will become a net income generator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, there will be other pressures on beds, and one hopes that those will be paramount. Indeed, at the moment, we can see that they are. However, there is a danger that there will be less incentive to remove people, where appropriate, from hospital and into NHS care at home. If the amount is too little, hospitals may be seen to be making a financial loss, and there will be a perverse financial incentive to try to move people out of hospital to free up beds. However, I do not wish to address that problem now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where NHS care is provided in a home package, which may cost the health service as much, more or less than care in hospital, there is a danger that people will not be discharged to such a package if the income generating situation that I described applies. If the cost that is claimable through hospital care is seen as a net income generator, discharge to home under NHS care will be regarded as an expense that may not be provided for in the contracts. I will return to my concerns about the perversion and distortion of the contracting arrangements when we debate a later amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be logical and, given the overall dangers of the bureaucracy inherent in the Bill, not unreasonable for the charges to apply to NHS care at home. I wish to stress, as we have previously, that we do not like the principle of this sort of charging but if it has to be done, there is a strong argument that it should be done in a way that does not distort decisions about discharge. Will the Minister reassure me and my hon. Friends that that has been considered by his Department and that mechanisms will be in place to ensure that those factors do not come into play? If, sadly, they do, will there be a way of monitoring what is taking place and will his Department be able to act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Duncan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rutland and Melton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join hon. Members in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Gale. I hope that you had an enjoyable Christmas and new year break.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to repeat what the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) said, but I agree that perverse incentives are likely to emerge from how the Bill affects treatment in hospital and at home. Can the Minister reassure the Committee that an analysis has been conducted on how people will respond to the money that will flow from this provision? It is an enduring fact of life that when it comes to economics people will, by and large, behave rationally. If a trust gains a financial advantage by treating someone, it is inevitable that that will influence some of the decisions on whether a person should be treated in hospital or at home. Managers of trusts will look not only at absolute costs but at marginal costs when they work out whether it is to their benefit to have someone treated in hospital for longer than is necessary. What study has been made on the effects of the difference between the charging structures in hospital and at home?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0713">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. John Hutton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Gale. I, like you, hope that we can deal with the rest of the Bill in today's sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon and the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) are trying to be helpful in raising these issues, but let me reassure them that we do not believe that the Bill will have the perverse incentive effect that they imagine. It is unfair and improper to think that clinicians will allow the Bill to interfere with their clinical judgment on how to treat a patient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three specific reasons why the amendment is unnecessary and why the Committee should reject it if it is pressed to a vote. First, hospitals would no longer be required to ask whether a patient intends to claim compensation as a result of a road traffic accident: hospitals would not routinely know which patients might be affected by the Bill's provisions. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon overlooked that important point. Secondly, even if hospitals had that information, they would have to rely completely on the patient to provide it in possibly traumatic circumstances of admittance to an accident and emergency department. It may not be appropriate to rely on such information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third reason which—given what the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton said about the role of money—is possibly the most important, is that the money recouped under the Bill's provisions is unlikely to be received by an NHS trust for at least two years after the accident. That is the normal length of time for an accident claim to be settled. Therefore, it would be unusual for a hospital trust, on the possibility of financial recovery two years in the future, to interfere with the clinical judgments that nurses and doctors must make immediately after a road traffic accident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those three reasons, I do not believe that anything in the Bill would give rise to any perverse incentive to treat a patient inappropriately, which was the main concern of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. We do not believe that clinicians will treat road traffic accident victims inappropriately after their trauma. The Bill is simple and the least bureaucratic-option available in collecting important resources for the NHS. The amendment would add to the complexity of the system, provide no tangible benefit to the NHS and risk reconnecting front-line NHS staff to income collection. We do not think that that is right and do not want it to happen. For those reasons, I hope that he is reassured about what is in the Bill and not press his amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that reply, because it clarifies how he foresees there not being a perverse incentive. I accept his reassurance on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a final point on something that the Minister did not address in his reply, perhaps because I did not deal with it as fully as I should have. It is a philosophical point about the reason for the Government's decision to restrict the charging mechanism to charges collected in hospital. It was
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
eloquently put by the hon. Member for South Swindon (Ms Drown) on Second Reading. I invite her to reassure me that she is now satisfied. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Care in the home has been emphasised as an alternative to hospital treatment—an alternative that many patients prefer. The Bill allows the NHS to recover from insurance companies the cost of hospital treatment given to people injured in road traffic accidents. In 1930, when the Road Traffic Act was introduced, I suspect that no thought was given to alternatives to treating people in hospital and that the emphasis on acute hospital care rather than community care was even stronger than it is now.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Given that motorists are insured for the cost of NHS treatment resulting from road accidents, should not the Bill reflect the modern reality of the NHS and allow the cost of treating road accident injuries to be charged whether treatment takes place in hospital or in the home?"</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for South Swindon then addressed the point that I made earlier, on which the Minister has reassured me and, I suspect, her. She added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I urge the Government to examine the possibility of amending the Bill to enable the recovery of the cost of treatment given either in hospital or at home. That would be wholly appropriate given the shifts in the culture surrounding hospital and non-hospital care."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 8 December 1998; Vol. 322, c. 192–3.]</p></blockquote>
I do not believe that it is appropriate, on philosophical grounds, to extend charging any further—my concern was with the perverse incentive—but I should be interested to know from her or the Minister why the Government decided to restrict the application of the Bill to hospital care, when in a modern setting care is often given at home as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is again misconceiving the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps. I think that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon envisages a situation where a road traffic accident victim is treated exclusively at home and does not make an appearance in hospital. That would be extraordinary. I am sure that a road traffic accident victim would first be assessed and treated in an accident and emergency department and would then, one hopes, be discharged. He may then reappear as an out-patient or receive some nursing care at home. Certainly the research conducted by the Transport Research Laboratory showed that in road traffic accident cases, nursing care at home—was minimal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon also misunderstood the nature of the flat-rate fee for road traffic accident victims who have not been admitted to hospital for treatment. It will cover treatment for patients who are not admitted to hospital and will cover any physiotherapy or other nursing or specialist services delivered to road traffic accident victims at home. Our scheme will not need a separate tariff regime for the cost of nursing or care at home because such care will be provided in only a minimal number of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon misunderstood the situation involving a person who is injured in a road traffic accident, who is looked after in an accident and emergency department and who is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0714">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
discharged. Some care and treatment may be given at home, but such costs will be recovered as part of the flat-rate fee that the hospital will charge for that patient. There is no question of that treatment's not being part of our recovery arrangements. With respect, the hon. Gentleman misrepresented the way that a road traffic accident victim is likely to be treated in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are aware of the hon. Gentleman's concerns, and we have examined the matter very carefully. Our scheme will deal with the question that he posed about who will recover the costs for care that is delivered at home—such costs will be part of the flat-rate fee. Nothing has been missed out or left out. The hon. Gentleman's proposal would make the scheme unnecessarily complicated and there would be no real benefit to the national health service. For the reasons that I have given, I hope that he is reassured and that he will not press the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stress that the concerns that I mentioned were not originally raised by me: I offered them on behalf of the hon. Member for South Swindon—although she may not see things my way— and I was seeking to clarify the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a misunderstanding about the number of people who have in-patient treatment and treatment at home but no out-patient interval. Such a situation is reasonable, especially in relation to that minority of people who are so badly injured and in trauma that they need relatively long-term nursing care from the national health service. Such care can still be provided—just about—in this country, and the hon. Lady did not make an unreasonable point. However, if she is happy with the Minister's answer, I am, too; but if she is not happy with it, it is for her to seek to catch your eye, Mr. Gale. I shall not press the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Julia Drown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Swindon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A happy new year to you, Mr. Gale, and to all other Committee members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding of the scheme—my hon. Friend the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—is that when people go to hospital for treatment they will be charged either for out-patient attendance or, if they receive in-patient treatment, for the number of days' treatment that they receive. My concern is about someone who needs out-patient treatment but who is brought back to hospital rather than treated at home, in order to involve the out-patient charge. My understanding of the Bill—and this was clarified earlier—is that if one is treated in hospital, one will be charged either for out-patient treatment or for the number of days spent as an in-patient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon discussed the case of a person who receives some inpatient treatment and who has some out-patient follow-ups at home. In view of the different rates for out-patient and in-patient treatment, I am satisfied that if a patient is in hospital for several days, a certain sum will be recovered and that it would be better to average out the figure on that basis rather than to
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
involve more complex charges that include a certain number of in-patient treatments plus an out-patient charge. If I have not understood the situation correctly, I hope that my hon. Friend will correct me. That is a simple and satisfactory way to run the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon. She is absolutely right— she has understood the Bill's basic structure, which is to differentiate between the patient who is admitted to a ward in a hospital and the patient who is not so admitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon raised the case of a non-admitted patient, which will involve a flat-rate fee of £354, and that will be it. It does not matter how many times a patient is admitted to an out-patient clinic—the rate charged to the insurer will not be affected. There is a difference between that case and the patient who is admitted to hospital, which will involve the charge of a daily rate. That is the scheme's basic structure, and the hon. Gentleman's concerns about it are mistaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not make any difference whether the patient is called back for subsequent out-patient appointments—that will not affect the rate charged to the insurers. My hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon made that point, but the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon did not fully appreciate it in his opening remarks. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment to a vote— he said that he would not—and that he is satisfied by my reassurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 4, line 10, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(7) The Secretary of State shall lay before Parliament every three years a report of a review of the amount or amounts to be specified in regulations under subsection (2) above and of the basis of his cost calculations.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>New clause 3—	<i>Annual report by Secretary of State</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>'The Secretary of State shall lay before Parliament an annual report specifying the charges received by health authorities under this Act and the costs incurred by (a) each health authority and (b) his Department in collecting those charges.'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>New clause 4—	<i>Duty of insurers to submit annual report to Parliament</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>'It shall be the duty of any person liable to pay a charge to the Secretary of State under section 1 to submit by 30 June in each year following the passing of this Act a report to the Chairman of the House of Commons Health Select Committee, stating in respect of the preceding calendar year—

	<li>the total of any such payments made to the Secretary of State, and</li>
	<li>the effect, if any, of making those payments on the cost to that person's customers of purchasing motor insurance.'.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a simple plea for greater recognition of the fact that Parliament matters, that it should be told about the structure of costs proposed at any stage by the Minister, and that it should be able on

	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
occasion—every three years, according to my amendment—to examine the fees levied by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, the wording of the Bill seems to set a scale that is utterly arbitrary. No sufficient argument is put to justify its structure, and Parliament will be unable sufficiently to scrutinise the setting of the fees when they are changed from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government make a lot of noise about their hatred of the internal market. One of the internal market's advantages is that it gives people in the national health service a clearer idea of cost. If the Minister intends to remove the basis on which cost can be calculated, he will also remove the ability to set his scale charges logically. Parliament wants a clear explanation of why charges are set at a particular level, how they are built up, how they are calculated and how they compare with the actual cost of patient treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Liberal Democrat amendments address issues similar to those with which amendment No. 10 deals, parliamentary scrutiny of the setting of fees, and of the working of the Bill, needs to be further enhanced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Liberal Democrats support amendment No. 10 for the reasons given by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton. Grouped with that amendment is new clause 3, which would require the Secretary of State to
	<br><blockquote><p>"lay before Parliament an annual report specifying the charges received by health authorities—"</p></blockquote>
or hospitals—
	<br><blockquote><p>"under this Act and the costs incurred by"</p></blockquote>
health authorities or hospitals and the Department. The new clause would enable the investigation of the scheme's cost—an important matter of which Parliament should be aware in future years.

New Clause 4 would require those paying the charges—the insurers of injured and third parties—to report the measure's impact to, in this case, the Chairman of the House of Commons Select Committee on Health. On Second Reading, the measure's impact, through car insurance, on the payment of treatment for which the NHS has usually hitherto paid, notwithstanding the prior existence of relevant provisions, was discussed at length. The worry was expressed that the Bill will, in effect, tax people indirectly through their car insurance. It is vital that Parliament and, indeed, consumers are made aware of the effect that the measure will have on car insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 4 would require insurers to notify the Select Committee of the total payments made, which would not be difficult to do, and to report the effect of those payments on car insurance. If we are to assess the success of the Bill, such a measure is critical. That is true even by the Government's own terms. They said on Second Reading that, in their view, the Bill's impact on car insurance would not be excessive. That is a debatable point. They should put their conviction to the test by accepting new clause 4 in particular, which
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
would enable them to show that the effects that people fear have not come to pass. I therefore hope that the Government will accept the amendment and new clauses 3 and 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I must disappoint the hon. Gentleman: I shall urge the Committee to reject the amendment and new clauses 3 and 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with the amendment. Throughout the passage of the Bill we have tried to be open about the planned charges and about the calculations that underpin the new tariff regime. The amendment makes the assumption that that openness will not continue. That is not the case. The operation of the scheme will be reviewed every six months and we shall keep the amounts charged under active consideration. Parliament will have the opportunity to debate any new regulations and to vote on them if it feels that that is appropriate. The amendment therefore does not offer any benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister clarify the terms of reference of the six-monthly review?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the review will have formal terms of reference—it will not be a tribunal of inquiry. However, Department officials will keep the operation of the scheme under review. We have made it clear that we want the scheme to operate as simply and as effectively as possible; we want the least possible bureaucracy and to generate the maximum income for the NHS. We believe that those clear objectives are reflected fully and fairly in the Bill. The purpose of the review is to assess the effectiveness of the arrangements and to ensure that they are working in the way that we intend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that point, I understood the Minister to say that the aim of the measures is to maximise the income of the NHS. That is what the amendment seeks to clarify because a daily tariff that is much higher than the realistic cost could be set—that would achieve the Minister's declared aim of maximising income, but it would not be fair. Does not the amendment question the pretext on which the tariff for the daily rate is set? Saying that it is to be kept under review by departmental officials is not the same as having an open review to which Opposition Members have easy access.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the hon. Gentleman is reading more into the Bill and into my remarks than is justified. We have continually made it clear that we want the NHS to recover the income to which it is entitled—something which is transparently not happening. We want to ensure that the NHS recovers the cost of treatment, and that is what we think the Bill will achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is being uncharacteristically mischievous and rather naive about the effect of the amendment. For the reasons that I have given, we do not believe that the amendment will add anything of benefit in terms of parliamentary scrutiny or of the provisions of the Bill. I do not want to keep referring
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0716">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
to the debates we had before Christmas, but we had an extensive debate about the basis on which the tariff regime has been calculated. We have been open about that and have also alerted members of the Committee to the Transport Research Laboratory's report No. 272. That empirical and robust research forms the solid basis for the fundamentals of the tariff regime. I reject the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that the tariff regime figures have been plucked out of thin air. They have not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures are based on solid and robust research. We have been open with members of the Committee about that research and have not held anything back. For those clear reasons, the amendment deserves to be rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On new clause 3—to which other amendments are connected—the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon began by saying that he was alert to the dangers of bureaucracy. I am therefore sad that he supports the amendment because it would add to the bureaucracy of the system and produce no substantial benefit. The wording of new clause 3 suggests that the health authorities would receive the recoverable income. That is a strange change to propose because the purpose of the scheme is to get the income generated to the front line of the NHS, where patients are treated. The hon. Gentleman is also mistaken in assuming that the information will not be generally available. All trusts are required to file annual accounts, and the information on the amounts received by each trust will be available to the public, as happens now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the regulatory appraisal covering the Bill we have published an estimate of the departmental cost of implementing the scheme. We have set aside £1.4 million for the first year of the scheme, which includes a non-recurrent contribution towards an information technology system. If some of the wilder estimates of potential income are set aside and the scheme recoups around £100 million a year, it will be an economical method of collection. I emphasise that the current main costs of the compensation recovery unit are around 2 per cent, of the benefit that it recovers, so the charge recovery system is very efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be no benefit in institutionalising the data that are currently available to assist hon. Members in understanding whether the tariff and charging regimes are effective. That information is available and I cannot support new clause 3. If the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon has other specific concerns about the tariff regime, he can table questions to Ministers, which we shall answer as openly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 4 is also rather strange. It would place a burden on insurers to report to the Select Committee on Health and to provide information that might be
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
commercially sensitive. I cannot support the new clause, and I note that the Association of British Insurers is not enamoured of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment and new clause 3 and 4 would invite more bureaucracy into the system, which we do not want. We want bureaucracy to be kept to a minimum, and I advise my hon. Friends to reject the amendment if it is pressed to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to the Minister's comments on new clause 3, it may be preferable if I explain later why it refers to health authorities and not hospitals— there is a good reason for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the requirement for data gathering in new clause 3 would be bureaucratic, but that applies to any exercise designed to measure bureaucracy. The logical extension of his comment that bureaucracy should not be measured is that no bureaucratic process would ever be measured. It is not unreasonable to investigate whether there is excessive bureaucracy in a system and a small investment may be necessary to do so, but a down-the-line saving will flow from showing that something may be over-bureaucratic. A parliamentary question is not without some charge, and suggesting that as an alternative way of obtaining information will not be without cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misunderstands my comments. The new clause is unnecessary because the information that he wants will be available from either trusts' annual accounts or elsewhere. The new clause would add a bureaucratic layer to the scheme and provide no information that will not be available elsewhere. It would be a complete waste of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall accept that only if the Department does not respond to a parliamentary question a year or two after enactment of the Bill by saying that the information is not collected centrally. Ploughing through the annual reports of hundreds of trusts is not an effective way of finding information that the Minister says will be freely available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister admitted that there will be a two-year delay before costs are collectable by the NHS, so annual reports will not show clearly and explicitly how much is being collected. Extracting that information will involve a wider exercise, best conducted through the Department under the provisions of the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Dismore 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a straightforward point. The new system will be administered by the compensation recovery unit. Before my election to the Commons, I regularly sought information about the CRU's performance from the CRU direct. That information was readily made available to me, as a personal injury lawyer. Since my election to Parliament, I have regularly tabled parliamentary questions about the CRU's performance and have received perfectly satisfactory, detailed answers, as 	<i>Hansard</i> will show.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that such information can be made available; it can be requested from the CRU. However, a cost is attached
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0717">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
to that. The purpose of new clause 3 is specifically to ensure that it is the Department's responsibility to check the details. My concern is that, in his response to new clause 3 and especially to new clause 4 and amendment No. 10, the Minister has put a lot of faith in future Governments not wanting to extract a higher toll than might otherwise be taken. Indeed, I remind Labour Members that the Bill was a surprise to many people, given that it was not explicitly covered in their manifesto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the Association of British Insurers does not support new clause 4 is not a good reason for the Minister to cite in his defence, given that the ABI opposes the whole concept of the Bill—perhaps for different reasons than my hon. Friends and I. In this era of openness, especially given the need to be open about taxation—whether indirect or direct—such figures should be made available to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 4 would not require the disclosure of commercially sensitive information. In representations made to hon. Members of all parties before Second Reading, the ABI was happy to state in advance how much it thought premiums would increase under the Bill. Therefore, in retrospect, the ABI can be even more certain of that. If that information was not commercially sensitive on Second Reading, I cannot believe that the ABI would consider it to be commercially sensitive now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Drown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say why I do not support the amendment? As someone who worked for many years in the health service and is still in touch with many people there, I know that there is a feeling that, if anything, far too much information is collated centrally, and serious questions are asked about what use is made of such information. It would be fine if it were Parliament's absolute priority to ask for a new report on this matter every few years, but, given the huge number of matters that we debate in Parliament, the importance of this is not so great as to justify an annual report and bureaucratic costs associated with that. I would much prefer health service staff to spend their time looking after patients than collating such reports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister was outlining the rationality of the proposed tariff system, I tried to seek clarification, but he would not give way. I wanted an assurance from the Minister that the rationality of the tariff system would bind his successors. Is he confident that his successors will use such a system? If there were no report to Parliament, could Ministers dream up a new system in the future that they believed to be rational but which would be far removed from the Minister's original intentions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not for a moment doubt the Minister's wish to be open and frank about the way in which he sets tariffs, but verbal commitments of that sort from one Minister have a habit of becoming somewhat less of a commitment as they are passed on to successor Ministers. Parliament should be able to scrutinise such matters in detail, largely because, as the
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
Minister says, the purpose of the Bill is to recoup the actual costs of treatment. However, we are seeing in the NHS the removal of the means by which those costs can properly be calculated. Therefore, we have to fall back on Parliament's ability to ask appropriate questions about how the tariffs will be set. For that principal reason, I should like to press amendment No. 10 to a Divison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 4, line 10, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(7) Any certificate issued shall also be supplied to the traffic casualty or, if the traffic casualty has died, his personal representative.'.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure openness in the system. That is something about which my hon. Friends and I feel strongly, and we think that the amendment should be acceptable to the Government. The amendment states that, when a certificate is issued, it
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall also be supplied to the traffic casualty or… his personal representative",</p></blockquote>
so that the person in whose name payments are being made for NHS care is entirely aware that that is happening and is aware of the cost. That is not an unusual requirement in terms of payments by insurance companies. If a car is damaged in a third-party accident, the owner claims on the other person's insurance. When the insurance company pays for the car to be repaired, it is usual for the car's owner to receive a copy of the bill to show how much the damage cost to repair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main concerns about the Bill is that it is effectively introducing indirect taxation through the back door in a covert way. That is an exception to the general principle of the NHS that in-patient and outpatient treatment should be free at the point of delivery—it is paid for through taxation. Any departure from that must be made explicit so that people are aware that a cost is involved which is met through a mechanism other than direct taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When prescription charges are levied, people are aware of the cost and it is widely noted. It is not unreasonable for the Liberal Democrats and any other support that there might be in Committee to press the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0718">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
Minister in the name of openness to allow people in whose name payments are being made to be told about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept the criticisms that have been made by the Association of British Insurers. Indeed, I would be surprised if the businesses that were paying charges to third parties would be especially interested in sending out notices to show that such costs were being paid. However, if they feel so strongly about the effects that the Bill might have on premiums, they might be in favour of a wider education programme. I certainly do not believe that it is unreasonable for people to be sent a copy of the bill showing how much has been paid on their behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, when someone has died, relatives are liable to grieve, but as the Minister said, many payments will be made two years down the line, and there are many reminders of mortality to grieving relatives other than notification of issues relating to the accident. Therefore, I do not accept that criticism, but the Minister might have others. I hope that he will not seek to imply that wanting the Government and the system to be open with people about charges is somehow cruel and unfair to grieving relatives or patients, as that is not the kind of society we want—we want openness. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The official Opposition intend to support the amendment, for the reasons that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon has outlined, but also because it would introduce a simple administrative requirement that amounts to no more than sending a carbon copy of a piece of paper to the victim or to the victim's family or lawyers. However, it would also have the considerable advantage of being an effective back-up in terms of verifying the possibly significant figures which, two years later, may pass across someone's desk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The victim or those close to the victim will recall the circumstances in which the victim was treated and will have a clear idea of whether the fees levied match that treatment. Given that the Bill gives scope for administrative messes to occur, that verification procedure constitutes obvious common sense, could be provided at no great cost and would represent no great bureaucratic burden. Our simple and sensible amendment would enhance the workings of the recovery of compensation which is the principal purpose of the Bill, and I therefore hope that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I am afraid I shall have to disappoint both the hon. Gentlemen—particularly the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, who moved the amendment. I do not doubt that his intentions are honest and genuine. As he sees it, the amendment would improve the transparency of the tariff recovery scheme and be of benefit, in a way that he did not specify, to accident victims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not agree. The amendment would not provide any benefit or ensure better information about or accuracy of the costs recovered. The fundamental
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
point that the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members should keep in mind is that the NHS charges will be recovered from the compensating driver's insurer, not from the victim. The amount of compensation paid to the victim will not be affected by the amount of NHS charges recovered from the insurer. That is the major difference between the NHS scheme and the benefit recovery scheme—which is perhaps the basis on which the hon. Gentleman rests his amendment—whereby the victim receives a copy of the benefit recovery certificate. Under the latter scheme, the compensation paid to the benefit recipient is affected by the benefit clawback. However, under our scheme, giving victims the certificate is of no benefit to them; all that would do is add to their worry and concern by creating the erroneous belief that they will have to pay the charges themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would also be of no benefit to the system, because it would increase bureaucracy and costs through extra paper and mail-outs. It is wrong in principle to expect the accident victim somehow to act as policeman in ensuring the accuracy of the NHS recovery charge system, which is what the hon. Members for Oxford, West and Abingdon and for Rutland and Melton envisage. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton said that the amendment would ensure that the right amount was recovered, but we do not believe that it is the victim's responsibility to ensure that. For all those reasons, I cannot recommend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his reply, as far as it went. I want to make two points in response. First, while I shall not give a view on the comments of the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton, I did not say that it was the role of the road traffic accident victim to be a policeman or that the function of the amendment was to ensure that the right amount was paid. I am saying that there should be a presumption of openness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has introduced a new point about whether receiving such a notice would confuse the road traffic accident victim or his representative into believing that a charge may be payable. That reveals the Government's fear that people will believe that the Bill is asking them to pay directly. Indeed, in the debate on an earlier amendment today, the hon. Member for South Swindon referred to the charges that patients will pay. While that may have been only a slip of the tongue, there is a feeling outside the House that such measures are a direct form of charging. Members of the Committee, and, I hope, Members of the House by the end of the passage of the Bill, will realise that that is not the case, but as there is still an indirect charge through motor insurance premiums, which the Government do not deny, there is an argument about the scale of the charges. The Government do not deny that there will be an increase in the premium. People are entitled to be told that directly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks a presumption of openness in legislation. There must be overwhelming arguments why people should not be told what is happening in such situations. The cost of a second-class stamp on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0719">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
top of a bill of at least £600 if an in-patient stay is involved, or a smaller, though significant, amount for an out-patient, is not a sufficient argument against a presumption of openness. So strongly do we believe that there should be a presumption of openness in legislation and in society that I intend to press the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Whenever such legislation is promulgated, attention must be given to whether it is appropriate and whether there are adequate safeguards. The issue of who should be entitled to information about patients is continually changing. On such a sensitive matter, in particular with regard to the degree of a patient's disability and the effects of an accident on a patient's health, it seems
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
reasonable to ask the Data Protection Commissioner for his opinion on whether the Bill's provisions, and regulations that arise from it, are acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the amendment would allow the Data Protection Commissioner to give his opinion on the Bill, but as I understand it, the amendment requires the commissioner to approve the clause. That is a totally different concept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the Minister. To approve or disapprove, the Data Protection Commissioner would have to give an opinion. I do not seek to confuse the issue by stating that the clause should not come into force until it has been specifically approved by the commissioner because of concerns about the release of patient information to third parties. This is a probing amendment which seeks to discover what assurances the Minister can give that he is satisfied that provisions for privacy and data protection on sensitive information about patient care will not be recklessly and unnecessarily made available to third parties. I want to be reassured that the provision will allow patients to withhold information or at least to be told what is being released to third parties who have not been involved in their medical treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Gentleman may be referring to the requirement for subordinate legislation to be the subject of consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner. I assure him that that is the case. The Data Protection Registrar was fully consulted on clauses 11 and 12. We took his comments on board and we expect to reflect them in subsequent regulations. I think that he is confused about data protection legislation: he is confusing primary legislation with secondary legislation. We are not prepared to accept the novel constitutional principle that primary legislation should be run past the commissioner before it becomes law. Draft regulations arising from clauses 11 and 12 will be made available to the commissioner for further advice. The amendment is misconceived and misplaced. We are fully seized of the need to ensure that there is proper provision for data protection. The amendment is unnecessary and probably unwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 are consequential on amendment No. 16. They all address the same issue, which we have already touched on briefly. I want to explain to the Minister why I have tabled these amendments because it may not be clear from our previous discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill proposes that payments made by insurers through the compensation recovery unit should go directly to the hospital. The Minister described that as going to the front line of the NHS. On the surface, that seems a reasonable approach, if one accepts that the Bill is sensible. We have already said that we do not. Our concern is about the effect that that approach will have on the contracting process. It is necessary to explain what I mean by that and to dissociate myself from support of the ramifications of the current system of contracting and the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, there is a split between the purchaser and the provider, and the health authority will buy trauma and orthopaedic services from providers such as hospitals. Those are the services that are currently being given to third-party accident victims and will be covered by the Bill. Indeed, the Government's planned reforms will not change that division between purchaser and provider, so there will be a form of contracting for those services. Even if the term "purchaser" is changed to "commissioner" and the term "contract" is changed to "service agreement", there will still be a transfer of funds from a commissioner to a hospital or provider for that service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Commissioners dealing with such transactions are not naive—one would not expect commissioners or purchasers to be naive. They will recognise that hospitals and providers with whom they contract receive an income stream under the provisions of the Bill—they may assume that they already receive an income stream, although at a lower level, because the
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
Government's intention is to increase the amount that can be raised through measures that are already on the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the fact that there is a two-year lag—a point that the Minister made when he dealt with this issue earlier—it is not beyond the ability of purchasers, or commissioners as they will be called, to recognise that they will receive an income stream, to de-fund those providers on that basis and to reduce the level of the contract to take into account the new income stream for the treatment of such cases. In fact, it would arguably be wrong and poor financial management to continue to pay, through a contract of arrangements, for trauma care when a separate stream of finance is received by the provider unit to pay for that. That would be paying for the same treatment twice under the NHS, which would be difficult for the health authority to justify under the audit to which it is, quite rightly, subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger of the proposal is that it will complicate the contracting arrangement because commissioners will try to second-guess the amount of such income in prospective contracts and reduce the amount that they pay for trauma cases. Indeed, they will be forced to do so from the fear of paying twice, and they will have to do it initially on limited data. The data will initially be limited because income will not be allocated in all trauma cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be allocated to third parties in an insurance claim, but not to the first party in an accident. As was made clear in earlier discussions, the income stream will come months—if not years—later. In the year in which it is anticipated, commissioners or purchasers will seek to avoid paying twice, and they will have to do so by guesswork.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best way to get round that problem is to allow the income stream to go directly to the purchaser. If that were done, it could be measured much more easily and would not interfere with the existing—sometimes complex—contracting arrangements between commissioners and hospital providers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not have escaped the attention of the Committee that complex, market-type arrangements are involved. Judging by the likely results of NHS reforms, we will be in that position for some years to come. If the Minister rejects the amendment, he will have to explain the benefits of a system that sends funding directly to the provider through a separate stream that is outside the current contracting arrangements over a system that sends it to the main purchaser of the service. The latter proposal would provide and care for a patient in a patient-specific way, but it would not distort the current contracting process, which is already complex and delicately balanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second concern about the current arrangements would be partly, but not wholly, dealt with if the amendment were accepted. If the proposed mechanism works, as I believe that it will, a whole section of work that hospitals provide—it mainly involves trauma and orthopaedic cases but some others as well—will be paid for by a stream of income that is separate from the usual contracting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0721">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
arrangements with purchasers. Those purchasers may include health authorities or a general practitioner commissioner, which currently means a fundholding GP but which will involve the proposed primary care groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger is that trusts that are minded to do something about a proposed deficit will concertedly seek to maximise their income for that section of treatment. Our concerns about perverse incentives would then increase. The Minister sought to reassure us about the motives of people who manage the care of patients in hospitals, but if purchasing authorities withdraw a stream of funding because they expect a certain amount to come from another source, the hospital or provider would be bound—if it wants to avoid ending the year in deficit for that contract—to attempt to realise the funding that is predicted to come from the separate stream.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having sections of treatment that are not subject to the normal NHS purchasing procedures through taxation is a dangerous development. We would effectively witness the de-NHS-isation—if I may use such a noun and if the 	<i>Hansard</i> staff can handle it—of a whole section of treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Drown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that if the amendment were accepted, and money was sent to health authorities, the second-guessing that he discussed would happen in reverse? A representative from a trauma and orthopaedic department might say, "Health authorities get money from the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act. They therefore have more money than we do, and they should pass it on to us so that we can provide services." The bickering between health authorities and trusts would continue. However, sending money to a health authority or trust would have a similar result. Does he share my view, or does he see any advantages in sending the money to a health authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite the hon. Lady's interesting intervention, there will be bickering under any such system. The Government should consider ending that regime, because that would end the bickering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I appreciate the hon. Lady's point, I am not sure that she is right. She and I remember our negotiations about funding new posts through a separate stream of income, which the previous Government proposed to reduce junior doctors' hours. For a long time, that income stream was given directly to hospitals in the health authority areas in which she and I worked. The system did not work. Oxfordshire health authority, for which I worked, and the Radcliffe Infirmary Trust, for which she worked, instead brought that income stream to purchaser funding across the whole region. The purchaser—the health authority—and, I believe, the trust chief executive, deemed that system better than the distorting of contracts through separate income streams.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
When one buys work from a provider, it makes greater sense empirically for all the funds to go through a single contract. The hon. Member for South Swindon implied that the relationship is a mirror image, a reciprocal one in which the funding stream comes through the purchaser, not the provider. Streams are brought together so that contracting and purchasing decisions can be made holistically, rather than by second guessing other income streams over which the purchaser has no control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Drown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Gentleman to recognise that no trust has a single income stream. Income is derived from many different sources, from car parking charges to health authority commissions. Unless we amalgamate all trusts into one health authority—a measure that might bring advantages, but which we are not debating today—it is simply not possible to reduce all income to a single stream.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Lady's point, but there is a marked difference between the provision of services through forms of income such as league of friends' contributions and car parking charges, and through commissioning arrangements. Such forms of income are generally small. One hopes that they are small, because their extension would further undermine the provision of NHS services through general taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that in most places income streams are generated by more than one purchaser. In general, that is because a proportion of patients treated by the provider usually come from a separate purchaser area. In trust A, 10 per cent., say, of treated trauma orthopaedics may originate from a health authority outside the area in which the trust is situated. Such a statistic can be reproduced and measured easily. A wholly separate income stream not involving contracts would be much more difficult to quantify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Swindon will know— perhaps to her cost—the health authorities gang up when making contracting arrangements. Certainly, in a purchaser-provider contract, different purchasers are in cahoots. That will not be the case with this income stream, because it is consequential on whether the casualty was injured by someone else's car, in an accident in which his or her vehicle was at fault, or through some other means. Her points therefore strengthen the validity of my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister feel that the Bill's wording is sufficient and appropriate? Although we may not like it, is not the amendment a constructive one that deserves further attention because it would enable existing arrangements to run more smoothly, without the distorting effects of direct payment to the provider? I urge the Minister to give careful thought to my comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman invited me to consider whether the Bill's wording is adequate. He will not be surprised to discover that, for reasons that I shall explain, I believe that it is, and that the amendment is unnecessary. The hon. Gentleman is trying to identify a problem that might arise when the arrangements become fully operational, but he has not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0722">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
offered a viable solution to that possible problem and he has not explained why transferring resources to health authorities would solve the problem that he believes might arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The money that the scheme generates will go to trusts to use as they see fit. The hon. Gentleman envisages that if income is generated, a commissioning body might reduce the allocation for trauma or accident and emergency services. It is for trusts to discuss with commissioners how the resources will be used for the benefit of all patients. The hon. Gentleman is mistaken in assuming that the money could be applied only to accident and emergency cover. That is not so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some trusts already receive significant income from the existing arrangements—up to £300,000 a year in some cases. We are not aware of any reported difficulties for the trusts or in their relations with the commissioning bodies. Some hospitals may have a significant income stream under the new arrangements and some commissioners may try to net that income when discussing contracts with the trusts, but neither the trusts nor the commissioning bodies can bank on income from that source because it will depend on a number of variable factors, including the number of accidents, their severity, the success rate of compensation claims and so on. It is very difficult to be precise about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not aware that the existing arrangements cause the sort of problems to which the hon. Gentleman referred and we do not anticipate that the new arrangements will cause the problems at which he hinted. The amendment is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The income will belong, as it has always done, to the hospitals providing the treatment. It has not and will not affect the treatment offered to patients. In respect of the income stream that is likely to be generated, trusts are perfectly capable of managing discussions with commissioners on how it might affect service agreements. The hon. Gentleman's anxieties are unnecessary given the history of the scheme and the arrangements that we want to put in place. He is making a mountain out of a molehill and I cannot recommend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Minister and I am pleased that he at least recognises that there is an issue to be discussed. He stated that the existing arrangements provide income and that it is lower than that envisaged under the Bill. I am surprised that he believes that that will not be an issue for the contracting process. I pay tribute to the acuity of the purchasers that I know in Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Northamptonshire because they would not hesitate in trying to discount any presumed income stream from another source and would be very tough in their negotiations. It would be surprising if purchasers did not take that into account, although health authorities elsewhere may not be as strapped for cash as those in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
A separate question arises as to whether the process will be distorted. I believe that it will be distorted and that sending money to the purchaser would diminish that. I am not wholly reassured by the Minister's comments and I shall take advice from the NHS Confederation and purchasers that I know on how they intend to handle the issue. I shall not press the amendment to a Division, but will consider in more detail the factors that may apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Again we want to ensure that this Government, and any future Government who may not have such an innocent outlook on these matters as the Minister, justify to Parliament what they are doing in relation to these proposals.

I want to try to persuade him yet again that there is no conspiracy and that the procedures that we are using to exercise these regulation-making powers are perfectly consistent with those in other legislation, especially legislation applying to the national health service. The hon. Gentleman is invoking an additional and inappropriate layer of procedure that is not found in any other piece of legislation in the United Kingdom, apart from one provision in the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. However, as he will be aware, that Act applies a specific procedure to amending primary legislation, which is not the subject of the Bill. Therefore, his approach is mistaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is rerunning the argument that we will somehow conceal information from the House about the way in which we arrive at decisions on the regulations, on the tariff regime and on other aspects of the proposals. His concern is totally misplaced. We have been as open and as clear with members of the Committee as we can be. That will remain the position. The regulation-making powers that we can exercise under the Bill will be subject to full, normal and proper parliamentary accountability: hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments relate to section 145 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, which sets out requirements for compulsory motor insurance. Compulsory motor vehicle insurance in the UK can be sold only by companies authorised for the purpose. From time to time, an insurer may wish to withdraw from the motor insurance market. Section 145 of the 1988 Act ensures that if insurers do withdraw and cease to be authorised, they continue to have to meet the obligations that arose when they were authorised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment makes it clear that if an obligation has already arisen for an insurer to pay NHS charges, and if that insurer loses or relinquishes authorisation to transact compulsory motor vehicle insurance, he or she continues to be liable for the outstanding NHS costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 1 would simply abolish the emergency treatment fee for traffic casualties. It strikes me that the Bill leaves a fag-end of a charge that will be expensive and awkward to administer when it has already been abolished for collection by NHS hospitals. I imagine that, by and large, it will apply to general practitioners who attend the scene of an accident and who are then able to levy a charge of £21.30.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course GPs attend accidents. In my rural constituency of Rutland and Melton, there is a very good GP service, which, with modern technology, can alert GPs to attend the scene of an accident more quickly than an ambulance, but it seems that charging
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0724">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
£21.30 under the scheme, rather than making some sort of payment to GPs through the NHS, is a measly and unnecessary system. It might help the Committee if the Minister would say how many GPs are likely to be affected by the measure in any year, how often they are likely to be affected and whether an emergency treatment fee of £21.30, or any other figure that is raised in due course, will really make a sufficiently significant difference to their income that it should remain for the practical purposes of GP treatment of casualties. If it will not make a significant difference, the Minister should accept the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am wrong, and the charge does matter to many GPs—if it forms an important part of their income, is easily and readily collected and there is a great swathe of opinion against the new clause—I will concede. However, I cannot see it at the moment. It strikes me that to leave such a fag-end is a bureaucratic and unnecessary nonsense, and that the Bill would be much tidier if the fee were removed altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Liberal Democrats support the new clause. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton eloquently painted two scenarios. The first was that this is not an important charge, especially in terms of quantity, in which case no one will be unhappy to see its demise. We support that view. He also said that this might be a useful form of income and that the Minister might not wish to lose the current provision, in which case the Conservatives would be happy, if convinced by the data, to retain it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats, however, would be unhappy to see the fee retained because we oppose the principle of direct charging of patients for health care, whether it be in a casualty department or as a result of an ambulance driver asking for a fare or a general practitioner at the roadside scene of an accident asking the patient involved for a flat-rate fee. That is a regressive form of payment and, because what we are talking about is still NHS treatment, albeit through a private or independent contractor, it is a form of regressive taxation for the NHS. We hope that the new clause is acceptable for all possible scenarios.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the new clause, but before I examine its substance I want to explain the background to the emergency treatment fee. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton knows that we are removing the right of NHS hospitals to collect the emergency treatment fee. It is right that we do that because it is a nightmare to collect. Front-line NHS staff are involved in recovering charges, which is not appropriate; the fee is set at a level that calls into question its worth; and we sympathise with the plight of some drivers who are faced with a bill for treatment. That is why we are removing the right of NHS trusts to collect the fee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Representations from various interested bodies have pointed out that general practitioners want to continue to have the right to collect the fee. GPs are independent contractors, as the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton knows. If they consider collection to be a worthwhile effort and to have a worthwhile
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
effect on the person from whom the fee is claimed, we are not minded to remove the right, which has been in place since 1934. We have some sympathy with his arguments, but the independent contractors—the GPs—have told us that they want to continue to have the right to collect the fee. We are not persuaded that it would be appropriate to remove that right in those circumstances. I cannot, therefore, endorse the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton asked specific questions about the number of GPs involved and how much of the emergency treatment fee they collect. Sadly, we do not have that information because it is not collected centrally—that has a familiar ring to it. GPs are independent contractors; they are not obliged to inform the Department of Health about the collection of the emergency treatment fee. The Government have listened to GPs' representations. In light of those representations and the discussions that we have had with GPs, we have decided to continue their right to collect the emergency treatment fee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister also said that collection involves front-line NHS staff. To some extent, GPs are front-line NHS staff. They are also in charge of patient care and will be involved in the bureaucracy of collecting the fee. As a former Minister of Health said, collection of the fee adds to the burden and misery of people at the scene of an accident. As there is no information on how many GPs levy the fee, the Minister should agree to suspend judgment and return to the matter on Report. In the meantime, he will have had the opportunity to collect sufficient information to give him a better idea of whether the fee is worth keeping. He is suggesting that he does not know and that he has merely received representations from GPs saying that they would like to be able to continue to levy the fee. It might be better if they were to be paid by the NHS for attending an accident instead of charging in what seems to be an unsatisfactory way. We do not know what the income stream is or how often GPs attend accidents. The Department of Health should have that information because GPs make an important contribution to the care of patients involved in road traffic accidents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unhappy with the detail that the Minister gave to the Committee.

	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
that that information would be available before Report. That is a fact of life. The hon. Gentleman is expecting a deluge of information between now and Report, but that will not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have considered the matter carefully and have decided to leave GPs with the right to collect an emergency treatment fee if they so choose. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the undertaking that he wants—to return with a different view on Report. We have considered the matter and do not intend to change our mind about the right of GPs to collect an emergency treatment fee when they consider it appropriate—it is for them to decide that. The position will remain as at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me clarify the position. Clause 18 retains the emergency payment provision. If the Committee votes for clause 18 stand part, new clause 1 will automatically fall.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to discuss the penultimate amendment to the Bill—new clause 5— which I hope is welcome to the Minister. New clause 6 would have a similar effect to new clause 5, although it has a slightly different emphasis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We raise this matter again because the Bill's confirmation of existing rights under old legislation marks a significant departure for the NHS, which is traditionally financed through taxation, is free at the point of delivery, and involves neither general charges, especially for in-patient treatment, nor indirect charges, such as insurance premiums for motor vehicle accidents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman recognise that under the Bill's provisions NHS treatment will continue to be free at the point of use?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I accept that under the Bill's provisions NHS treatment will be free at the point of use but, for the treatment under discussion, it will not be both free at the point of use and funded by general taxation. Most people identify both those approaches with the NHS, especially for in-patient treatment. However, I accept that such charges can already be introduced under current legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We debated this matter fully on Second Reading, so I shall not labour my point, but the Government had an opportunity to remove all such charges. If they had done so, we should now be debating a Bill to remove all those charges and to restore perhaps all treatments— certainly in-patient and out-patient treatment—to the ambit of those treatments that are funded through general taxation. The Government decided to follow another path, which is their right, just as it is ours to oppose them as strongly as we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause asks the Government—not this Government but a future one—to pause after five years, which is a reasonable length of time, and to ask, "In the light of experience, is this the direction in which we want the services to be supplied under the NHS?" That will involve current procedures and others that may occur to the Minister and to other Ministers who want to develop alternatives to taxation as ways of funding the NHS. On many occasions we have said that such discussions about the future funding of the NHS should go beyond the narrow political arena; they should be heard in a standing conference attended by users, political parties, professionals and taxpayers. We could then have a proper discussion about the right way to fund the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would allow the Government to accept our broader proposal, although we shall have to discuss that elsewhere. They should accept the need for a broad review of the way to proceed as there are rising demands on the NHS and the Government, and recent previous Governments, appear to have a limited desire to raise NHS funding in the traditional manner through general taxation. The new clause will allow the Government to say, "Let's have a review and assess the Act's operation." I hope that we shall hear the population's views in the standing conference that I described, and that the Government will not go down
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0726">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
their proposed path. Once the Bill is enacted, new clause 6 would allow the Government to let the legislation lapse by omission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will respond broadly, although I predict that he will not look favourably on either of the new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I am not going to disappoint the hon. Gentleman on that score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman widened the scope of his concerns when he moved the new clause, although we also heard the familiar recitation of his fundamental objection to the Bill's principles. That is fine, but we have had that argument, and he lost it. He repeated his allegation that the Government are not properly funding the NHS. I flatly refute that. The NHS is being properly funded—indeed, it is receiving record funding, thanks to the Government's commitments. It is disingenuous of him to suggest otherwise. I must point out one fact to him: in the NHS, 30 new hospitals are under construction or have been approved. That is testimony to the Government's commitment to modernise and renew the NHS. I do not wish to undermine the spirit of harmony that has prevailed, but we will not listen to lectures from Liberal Democrats on NHS funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already made it clear in the regulatory appraisal that accompanied the Bill, which I am sure the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon has read thoroughly, that the scheme will be reviewed within six months, not five years. The result of that review will be published when they are available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By incorporating an obligation to review the Act after five years, new clause 5 implies that the Government are doing something unprincipled, outrageous or unprecedented in the history of United Kingdom legislation. In fact, we are marrying an old principle—the entitlement of hospitals to recover
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
treatment costs in such cases—with the established system of benefit recovery. That is hardly a leap in the dark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has been discussed fully and properly, and we have been over this course several times before. In the light of our commitment to review the scheme within six months, and to publish the results, new clause 5 is inappropriate and unnecessary. It would create more bureaucracy, and we therefore reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he would not listen to lectures from Liberal Democrats on NHS funding. I shall not risk being called to order by responding to that remark. Nevertheless, by the Secretary of State's own admission, the NHS is in a crisis caused not by the viral problems of influenza or by severe weather, but by funding and bed shortages. The Minister's remark will therefore be greeted with surprise. One does not have to be critical of the Government—although I am—to say that the NHS is chronically underfunded. That is why we want a wider debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the proposed six-monthly review, but a fundamental review of NHS funding should be undertaken that takes into account legislation such as this. However, given the Minister's mood so close to lunch-time, I am unlikely to make progress with him, nor indeed with the Committee. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
