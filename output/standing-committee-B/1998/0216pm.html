<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were discussing the apparent gap between the disappearance of CCT and the implementation of the best value. Tomorrow's 	<i>Hansard</i> will show that the Liberal Democrats wish to expand that gap and that the Government wish to tighten it. We must examine possible dates: I support my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) in his desire to ensure that the gap is filled. It does not seem desirable to dismantle compulsory competitive tendering before 2002.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The timetable in the Bill implies that implementation will commence in January 2002. That assumes that Royal Assent will be received in late 1999, and that clauses 1 to 19 will come into effect 12 months later. However, the Government must still produce guidance and orders, which must pass through the appropriate procedures. Thirty-nine pilot best value studies will not be concluded until late 1999, at best. They must be evaluated and, as a result, the Government must produce guidance on consultations, reviews and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New PIs are currently out for consultation and pilot results will be available by, at best, mid-2000. That assumes that the new PIs can be brought in by 1999–2000, or by 1 April this year. The first full year for the new PIs will therefore be 2000–2001, and results from those will be available between the middle and end of 2001.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>388</span>
Standards and targets have not been set in many areas in which consultation is required. In general, no reviews will be concluded until the end of 2000–2001. When such reviews are concluded, they will not have reference to the new guidance, indicators and so on. Reviews must be based on real comparisons. For the new PIs, however, that will not be possible until 2002 and 2003.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems unrealistic to expect local authorities to publish their local performance plans before the end of the financial year 2001. Even then, they would only be able to publish skeleton plans. To add to the complications, inter-borough comparisons will not be available until 2001–2002.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members of the Committee are always helpful, and are being especially helpful today. My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex said that we do not want a black hole between the old and new systems to damage the progress and implementation of the Bill. It would be appropriate to apply some parts of the Bill to local authorities at a later date, especially under the next Conservative Administration. I am therefore keen that the gap should be filled. I await the Minister's explanation of how she will shorten the consultation to produce the desired result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always enjoy the helpful points made by the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir P. Beresford). I will address those that he has just made later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to hon. Members for raising the question of the balance between ending CCT and introducing best value. It is important that we get that right so that authorities are clear about what is expected of them and about the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A repeal date of 2 January was carefully identified to take account of existing CCT timetables for the initial implementation of professional white collar services in England. I consider it important to ensure that authorities receive a clear message that they must comply with the existing legislation and not anticipate the introduction of best value by abandoning tender exercises at a late stage in the process. That in itself would involve them in a loss of money which it would be difficult for the Government to justify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to comply with the implementation dates for white collar services up to 1 January 2000, authorities will have commenced the tendering process well before Royal Assent might be expected. It usually takes around 12 months to prepare for and complete a tendering exercise and commence the contract. This principle also applies to existing CCT contracts which become due for re-letting in the same period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, balanced against that prime consideration I am anxious to provide as much time as possible for authorities to make sensible preparations for best value without the distraction of CCT. Amendment No. 219, by contrast, would ensure that the provisions of the CCT legislation remain in force until the best value regime begins. The date we specified in the Bill, 2 January, immediately follows the last planned implementation date for white collar professional services, which is 1 January. No other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0946">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>389</span>
new, white collar services will become due for implementation between this date and the date when the relevant provision is brought into force by an order under subsection 20(2). That will probably be on 1 April 2000, but we shall come to that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities will be able to make good use of the period between 2 January and the commencement date of this legislation to prepare for early best value action by, for example, making preparations for the production of local performance plans and the conduct of their reviews. We intend to use our guidance powers under subsection 18(2) to assist authorities in managing the transition from CCT to best value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales, CCT has been generally suspended since April 1994 following local government reorganisation. The moratorium for work subject to the Local Government Act 1988 extends beyond 2 January 2000. The moratorium for work subject to the Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980 currently expires before 2 January and is scheduled to be extended to 2 January to align it with the date of abolition. In my view, the 2 January date offers a realistic balance to ensure that both of these requirements will be met. I therefore ask the hon. Member for North Essex to withdraw that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be sensible or appropriate to remove subsection 18(2)(a), as amendment No. 15 proposes, as that would prevent the Secretary of State from issuing guidance to authorities in respect of the transitional period from the revocation of CCT to the coming into force of the relevant provisions of best value. As a transitional arrangment, I intend that there should be scope for authorities to incorporate evidence of compliance with certain CCT requirements in the final year of that regime in their early best value reviews of performance in order to provide a basis of comparison in the summaries of performance which they will be required to produce under best value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, in contrast to CCT the test of competitiveness under best value will take a variety of forms and a coherent strategy on competition and procurement issues will be very important. Many authorities will need, and welcome, guidance, especially guidance that disseminates information about best practice such as that which emerges from the best value pilot exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that guidance on those requirements be provided to authorities to send a clear signal on future obligations. Only in this way can the Secretary of State ensure the ordered transition from CCT to best value. Therefore, I again request that amendment No. 15 not be pressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 227 would bring forward the date for the repeal of CCT legislation from 2 January 2000 to 30 September this year, and amendment No.230 accordingly seeks to alter the period in respect of which the Secretary of State can issue transitional guidance. Members of the Committee will be aware that in both the best value Green Paper and the local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>390</span>
government White Papers we sent robust messages about the importance of competition within best value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore considered carefully the date for the abolition of CCT to reinforce the importance of competition while simultaneously giving local authorities an appropriate room for manoeuvre to allow them to prepare for the application of the duty of best value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those documents were, by their nature, consultations. Will the Minister say what responses local authorities gave on the date for the abolition of CCT and how they felt it would impact on their preparations for best value?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were a variety of response but I do not have them to hand. Local government was not the only organisation that responded, and, when drafting the Bill, we took account of consultations. There was pressure from local government to, on the one hand, make the position absolutely clear, and, on the other, be flexible. We felt that we needed to be clear about the dates and to give guidance—not instructions—on the transition period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was explaining the importance of the transition period. I understand that hon. Members may wish to lengthen it to give authorities more time to prepare. But in doing so they may not have thought through the position of authorities that were reorganised on 1 April 1998. We realise that these authorities need some breathing space before becoming subject to the CCT regime, which is why they enjoy an 18-month moratorium before having to do so. However, the moratorium ends on 1 October 1999 and they must have exposed their blue-collar manual services to CCT by then. I have just said that, typically, it takes about one year for authorities to let CCT contracts, so many of those that were organised in April 1998 will already be in the early stages of tendering to meet that obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to create uncertainty for, or send mixed messages to, those authorities. I have already said that CCT has both its problems and its benefits. An organisation that has been subject to recent reorganisation will be helped, through the discipline of CCT, to prepare for best value in terms of specifying services and identifying local markets for delivering them. I want them to capitalise on those disciplines in the same manner as any other type of authority. I do not want the thoughtless selection of a repeal date to tempt some of those authorities to abandon tendering exercises which they may already have begun and which may already have involved them in expense; indeed, doing so would put them at risk of criticism from their auditors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That means that there will have been a Labour Government for almost three years, during which time CCT will have continued, despite, I imagine, almost every Labour Member having for years been on record as condemning the worst parts of CCT and its impact on local government services. I am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0947">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>391</span>
surprised that the hon. Lady does not take this opportunity to move the date forward, especially for the unitary authorities that she has just mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have always said, and we continue to say, that a proper transition period is necessary to move from one system to the other. We made it clear before and during the general election in the Green Paper on best value and in the White Paper on local government that there would be a managed transition from one system to the other, and that there would not be a period of limbo when nothing happened. The hon. Lady may not have heard that, but I assure her that her local authority has, because I have repeated it at event after event. There is little contention about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, although reorganisation has not necessarily had an effect, some of the arguments are equally applicable to those authorities which have white-collar services which are due to be exposed to CCT for the first time by 1 January 2000. In those cases too, therefore, I consider 2 January 2000 to be the right date for the repeal of CCT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that we must strike the right balance and, given the extreme view advanced by the Conservative party and the Liberal Democrats, we are once again taking the third way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With reference to amendment No. 230, the period in which the Secretary of State should be able to issue transitional guidance should match the period between the repeal of CCT and the date of introduction of the duty of best value. I remind Opposition Members of the changes that we made to CCT early in the Parliament. They may not have noticed that we said that authorities would be exempted from CCT if they went into voluntary tendering or voluntary partnership in order to deliver services effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We made other slight adjustments to the CCT regime. It is worth repeating that our concern was always with the straitjacket of the compulsion of the old regime. We are not afraid of competition and neither is local government; it is frequently the way to improve the approach to services and their delivery. The opportunity voluntarily to enter tendering exercises has already allowed exemptions from compulsion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of what I have said about the changes we have already made to CCT and about a managed transition from one to the other, the amendments do not quite hit the right note, or strike the right balance. I hope, having heard the explanation, that Opposition Members will not press the amendments to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin	<div class='memberconstituency'> (North Essex)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An immortal phrase from the hon. Lady's lips encapsulated what she was trying to say. She talked of the "thoughtless selection of a repeal date". She was, I think, trying to explain that it is a matter of fine judgment how long the hiatus between the end of competitive tendering and the Bill's coming into force should be. In her response to the Liberal Democrat amendment I rather thought
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>392</span>
that the hon. Lady talked herself out of having a hiatus. I agree that the best approach to best value is that CCT should continue. What happens if a major service comes up for review?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that it does not. Perhaps she can clarify that later. If a major contract came up for review, what would happen during the hiatus? What would we expect a local authority to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another potential problem is that the in-house organisation or the external firm might default, and a new tender or a contract might have to be sought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. That thought had also occurred to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sorry about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is all right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What regime would apply in the interim? Does the Secretary of State have recourse to special powers, or would the Secretary of State effect the best value provisions early for that local authority to exercise some control over the process? Would the local authority decide how to proceed? In that period, local authorities will be freer than they have ever been, and freer than they will ever be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a little unclear about whether the Minister meant that there would be no transition period, as the hon. Member for North Essex believes, or whether she was considering another date between 30 September and 2 January. She did not give a specific reason for 2 January being a magical date. Her argument did not convince me and I am not sure whether it convinced all the hon. Members who sit behind her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Alan Whitehead	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southampton, Test)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady seems to have convinced those who sit behind her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not responsible for those who sit behind me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to press amendment No. 229 because it is a simple and practical proposal to lift a burden from local authorities. Where does the Minister envisage that local government, especially unitary authorities, which will have to implement the provisions for three months, will find the staff to run CCT contracts and go through the tendering process, and to prepare best value performance plans? My local government contracts would like the date to be moved forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious that my comments were not as clear as they might have been to Opposition Members, and that some confusion has arisen. We chose 2 January because 1 January is the final date for awarding contracts for white collar services under CCT. That is what I meant when I responded from a sedentary position to the hon. Member for North Essex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0948">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>393</span>
The CCT process includes dates by which specific functions have to be performed, and 1 January is a key date for white collar services. Authorities will already have started preparing the contracts that will be let on 1 January. The Bill does not yet have Royal Assent. Therefore, I cannot bring forward its implementation to the date that the hon. Lady prefers. Even Royal Assent is not guaranteed by that date. I hope that the Bill will be passed by then, but, as the hon. Lady knows, that depends on the House and the other place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure that we do not incur needless work for local authorities, and that the money that local authorities already spend is not wasted. Therefore, 1 January was carefully selected. Contracts should have been let by then. For the next three months after that, we shall issue guidance. We intend to introduce best value from 1 April 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both Front-Bench spokesmen missed the subtle way—though subtle is not the right way to describe CCT—in which a mechanical process is being set up with specific dates. In accommodating those dates, authorities will have to start preparing for contracts a year in advance. That is why that date was chosen. I hope that that meets the concerns raised by both Opposition parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to respond more directly to the questions about timing raised by the hon. Member for Mole Valley. The first local performance plans must be produced by March 2000. We debated that earlier in the Bill and it will be made a statutory requirement. We will consult on new performance indicators this summer in order to introduce them by April 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we debated performance indicators, I said that the Audit Commission had, following consultation, introduced some new indicators for this year, which it thought might be helpful when best value is introduced next year. However, I made it clear that the Government were seeking to identify, through consultation later in the summer, some core national indicators. We hope to introduce them, through orders, by April 2000.

We also intend to use transitional guidance on the move from CCT to best value in order to assist authorities to carry forward relevant data from 1999–2000. Authorities need to recognise their achievements on efficiency so far and feed them into their performance plans for best value. We thus seek to ensure the provision of guidance for a carefully constructed transition period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Essex pressed me on what will happen between 2 January and 1 April. Authorities will have to consider their actions in the light of guidance on best value, which will be in place and available before 2 January. They will need to decide what to do about any contracts that finish during that period. I understand that there will not be an excessive number of such contracts, but another reason for issuing guidance is to help authorities in those circumstances to know how best to proceed.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is simply a drafting improvement to the Bill and does not represent any change in policy. Subsection (1), which defines the meaning of references to the Audit Commission, does so only for part I of the Bill because as currently drafted the Bill refers to it only in part I. However, in earlier debates we signalled that the Government will in due course bring forward an amendment to the Bill to allow Parliament to pay moneys to the commission for expenses it incurs in discharging its best value. That amendment will be to clause 26 which is in part III of the Bill. As references to the Audit Commission will therefore come in more than one part of the Bill subsection (1) needs to be amended. Amendment No. 67 achieves that.

The White Paper proposed that the cost of inspection would be recovered by a mixture of fees and grants. New clause 5 would enable the commission to prescribe a scale of fees to cover the costs of the inspections carried out under clause 10 which provides the Audit Commission with a power to carry out inspections as to the degree to which authorities comply with the requirements of the legal framework.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Hayes	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Holland and The Deepings)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Under-Secretary give us a notional view of the size of that? Obviously it will be different for different types of authorities but I guess that there is a notional model and it would be useful to have it explained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to come to that. The scale will be prescribed after consultation with the Secretary of State and representatives of other best value authorities. Fees for inspections could vary, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, where costs were higher or lower than the standard fee scale. The new clause will ensure that the commission's work is properly funded and that it can carry out a comprehensive programme of inspection of best value authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are in discussion with the Audit Commission about the cost of inspection. Figures cannot be finalised until the proposals for the inspection framework are finalised. That will be achieved after consultation with a range of interested parties, including the Audit Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I advise the Committee that we have not yet finalised the relevant proportions of either the fee or the grant that will meet the total costs of inspection, and which will be treated by the Government as a new burden on authorities. When the proportion has been determined, an appropriate figure will be given in the local authoritiy revenue support grant to cover the cost of inspection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Amendment No. 67 is a drafting amendment to cover later parts of the Bill. New clause 5 provides for financial and fiscal measures that will enable the Audit Commission to carry out its functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Curry	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Skipton and Ripon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary said that fees would come from two sources—first, there would be the element paid by the local authority, and, secondly, there would be a grant. The Under-Secretary has not specified how that breaks down. He also said that the local authority element would be a new burden, so the authority would be compensated, presumably, through the SSA mechanism in some way. However, that does not necessarily lead to the precise amount of fee to be charged. Is the Under-Secretary saying that the whole fee will be met by a combination of revenue support
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>396</span>
grant and direct grant to the Audit Commission, or will an element of the fee fall upon the local authority's own resources, over and above any additional element received?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, it will be a mixture. The compensation figure has yet to be agreed, as consultations and negotiations are currently taking place. There will be recompense by grant, as the right hon. Gentleman has said, but there will be a fee for the cost of the Audit Commission's inspection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that no element of the fee will not be covered, either by the grant that will go to the local authority, as a new burden, or the grant, that will go directly to the Audit Commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, new clause 5 will enable the Audit Commission to prescribe a scale of fees for the inspection, part of which will be recovered from the revenue support grant. Negotiations and consultations with local authority organisations and the Audit Commission are under way. I cannot say what the proportions might be while the consultation process is continuing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to find out the proportion between the grant that goes directly to the Audit Commission and the grant that goes via the local authority. I want an assurance that there will be no net cost to the local authority irrespective of the route, or which elements are in each route.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The scale of fees will be prescribed when the consultation exercise has been completed and when the Secretary of State has agreed them, after a series of consultations with best value authorities. As I have said, there will be a mixture of fees and grants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We understand that a mixture of grant and fee is involved, but we want an assurance that the burden will not fall on local authorities. I asked the Under-Secretary for a notional view. I accept that negotiations are under way, but surely he must have a notional idea whether a burden will be placed on local authorities and, if so, what it will be. Local authorities will be very anxious to hear of the prevarication that we heard in response to an earlier intervention. They will be very frightened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making, but I can give no assurance now; I can say only that, as consultations proceed, compensation under the revenue support grant is under negotiation and that it will be balanced by an element of fee payment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the Under-Secretary that the reaction of local government will be that they should not be burdened. However, given that the Government are likely to go ahead with their proposals, I repeat an important question: will new clause 5(4) apply to new clause 5(3)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meal</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I can say is that, under that subsection, there will be a mixture—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>397</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me translate the question for the Under-Secretary. When the Audit Commission charges a larger fee because the work is greater or a smaller fee because it is less great, will that larger or smaller fee be subject to a scale? That is what my hon. Friend is asking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. Gentleman. As he rightly says, under new clause 5(3), if an inspection means a departure from the standard scale, the commission will be allowed to make further arrangements, and it can do that when it estimates what the fees will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I advise the Committee that we will take a decision on new clause 5 later in our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every member of the Committee, especially those who have been involved in local government, will be aware of the concern that local government will be burdened under the proposals. That burden is unasked for; it is not required and local government does not want it. Given pressure from the Treasury, we expect a burden to be placed on local authorities, although new clause 5 is helpful and goes in the right direction on other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary will recall something that was said on Second Reading. Perhaps he will not, given his lack of response to some of the questions that he has been asked. The Under-Secretary is not listening; he is writing. Perhaps the Committee should be adjourned while he gathers his notes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much concern—Westminster being the classic example—that a huge burden will be laid on local authorities and council tax payers. To date, we have had no assurance that a ceiling will be put on such charges; nor even an assurance that one will be put on a proportion of the total bill. I have been part of the Audit Commission and I can imagine an increased charge under new clause 5(3) being nodded through without too much difficulty if it is item 15 on the agenda and late at night. Having said that, I wll not be invited to join the Audit Commission again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If new clause 5(4) were to apply, we would be going in the right direction. In essence, local authorities, Conservative Members, and perhaps Liberal Democrats, if they cared to think about it, want local government to be protected. Perhaps those costs could be totally covered, as was suggested by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry). In other words, they could be paid through a combination of grants and standard spending assessment and, therefore, through the revenue support grant; or a ceiling should at least buffer those charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have three questions for the Under-Secretary. First, under the clause, the Audit Commission will prescribe scales of fees, which will be agreed in consultation with the Secretary of State and representatives of best value authorities. However, when the Audit Commission does so, it must have in mind a proportion of the cost to be recovered. Both
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>398</span>
Conservative and Labour Governments have, in general, favoured full economic cost recovery for services. Therefore, the Audit Commission will not be negotiating without an idea of the degree of cost recovery in its fee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us what mandate the commission will have in that respect? As there is grant element, it will not be full economic cost recovery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, what is the Audit Commission's additional work load estimated to be in terms of manpower? Knowing that will give us a global indication of costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, subsection (1) of new clause 5 refers to
	<br><q><p>"scale or scales of fees".</p></q>
When the Audit Commission charges a larger fee for onerous work or a lesser fee for a minor piece of work, is that incremental element subject to a scale agreed with the Secretary of State? Is there some framework to determine incremental elements above and below the normal fee or is the Audit Commission free to set its own charges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to clarify a point that I made in an earlier intervention, so that the Under-Secretary can reassure the Committee and people more widely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be a notional view on the likely scale of cost recovery. Now that negotiations are being entered into and discussions are on-going, it is unfeasible that such a view has not been established. I hope that the Under-Secretary will provide a notional view of the total burden that is likely to fall on local government. That will reassure Committee members with a legitimate interest in protecting the interests of local democracy and local government and the many people who are hanging on the Under-Secretary's every word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary did not reply to my earlier interventions, and that will give rise to scares and rumours that the burden might be greater than it may, in fact, be. The Under-Secretary has a real opportunity to reassure those who are fearing the worst by giving a figure in round millions of the extra costs that are likely to fall on local authorities. That will subdue the media and prevent the publication of scare stories that— unless the Under-Secretary takes advantage of this opportunity—will circulate in a wider arena.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adrian Sanders	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Torbay)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will address Government amendment No. 67 and new clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 67 appears to be a technical amendment, as the Audit Commission is not mentioned in part II of the Bill. Therefore, I do not think that anyone can object to it. However, new clause 5 is a mechanism for charging local authorities for the costs of the auditing of best value. Clearly, that will be a new net cost on local authorities. I am not sure that the Under-Secretary will be able to provide the figures that he has been asked for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the crux of the matter. Is it a net cost or a gross cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Almost certainly a new net cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I were a betting man and was given the odds, I would go down to Ladbroke's and put my money on that. The important question in whether the new burden will be weighted to reflect the different abilities of different tiers of local government to meet it. That is particularly important for unitary authorities and for district councils, about which there is some concern over what new funds might have to be found in future. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply but I doubt whether we will receive the explicit answers for which others have asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have several answers to the questions raised by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon and by the hon. Members for South Holland and the Deepings (Mr. Hayes) and for Torbay (Mr. Sanders).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can today provide a broad indicative figure of around £50 million for inspection and audit costs, but the ratio between fees and grants has not yet been determined and continues to be part of the consultation process. As to audit or inspections estimated to be distributed by the revenue support grant and accounted to SSA, the average local authority receiving an average number of audits will face no costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mole Valley rightly pointed out that there may be an additional burden on any authority for which additional in-depth inspections are necessary on account of consistent failure to achieve best value just to be sure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The distribution by revenue support grant goes via the mechanisms of SSAs, which are based on notional indicators. If what the Minister said is true, he cannot be basing it on actual expenditure. It must be based on notional expenditure, so a few authorities may receive exactly what they spend, some may not get the equivalent of what is paid in grant and others may be a bob or two in. Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There could be a possible alternative scenario with the RSG or SSA approach. Local authorities could be in hand, or will assessment be entirely retrospective? If it is not retrospective, will there be a clawback?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is no in respect of legislation passing through this place. We could not work on the basis of retrospection. That is a rule in British law and a standard set in this place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon's question, we can indicate only averages at present. The right hon. Gentleman who is well versed in the systems, criteria and methods used by the Department, well knows that and I provided him with an answer in my reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an Australian phrase that sometimes people do not know whether they are Arthur or Martha, which seems to apply here. I am not talking about retrospective legislation but about payment on a retrospective assessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>400</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, it applies to the year of operation: that is when it will be delivered in the RSG—in the requisite financial year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the intention here to operate a disincentive to local authorities? If they consistently fall foul of best value and find themselves with net costs that have not been reflected in their grant, is that somehow seen as a penalty, and therefore best avoided?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is best avoided if they can stop incurring extra expense through extra audits. Therefore, rightly, in that respect it is policing: that is what legislation does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the proportion of grant fee, we have not agreed the balance with the Audit Commission and representative organisations within local government. Until we do, it is all speculation, especially the way in which the draft amendment would change matters. We can give a balanced view—an overall figure, as the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon pointed out. There may occasionally be a cost to people within the new formula, but on average, we think that there will not be, and that this is a necessary amendment for this part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 220, in page 13, line 31, leave out subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is simply a probing amendment to give the Minister the opportunity to explain how the clause works. I have spent some time studying it and should be grateful if the hon. Lady would clarify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) states that an order under subsections (2) or (3) may appoint different days for different purposes. Why on earth would it be necessary to appoint different days? Would not it be simpler if everything was done the same day so that all local authorities knew where they were. That is what I assume was meant in our debate on general commencement. This seems an extra complication for which I fail to understand the need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Jon Owen Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Gentleman is yes, it would be simpler, but it might not work as well. That, in brief, is the reason for our inserting subsection (4) and for our opposition to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have consistently pointed out in Committee that the Bill creates a framework with a number of clearly identifiable features which will affect a wide range of different bodies. We need to commence the Bill's provisions in a manner that creates a smooth introduction for all aspects of the duty of best value
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0952">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>401</span>
and gives best value authorities the time and information that they need to prepare properly for their new obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) provides us with the flexibility to do that, as it allows us to commence the introduction of clauses at different times. My hon. Friend the Minister has said consistently that the intention in England is to introduce the general duty of best value from 1 April 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales, the date will be at the Assembly's discretion, subject to the 12-month limit introduced by clause 20(3). We expect that the Assembly will wish to adopt a similar approach to that followed in England, but we cannot anticipate that decision now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some clauses, notably clause 20(3) and those that introduce new arrangements for audit and inspection, would be expected to commence from 1 April next year. This makes operational sense and will facilitate proper comparisons of performance across financial years. There are others which in policy terms we would wish to commence earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities preparing for best value will, for example, wish to be certain of a statutory period within which they must complete a programme of reviews, and to know what are the specified matters with which the review must deal. Similarly, they will wish to know the nature of the performance indicators for best value so that they can put in place proper information-gathering and monitoring arrangements. Without labouring the point, if we are intent upon using statutory guidance to authorities about the transition between CCT and best value, it would be nonsensical if we were unable to do so until after CCT had been abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general intention is that in England the provisions which contain order-making or guidance powers will commence by order of the Secretary of State as soon as possible after the Bill obtains Royal Assent. As I said, that is not from a ministerial desire to exercise powers, but to use the Bill to help best value authorities to prepare as thoroughly as possible for the new challenge that awaits them. They are looking forward to that challenge and we want to help them to succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, I expect that the Welsh Assembly will want to follow suit. All Welsh authorities are currently involved in pilot studies on best value and are working towards a starting date of 1 April 2000. Subsection (4) is a prudent mechanism designed to smooth the introduction of the duty of best value and I hope that the hon. Member for North Essex, having probed the Government's intention, will ask leave to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman explained why the Welsh Assembly may want to time things differently from the Secretary of State in England. But the question remains why the Secretary of State in England would want to impose a different day for certain clauses to come into force. Why should clauses
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>402</span>
from 1 to 17 come into force on a different day from clause 19 and what would be the purpose of it? That is what I understand clause 20(4) allows the Secretary of State to do. Am I wrong about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I explained earlier that the purpose of subsection (4) is to give additional flexibility so that we can respond to the circumstances in which local authorities implement best value when they are ready to do so. Because different clauses do different things, it may be appropriate to commence those powers at different times, and it is therefore sensible to allow us the scope to do so if that best suits local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There appear to be two conflicting statements on timing in the Welsh local government White Paper which I do not understand, and I would like the Minister to explain them. Best value depends on a performance plan being published and paragraph 7.44 of the White Paper states that a plan's publication
	<br><q><p>"needs to be as near as possible to the end of the financial year, probably with 2 or 3 months at the end of the financial year".</p></q>
But the timing of the transitional arrangements, in paragraph 7.68, is rather conflicting, as it states that the duty of best value should be applied as quickly as possible after primary legislation is enacted. Given that elections to the Welsh Assembly are in May, how does the Minister explain those two policies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see no conflict. The Assembly will be elected in May, and its initial powers will be transferred in July. We want to implement best value in Wales as soon as we can and as soon as the Welsh Assembly decides that it can do so, which will no doubt be as soon as possible following the completion of the passage of the Bill through both Houses of Parliament. Perhaps it will want to do so before it can be done on this side of the Severn, but I see no conflict with what the hon. Gentleman has just read out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to think of an example of that. The Bill contains powers that we do not want to use but which are included in case they are considered necessary. I hope that the Welsh Assembly will not need to use some powers that might be used this side of the Severn. The powers will automatically come into force 12 months after Royal Assent has been received. If the hon.

However, if we are trying to introduce best value as soon as we can, clearly some parts that I have described could be introduced earlier. Surely we should wish to introduce elements of best value earlier if we can rather than wait until the last date for statutory compliance. From what Opposition Members have said, I would expect them to agree that that is a good thing to do.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Under-Secretary.

The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Secretary of State's powers are subject to the positive resolution procedure. Given the wide range of powers of intervention set out in clauses 4, 5, 6 and 7 on performance indicators, national standards, best value review, performance plans and audits, it is essential as a safeguard. If the clause is left unamended, only a negative resolution procedure would be left in force. That would leave the Secretary of State free to decide whether to debate the regulation unless Opposition parties prayed against it. Negative resolution procedure is not a fail-safe mechanism. For example, when the House resumed last autumn, and I was a novice Opposition Whip, I discovered on 19 October, through the publication of statutory instruments, that some days had to elapse before we could pray against important regulations. However, I did not realise that,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0954">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>405</span>
because the House of Lords sat a week before the House of Commons, the days on which the other place sat, and the weekends, counted as working days. Therefore, the set time had elapsed. It would have been impossible to pray against the regulations. There is a backstop mechanism, whereby an Opposition party can object even after a statutory instrument has been effected, but even to a novice, and certainly to the outside world, that is a slightly Kafkaesque procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Positive resolution clarifies matters and is a flagging mechanism for those who are expected to hold Governments to account. The Bill naively assumes that all Secretaries of State will be benign and wise and that the wide powers of intervention that the Bill grants them will be used wisely. If only we could be sure of that. We cannot and, therefore, we urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 221 seeks to reopen a debate that has already had a fair run. Nevertheless, we understand the hon. Members' anxieties about the extent to which Parliament can scrutinise the Government's exercise of their significant powers. Therefore, we have explicitly provided for affirmative resolution of the order-making powers in clauses 14 and 17, which would affect primary legislation. That also applies to clause 2, which could be used to bring new bodies into the ambit of best value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Orders made under clauses 4 to 7 would not affect other primary legislation and are, therefore, different. Those orders determine the precise combination of different elements in the framework. Powers to issue orders on the composition of reviews and performance plans are for the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales to determine, and the Bill lays out clearly the elements that we expect to be contained in those reviews and plans. Therefore, there is no need for further parliamentary scrutiny of the powers of clauses 5 and 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's order-making powers under clause 7 are confined to amending the date by which auditors must produce their reports on the local performance plans. Decisions about whether to use that power are at the Secretary of State's discretion in the light of practical experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall just finish the paragraph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In using the order-making powers under clause 4 to specify performance indicators, a Secretary of State is placed under an obligation to have regard to the recommendations of the Audit Commission. That is an important check on the manner in which those powers are used. A Secretary of State will also, in using the powers under this clause, be required to give proper consideration to the effect of orders on promoting authorities' achievement of the general duty of best value. Again, that is a real constraint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, the amendments are unhelpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>406</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to make an intervention, but that was a long paragraph, which turned out to be the last in the Under-Secretary's speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to support my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman). Clause 21(2) refers to
	<br><q><p>"annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament".</p></q>
There is an acceptance of the importance of such resolutions. The orders seem to have been downgraded, and I think that the Under-Secretary should reconsider. The best opportunity to give a real airing to an issue has to be in the House, rather than having a consultation, followed by a paper discussion with a junior Minister in the Secretary of State's Department. The Under-Secretary may reflect that, when he was in opposition and wanted to raise matters on behalf of local government, the best opportunity for doing so was in the House or Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always thought that Committees on statutory instruments are an excellent idea, even though they are sometimes exceedingly short, as the Minister for Local Government and Housing will recall. The Minister and I attended on such committee which lasted under 30 seconds. Such procedure does not delay matters in any way, but it gives us an opportunity for debates when there is cause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment No. 221, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden. I do not know whether members of the Committee are truly aware of how the nature of legislation has changed in the past 20 years. Just 10 years ago, the Local Government Act 1988 specified matters, in primary legislation, that could not be regarded as relevant to a contract. That provision was laid out in primary legislation, but in this Bill, such matters will be relegated to amendment by secondary legislation. There should be affirmative resolution in both Houses, but the trend is to move away from detailed primary legislation and to delegate powers to Ministers to enact by order, which is a much more discretionary power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Legislation has tended to become enabling. Clause 21 is a prime example of such enabling legislation. 	<i>[Interruption]</i> The hon. Member for Taunton says that the Conservative party started it. It goes back a long way—perhaps 100 or 150 years. It could have been the hon. Lady's party that started it, if we are being honest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a matter of who started it; it is a serious, constitutional question. I have figures from the Library showing that about 1,700 orders—subsidiary legislation—were put through the House of Commons in the first Session of this Parliament. Some were by affirmative resolution and there were some special orders, but about 1,500 were orders under the negative resolution procedure. Such orders are laid on the Table for 40 days, with weekends and Bank holidays included. The days tick past and the orders become law at the end of that period. In fact they can become law before the 40 days has expired. They are on the Table for 40 days to allow hon. Members to put down a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0955">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>407</span>
motion, which we call a prayer. Once the prayer is entered, there is no obligation on the Government even to allow time for a debate in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first year of this Government, there was an unusually high number of orders, and a smaller proportion of negative resolution orders was debated than ever before. Less than 1 per cent, of such orders were debated. In our day, when the Conservative Government were in power, the figure was 5 per cent, or 6 per cent. That was still not a satisfactory number, but it can be compared with the figure of less than 1 per cent, which are debated in Committee now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recall that the hon. Gentleman took an active part in the passage of the Government of Wales Act 1998 when he spoke from the Opposition Front Bench. Is he not arguing for framework legislation in the context of Welsh devolution? Although he is no doubt still hostile to the concept, the idea behind devolution in Wales is that framework legislation is passed and that secondary legislative power will go to Cardiff. Interestingly, the National Assembly for Wales will have a robust procedure, analogous to the affirmative resolution procedure of this House, for passing subordinate legislation. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, for Wales, this approach is entirely apt and sensible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The accountability of the procedure is obviously desirable and I am happy to acknowledge that. I doubt whether you would want us to go into too much detail on the Welsh Assembly, Mr. O'Brien, but the key question is whether the extra layer of bureaucracy will be popular in Wales. I do not want to go into the referendum in detail, but it was not a great triumph for Her Majesty's Government, who got the result they wanted by the skin of their teeth. It was one of the least credible yes votes that could possibly be achieved.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only a tiny number of orders will be subject to any scrutiny whatever. The amendment's purpose is to draw attention to the fact that we are increasing the number of orders and the power of the Secretary of State, removing the Secretary of State from accountability and further eroding the democratic principles for which this House was established. An affirmative resolution procedure need not necessarily be more bureaucratic. It may require the Minister to come and explain herself when a power is being

That was when we asked for examples, and the two examples that were given were those that I cited—class size and whether an order could be made, to limit the maximum number of carers that a child should be obliged to endure during his or her time in care.

We were given a brief lecture on the concept of devolution, and were told that the Assembly for Wales would have a robust procedure for scrutinising secondary legislation. We are anxious that, in the case of doubt, powers are to be retained by the Secretary of State. These probing amendments, which seek clarification from the Government, would remove the exemptions being retained in respect of the section listed in the clause. We do not understand why the negative resolution powers in clause 21, for example, or, indeed, affirmative resolution powers, should be retained in Westminster.

The Committee will know from previous debates that we do not like Henry VIII powers, but why should one of the few reserve powers to be retained in Westminster relate to local government? I understand that my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman purports to speak for Wales, although he comes from Shropshire. I am sorry to interrupt him at such an early stage in his speech, but I must tell him that there is no such unitary authority as Aberconwy council. There is a unitary authority called Conwy county borough council. Could the hon. Gentleman please be more accurate when he describes local authority structures in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the hon. Member for Clwyd, West bursts into life, having sat in total silence, like one of the cauliflowers that I mentioned earlier, for most of our debate. I am giving recent evidence from local authorities—they are not all unitary authorities—which have flagrantly refused to co-operate with the competitive legislation introduced by the previous Government. The council that I mentioned had four separate notices under sections 13 to 19 brought against it. The hon. Gentleman may be happier with the example of Cardiff, where the new institution will be opened, and which will be the centre of the new Wales which has been talked about. Cardiff received three notices, two under section 19 and one under section 13, all for financial failure related to buildings, maintenance, construction and catering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The list goes on. Merthyr Tydfil, one of the worst, had a section 19 notice for financial failure on buildings maintenance. A row is going on at the

moment about the 1999 rubbish removal contract. Biffa made the lowest bid, but the council gave it to its DLO. The Welsh Office imposed a section 13 notice, which was effectively a shot across the bows, but did not get a satisfactory response, so a section 14 notice, which demands action, was imposed. It had to re-tender the contract, without the DLO. Biffa did not bother to apply at that time and a French company called Ecover won the contract. Still the council would not accept it. It applied to the Welsh Office to reinstate the DLO. As I understand it, the Secretary of State is still considering the matter. This is the state of play in many councils; it is a most unhappy time to be introducing a less rigorous system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 1 February the Minister kindly sent us a huge wodge—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene to try to help. The hon. Member for North Shropshire may not have heard in an earlier debate that compulsory competitive tendering was suspended in Wales a number of years ago by the previous Government as a result of preparations that were under way to bring in unitary authorities. That suspension has continued. So, even if the hon. Gentleman argued that CCT was better than best value—and I am not sure that he did—in no way could best value be regarded as a less rigorous procedure than the currently applying conditions in which CCT is suspended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Under-Secretary for that. I am fully aware of the circumstances. I have quoted councils that have been taken to the central authority, which, currently, is the Secretary of State, because they have not selected the most competitive choice of contract for their tax payers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reviews of pilot studies are also not encouraging. There is a great deal of evidence from them, all printed in double spacing. Paper No. 10 contains very little hard fact and its examples are not encouraging either. For Torfaen, its classic, local government waffley managementspeak states:
	<br><q><p>"Torfaen has a central review process which requires services to analyse their services against a number of themes (efficiency, competitiveness, partnership, quality, performance indicators, comparisons and appropriateness)"</p></q>
and so on. A review of the facts shows that Torfaen has had five section 19 notices and a section 13 notice served on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reading elsewhere in the review of pilot schemes, one can almost hear the sigh of relief from these authorities as the pressure is taken off them. Paper No. 6, referring to the mid and west Wales fire brigade, suggests:
	<br><q><p>"With the evident lack of competition for fire brigade core services supported by the wish of the local communities that the service should be provided by the public sector, benchmarking would provide it with appropriate information to assist in achieving better practice."</p></q>
One can just feel that the pressure has been lifted off the accelerator and that they are sighing with relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to be helpful. I prefer to deal with some of these points now rather than later, when I shall talk about the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>412</span>
The Welsh Office is currently looking at the position of direct labour organisations for the year 1997–98, which was the Government's first year of office. From my memory of the phone calls that I received at the time, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that any suggestion that the pressure is off is certainly not the view of local authorities or their trade union representatives. I cannot make an announcement now about what notices may or may not be served because I am considering carefully the Welsh Office's position on each of them. But it is a travesty to say that the Welsh Office has taken the pressure off local authorities. It is true that some direct labour organisations have had serious losses. I have expressed forcibly my disapproval of that and have told local authorities to get their DLOs into a non loss-making position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary but I am not convinced. The facts are before us. It is clear from these lengthy documents and the pilot scheme reviews that there is no evidence, no hard facts, just waffley gobbledegook. What on earth is meant by the following lines on page 25 of paper No. 9, one of those that the Minister gave us on 1 February:
	<br><q><p>"balance the managerial attractions of a (holistic and integrating) corporate 'top-down' initiative, with encouraging innovation, creativity and sensitivity from front-line staff'.</p></q>
Everything is wrapped up in waffley management-speak. There are no hard facts about how the Assembly will put pressure on councils. The Government of Wales Act 1998 says little about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister would comment on the fact that the main provision on local government in the Government of Wales Act 1998 is on the partnership council. That Act says more about the partnership council than about how the Assembly will control local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is huge uncertainty. None of us knows how the Assembly will work. It will be a Crown body responsible to the Secretary of State, with elected members and certain executive powers. It will be elected in May. The Minister is confident that the timetable will be adhered to, but I am not because it is a new institution with a new building and the sheer practicalities will defy many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments should be accepted because, at a time of great uncertainty, they would allow Parliament some surveillance over the contracting of local services in Wales and the introduction of a new authority for which the detail has clearly not been worked out; it is not in the 1998 Act. I should like the Minister to clarify how all that will be done. If he cannot do so, he should support our amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I oppose the Liberal Democrat and Conservatives amendments. Amendments Nos. 233 and 234, tabled by the Liberal Democrats, would grant the National Assembly for Wales order making powers over the police and fire authorities. Crucially, those responsibilities have not been devolved to the Secretary of State for Wales; they have certainly not been devolved to the National Assembly for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0958">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>413</span>
The fact that the Liberal Democrats have tabled those amendments shows confusion and woolliness, which is rather surprising given their claim to be a serious party of local government in Wales. However, it is perhaps understandable, in so far as the Liberal Democrats have not been able to muster a single member of their Welsh parliamentary party to serve on this important Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the devolution of Home Office powers to the National Assembly for Wales, although I am conscious of the need to stay within the parameters of the amendments. Will my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary tell us how consistency can be ensured if the intention is to create a best value regime for unitary authorities and for that to be administered and policed by the National Assembly for Wales, while leaving out of that regime police and fire authorities, which are none the less defined in the Bill as best value authorities? That is not intended to be a hostile point; it is a probing point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind the Government's intention, with which I agree wholeheartedly, to implement joined-up government—a cross-cutting approach—how can we ensure consistency? It is entirely sensible that the amendments should be rejected because they display confusion and a misunderstanding of the Government of Wales Act 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the second limb of the amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats. Again, I am sorry to say that they display an ignorance of the implications of the Government of Wales Act 1998, which confers subordinate, not primary, legislative powers on the Assembly. It does not confer the sort of powers that are implicitly given in clause 14. The amendment is fundamentally flawed. Amendment No. 233 is otiose, because clause 22(1)(b) provides that the Welsh Assembly would retain secondary legislative powers over those areas. That does not need to be separately spelt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Liberal Democrat amendments demonstrate a willingness to help and a good-natured confusion, the Conservative amendments demonstrate their unreconstructed hostility to devolution and refusal to come to terms with the fact that, although the referendum result in Wales was narrow, it was none the less a yes. The Conservative party is putting up candidates for the Assembly—I hope that it will adopt a more positive approach to the work of the Assembly than it appears to display in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seem to remember that one of the assurances that had to be given in order to extract that ringing endorsement for the Assembly from the Welsh people was that the rights and powers of local authorities would not be affected by the the transfer of powers from Westminster to the Assembly. Where in the Bill are powers transferred to local authorities? Does it not take powers away from them and give them to the Welsh Assembly—exactly what the Government said would not occur?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>414</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing inconsistent about the Government's approach, which is supportive of local government. The hon. Gentleman knows that the Government have made a major commitment, enshrined in the Government of Wales Act, that a partnership council will be established between local government and regional government, in the form of the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important point, of which the official Opposition seem to have lost sight—I am surprised by the hon. Member for North Essex, whose memory seems remarkably short; he should remember that the Government of Wales Act was fully debated on the Floor of the House—is that the measures that provide for the Assembly to scrutinise secondary legislation were fully debated and found to be acceptable by the House. The Assembly will scrutinise secondary legislative power more thoroughly than sometimes occurs in the House. It will adopt an affirmative resolution procedure, to both the so-called fast-track and slow-track approaches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that the Government of Wales Act disapplies parliamentary scrutiny procedures on secondary legislative powers that have been devolved to the Assembly. The hon. Member for North Essex needs to ask himself how on earth the Conservative amendments could be consistent with the primary legislation of the Government of Wales Act. Are not the official Opposition betraying the true motive behind their amendments—an attempt to undermine the concept and project of devolution, at the same time as taking it seriously enough to present candidates for the elections on 6 May? It beggars belief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman appeared to be critical of how the House considers legislation, but did not support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden to scrutinise legislation in more detail and with better discernment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The House is undergoing a constant process of modernisation, which applies to not only domestic but European legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments, if passed, which I am sure they will not be, would undermine the Government of Wales Act 1998.1 therefore ask the official Opposition and, for that matter, Liberal Democrats, to withdraw them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 22 deals with the application of part I of the Bill in Wales. It provides generally for the powers in part I to be exercised by the National Assembly rather than the Secretary of State. The provisions are appropriate and necessary. The Assembly will be the devolved arm of central Government in Wales, and will take over the responsibilities that the Secretary of State exercises in Wales for local government. It will be responsible for the administration of best value in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0959">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>415</span>
The clause gives effect to the commitment in the White Paper "A Voice for Wales", which states that
	<br><q><p>"as a general principle, the Government expects Bills that confer new powers and relate to the Assembly's functions... will provide for the powers to be exercised separately and differently in Wales; and to be exercised by the Assembly."</p></q>
This is the first Bill since the Government of Wales Act to confer powers on the Assembly, and I am pleased that it recognises the role that the Assembly will play in ensuring that Welsh local authorities deliver best value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not apply to police or fire authorities in Wales, because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West has already said, responsibility for those authorities will remain with the Secretary of State for the Home Department. It would therefore not be appropriate to transfer the order-making powers in respect of those best value authorities to the National Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West raised the issue of consistency. Local authorities in England and Wales need to work with the police and fire authorities on cross-cutting issues such as social exclusion, crime and disorder and prevention of crime. Challenges to consistency will arise. Devolution itself gives rise to such challenges. However, it is clearly advantageous for the Assembly and local government in Wales to ensure that they have consistent procedures so that they are effective in delivering policies such as what we call social inclusion in Wales, or crime prevention, or in achieving whatever objective they want to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause also provides for other order-making powers to remain with the Secretary of State. The power to make orders under clause 14 will be exercised by the Secretary of State rather than the National Assembly. Those are wide-ranging powers to amend primary legislation, and the Government do not consider it appropriate to transfer them to the Assembly. However, the Secretary of State will be able to exercise powers under clause 14 in relation to Wales, only after having consulted the National Assembly. In addition, the Secretary of State cannot exercise his powers under clause 14 to amend legislation made by the Assembly without having first received its consent. The provisions are necessary safeguards for the National Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 22 also provides for the power to make orders under clause 16 to be exercised in Wales by the Secretary of State rather than by the Assembly. Clause 16 widens the application of section 70 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 to cover all best value authorities. In Wales, section 70 would be extended by clause 16 to apply to national parks authorities. The transfer of functions order that transfers the powers of the Secretary of State to the National Assembly is being laid before Parliament today. Consideration is still being given to whether the powers in section 70 should be transferred to the Assembly. The final version of the Bill will need to be consistent with the outcome of the further deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>416</span>
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under amendments Nos. 222, 223 and 224 the orders made by the assembly would be subject to parliamentary procedures rather than the assembly's own procedures. The Opposition again seem determined to resurrect the devolution debate by tabling these amendments. Parliament has already decided in approving the Government of Wales Act that the Assembly will have its own powers to make subordinate legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) has again advanced arguments that rehash those that we heard about devolution in Wales. When he was Secretary of State for Wales in the late 1970s, my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General described in a memorable phrase the outcome of an earlier referendum as being an elephant on his doorstep. The elephant was the settled will of the people of Wales at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since then, we have won a general election in Wales on the pledge to set up an Assembly in Wales. We have won a referendum having first taken a referendum Bill and then a Government of Wales Bill through this House. Yet the Tory party is still not prepared to recognise the elephant that sits on its doorstep.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the elephant on the doorstep of the official Opposition the fact that they have no parliamentary representation in this House from Wales and, for that matter, from Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to the last intervention. The irony is that in the electoral arrangements for setting up the National Assembly in Wales and the Scottish Parliament, we provide an opportunity for the Conservative party to be represented.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may recall that the conversation was elephants on doorsteps.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman needs to make his approach consistent with that of the hon. Member for North Shropshire, who said that local authorities

would have an easy ride because the Assembly would have insufficient powers to reign them in with regard to loss-making direct labour organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrat members who tabled amendments Nos. 232 and 233 clearly understand and support the principle of devolution. However, sections 66 and 67 of the Government of Wales Act already enable the National Assembly for Wales to make subordinate legislation. Therefore, separate provision in the Bill is not required, and the amendments are unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West has already explained that the Assembly will not have powers over the police authority and the fire authority. The Government of Wales Act 1998 did not provide for such powers, and they reside with the Home Office. Therefore, amendment No. 234 is unnecessary.
