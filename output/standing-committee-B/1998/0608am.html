	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I am sorry to delay the Committee, if only for a moment. At the end of our debate on clause 50 and schedule 6 on 25 May, I was asked a question by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) about the application of schedule 6 to different types of fitting-out costs. I undertook to take further advice, and I would now like to clarify the position. Fitting-out costs will normally procure tenant's or trade fixtures, which, as a matter of general property law, the tenant has a right to remove at the end of the lease. Even if the parties make a special agreement that those assets will belong to the landlord at the end of the lease, a landlord's contribution to the cost of providing them will still be assessable as a payment by way of inducement to take the lease. The test is not to whom the assets belong at the end of the lease, but whether their provision enhances the value of the reversionary interest, or permits the landlord to command a higher market rent on a rent review. I hope that that clarifies the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I am sure the Economic Secretary will understand, that is not a point of order for me, but Committee members will have taken note of her comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Burnett (Torridge and West Devon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>484</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Financial Secretary for circulating to the Committee copies of her letter setting out the Government's amendments to clause 59. The amendments go some way to answering the concerns expressed by Opposition Members and by experts outside about the drafting of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the clause is an anti-avoidance measure. We all support any effort to close loopholes that prevent the proper collection of tax but, unfortunately, in the original draft, the scope of the clause was too wide and seemed to encompass any bond that included the possibility of early redemption. Of course, it is a feature of most bonds that they envisage circumstances in which early redemption might take place. Certain events may befall the company that issued the bonds or there might be changes in the tax system, with the result that the terms on which the bond was originally issued no longer apply. In particular, there might be changes in the tax system regarding withholding tax, which we shall discuss in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our first three amendments clarify that any bond can be called early by agreement between the parties issuing and buying the bond, but there must be a specific power in the bond to call early. We believe that our amendment may have been picked up in the amendments proposed by the Financial Secretary in what I believe is no. 2 of her draft amendments. I hope that she will clarify the intention of that draft amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the reference at the top of page 35 of the Bill to sub-paragraph (5) of the Finance Act 1996, should be a reference to sub-paragraph 5(b). We understand from experts in the industry that tax is avoided by exploiting the loophole in sub-paragraph 5(b) and that making the clause apply to the whole of sub-paragraph 5 betrays the Government's ignorance of the bond market and causes great concern. The spokesman for the International Primary Market Association said of the proposals:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Insurance companies and unit trusts could be hit very badly".</p></blockquote>
A partner at Linklaters, a leading firm of City solicitors, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are concerned about this new tax threat arising at a time when the London bond market has already been unsettled by the proposed EC withholding tax."</p></blockquote>
The lesson to be learned from the clause and the Government's belated attempt to put it right is that advice from the industry on technical clauses should be sought in advance of such legislation being introduced. The uncertainty created in the London market by the inappropriate drafting of clauses does no credit to the Government or the standing of the City of London and in many ways goes against the principles of the stability code under which the Government promised to act. They said that their tax policies would be transparent and clear, but it is evident from the confusion about clause 59 that they are not. The clause was not clear and sowed confusion. We tabled probing amendments in our inexpert but loyal Opposition way to prompt the Government to provide a better and clearer solution, which they should have provided initially. I look forward to the Financial Secretary's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0278">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>485</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Committee if I begin with a brief explanation of the purpose of clause 59. With clause 60, which is consequential, it was designed to prevent leakage of taxpayers' money through an artificial avoidance scheme. I welcome the comments of the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) in a similar vein. The scheme works by exploiting a weakness in the definition of a discounted security so that the discount on the security, which should be taxed as income over the lifetime of the security, is in fact charged only to capital gains tax and only when the security is disposed of or redeemed. The clause makes a small change in the definition of a discounted security so that that trick will no longer be possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 15 February, the Inland Revenue issued a press release announcing the Government's intention to stop the loophole and we propose that the clause should take effect from that day. That may catch avoidance devices that have already been entered into, but where the return has not yet been received. Avoiders have been warned in the past that future measures may have immediate effect in this way and a similar provision was a feature of last year's Finance Bill. I have said before that tax abuse is against the public interest and those engaging in it do so at their own risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Guildford explained the fears expressed by lawyers and others who advise on the tax consequences of security issues about clause 59. It was necessary to introduce the clause to close a glaring loophole in the definition of relevant discounted securities that was allowing tens of millions of pounds of tax to be avoided, and we should not forget that figure in our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The complaint is that the clause goes too far—it now catches securities where any discount that arises is small in absolute terms and only obtainable on the happening of an event that is outside the control of the parties to the security. The amendments introduce three changes. The first would prevent any redemptions for which the terms of the issue of the security do not provide, from being taken into account in determining whether it should be classified as a relevant discounted security. The other two would restore the rule whereby only redemptions before maturity that can be triggered by the holder are taken into account in deciding whether a deep gain is possible. The amendments would go even further than the original rule by removing cases that might produce a deep gain as well as those that do or will do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have received representations about the clause, and, after examination of those, we recognise that clause 59 may catch some securities where it would not be appropriate to do so. Removing the clause's teeth, however, would not be the remedy. The amendments would reopen the door to schemes to which the clause is designed to put an end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, we accept that changes are necessary, and we have published draft amendments for consultation. I wrote to you and your co-Chairman last week, Mr. Butterfill, enclosing a copy of the draft amendments and an accompanying Inland Revenue press release. As the hon. Member for Guildford said, a
	<span class='label label-info column'>486</span>
copy of that letter has been sent to each Committee member, and to the Clerk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft amendments target the clause more closely on the objectionable transactions, and should meet the concerns that have been expressed about the clause, without reopening the possibility of avoidance. When we have taken into account comments on the draft versions, amendments will be tabled on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Guildford raised a couple of points in relation to why consultation had not taken place before. As he will know, discounted securities may be issued in a wide range of circumstances and with an almost endless range of different clauses and divisions. As the clause is an anti-avoidance measure, and substantial amounts of taxpayer's money are at stake, it would not be appropriate to issue a draft for consultation before the measure came into effect. The Finance Bill process allows for consultation on the details of the measure and for its improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Guildford appeared to suggest that things used to be done differently. Such collective amnesia appears to afflict Conservative Members so often that I am tempted to ask my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health to conduct an urgent public inquiry. Some Committee members—and certainly my hon. Friend the Paymaster General, who was a member of the shadow Treasury team—will recall the gilts and bonds legislation that was introduced by the Conservative Government in 1996. Not only did the Finance Bill Committee have to consider 200 amendments—which were mostly tabled two days before the event—but the Government of the day had to ask it to vote against whole clauses, which were subsequently replaced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise that matter not to criticise Conservative Members, but to assist them in recovering their memory. I accept the assertion of the hon. Member for Guildford that the amendments were tabled in a probing spirit, and I hope that I have given him a full response. I ask him to withdraw the amendment. If he will not, I shall ask my hon. Friends to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have admitted that the clause is badly drafted and ill-thought-through. Unless it is amended on Report, innocent arrangements such as unit trusts, investment trusts and insurance funds will be brought within the scope of the anti-avoidance provisions. Unamended, the clause will increase the tax burden on unit trusts, investment trusts and non-commission insurance funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We appreciate that the Government have understood the problems that would be caused by the clause. However, given that the problems became clear within weeks of the Bill's publication on 15 March, why has it taken until 3 June to publish draft amendments? That will give only a few weeks until Report for interested parties to examine the two and a half pages of amendments to be tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amended clause 59 is now hugely cumbersome, and totally against the spirit of tax simplification. Will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0279">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>487</span>
the Minister explain what is meant by draft amendment No. 3? Suggested new sub-paragraph (1A)(b)(ii) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"nothing in this sub-paragraph shall require an occasion on which a security may be redeemed to be disregarded by reason only that it is or may be an occasion that coincides with an occasion mentioned in this sub-paragraph?"</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister also explain what is proposed by draft amendment No. 4 and proposed new sub-paragraph (2E)? Is this a new anti-avoidance measure, totally unconnected to that proposed in the original clause 59?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the fact that those amendments will be debated on Report, I do not intend to press amendments Nos. 140 and 141.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me say to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb)—I hope that I have not forgotten the exact name of his constituency over the Whitsun recess—that the Government have consulted widely on the matter since it became clear that changes would be necessary. We shall publish our findings at the earliest opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman knows, the parties interested in the measure are specialists, with a capacity to study the proposals in great detail in a short time. The comments that we have received so far from professional bodies suggest that there is a great deal of applause for the Government's proposals. The hon. Gentleman asked a number of questions about the amendments. I shall respond in general terms, because we shall have the opportunity on Report to examine them more closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause as drafted, it is possible that perfectly innocent provisions for early redemption could lead to the security being classified as a deep discounted security: for example, a provision for a premium to be paid if the issuer chooses to redeem early. That is only intended to compensate holders for any difference between the interest paid on the bond and the market rates of interest prevailing at the time of redemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's draft amendments provide that the clause is not generally to apply to redemptions that are not at the holder's option, or that are at the holder's option but arises only as a result of an unlikely event, which would adversely affect the interests of the holder if there were no possibility of redemption. However, the clause will continue to apply to some redemptions where the holder and issuer are connected, or where tax avoidance is involved. That should protect the problem areas covered in the representations, while still safeguarding against tax avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have set out the Government's position on the matter, and I look forward to hearing the hon. Gentleman's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always interested to hear the Government's perspective on the record of the previous Government. We know that it is distorted. However, we have learned from any mistakes that we made while in government. The present Government seem determined to repeat them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The anti-avoidance scheme targeted by the clause was heralded by a press release issued by the Inland Revenue
	<span class='label label-info column'>488</span>
on 15 February, before the Budget. The Government aim to prevent further abuse of the tax system. Before the Bill's publication, they had plenty of time to consult with the industry on the proper phrasing of the clause without jeopardising that aim. I hope that they have learnt the lesson that, to draft legislation properly, they should consult the experts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, the Government's approach has disturbed the City, but the message seems finally to have got through. The Financial Secretary has promised to listen to the industry before clauses are presented on Report, and in the light of the constructive spirit in which she has put her case this morning, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 178, in page 34, line 46, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1B) Where a security may be redeemed before maturity consequent to the introduction of any witholding tax at source on the interest payable by the issuer, then such security may not be regarded as a "relevant discounted security" solely as a result of either the existence or the exercise of such a power of early redemption.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 176,inpage35,line4,after"15thFebruary 1999" insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless it is a security subject to a witholding tax at source on the interest payable by the issuer.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 177, in page 35, line 6, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless the payment relates to a security subject to a withholding tax at source on the interest payable by the issuer.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to the regrettable complexity of the Government's proposed amendments. I question whether that complexity is in accordance with the code for fiscal stability, which requires tax rules to be transparent, fair and efficient. One cannot help thinking that the clauses have been drafted in a complex way to elide the problem of a withholding tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter hinges on whether a withholding tax is likely to be imposed. If it is, many bonds may be caught by clause 59. So far, we do not know whether a European withholding tax of the sort that the City fears is likely to be imposed. Time and again, the Government have dithered and given out conflicting messages. We have heard one tune from Parliament, while another is played in Brussels and in the relevant meetings of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the code for fiscal stability is supposed to make clear projections of likely outcomes, does the Financial Secretary believe that there is the remotest possibility of the imposition of a withholding tax on this country and the City? If one were imposed, a large number of eurobonds would immediately become callable. Many eurobonds contain clauses that allow for early redemption if such a tax is imposed. Typically, they allow investors' incomes to be grossed up, so that the cash received equals the amount that would have been received before the imposition of the tax. That places an extra interest burden on the issuing company. Typically,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>489</span>
as a quid pro quo to the issuing company, the bonds allow the company to call the bond early. In other cases, the tax is suffered by the investor, who has the option to call the bond early.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The IPMA, which speaks for the industry in this field, has calculated that a withholding tax will cost British investors billions of pounds through their pension funds, unit trusts and insurance company product investments. Many bonds that are issued at much higher interest rates are currently trading at a premium. Once a withholding tax is introduced, they will be redeemed early by companies that exercise their option. That one-off penalty will cost British pension funds alone more than £500 million because 10 per cent, of outstanding sterling eurobond issues are trading above par and will be affected by a withholding tax. According to calculations that I looked up with the IPMA earlier this year, pension funds would have to reinvest in bonds at a cost of £500 million to secure the same income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see some confusion among Treasury Ministers, but a bond that was issued a few years ago at a fixed interest rate of 9 or 10 per cent, might be reissued at a rate of only 5 or 6 per cent. That loss of interest would be reflected in the price of the bond. In the next few years, the pension fund would lose that extra interest or have to put extra money into bonds to achieve that interest.

The second issue is how the clause will deal with the problem. I do not pretend that our changes to the clause are perfect, but they try to make it clear that clause 59 would not apply if the withholding tax were imposed. The Financial Secretary owes it to the Committee to explain how her proposals will exempt bonds that might be called early in the event of a withholding tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would remove from the scope of the clause any securities on which interest is paid subject to withholding tax, as the hon. Member for Guildford outlined. I understand that he wants to protect the United Kingdom financial sector from damage. The Government fully share that concern, as we have made clear a number of times when we have spoken about the draft European Community directive on the taxation of savings. However, neither the amendments nor the clause have a real bearing on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The savings directive as drafted would apply to interest payments on a security, which might or might not also be discounted, that were paid to an individual cross-border within the Community. The clause deals with the tax treatment of discount. It is aimed at a wholly artificial tax avoidance device, which relies on getting discounts that should be taxed as income reclassified as capital. The amendments would prevent the clause from applying to a wide range of securities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the draft directive, we have no intention of agreeing to a course of action that would seriously damage the UK and other European financial markets. We have made it clear that the draft directive is not acceptable in its present form. The Prime Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we will use the veto if necessary"—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 26 May 1999; Vol. 332, c. 345.].</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>490</span>
However, there are signs that we are winning the argument. Our European partners and the Commission fully recognise the need to protect the legitimate interests of the financial markets. We have always been committed to that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Guildford rightly mentioned the concern of the City of London. It is instructive to hear what the City has to say about what the Government are doing. Judith Mayhew of The Corporation of London, who is, I think, respected on both sides of the House, was recently asked on the "Today" programme to comment on how strongly the Government were fighting the City' s corner. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Oh very strong. I mean the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have said that they will do nothing to damage the markets of the City of London because they recognise how important we are to the economy of this country."</p></blockquote>
Thus the City of London, at the very highest level, recognises that the Government are doing their utmost in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Burnett (Torridge and West Devon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Financial Secretary would like to write to me in response to this question. Although I have not read the new clause in detail, I understand that it will provide for some exceptions to the rule that will bring into charge some discount securities. Will one of those exceptions be a change in control of the issuer if the issuer is entirely unconnected with the holder?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has had an opportunity to read the draft amendments that we issued with the press release, which deal with those relationships. I hope that we shall have a detailed debate on the matter on Report. We are receiving several representations on the draft amendments, and are actively considering the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. Member for Guildford, who had the good grace to say that his amendments were not perfect, to withdraw them after proper consideration. I detect that he is suffering from a sore throat, and will, therefore, not draw too much attention to the fact that they are defective because the word "witholding" is misspelt throughout. I was slightly surprised about that, but, because of his sore throat, I shall say nothing more about it. I hope that he will withdraw the amendments, but if he does not, I urge the Committee to reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful for the Financial Secretary' s consideration for my health. She says that the amendments would narrow the scope of the clause, but so will her own amendments. I do not regard that as a criticism of what we are trying to do. She has not explained what will happen if a withholding tax is introduced along with the clauses that she proposes. Will her new amendments catch the early redemptions that the withholding tax might trigger? Although she is not prepared to answer that question now, she must do so before we reach Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government protest that they are determined to stand up for the City of London. The previous Government explained to our partners that a withholding tax would not work, and that was why they vetoed it.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>491</span>
When we took that action, the Labour party supported us, and the matter died a death. That was a simple way of dealing with a threat to the City of London, and it is startling that the Government do not recognise that that is how to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a real danger that the Government will agree to some form of withholding tax that they regard as innocuous, but which in the process removes our ability to veto a ratcheting-up of the withholding tax in future, or that they will agree to a bureaucratic requirement imposing excessive reporting on people based in the City of London, which will drive business away to other financial centres such as Geneva and New York. We remain worried about the Government's attitude to withholding tax because they do not realise that.

On page 6, item 7 of "The Code for Fiscal Stability" states:

Does the Financial Secretary agree that the incidence of a withholding tax in this country, as opposed to its incidence in Germany, would be contrary to that principle of the code for fiscal stability?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be a conundrum in the clause. Venture capital trusts are, in many senses, a tax-saving vehicle. People who invest in them receive
	<span class='label label-info column'>492</span>
certain tax reliefs. It would be wrong to suppose that the only purpose of investing in VCTs would be to save tax, but those trusts, with their attendant tax reliefs, would be pointless unless that purpose were recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 63 inserts a new section into the Taxes Act 1988 that provides that such shares should be
	<br><blockquote><p>"acquired for bona fide commercial purposes and not as part of a scheme or arrangement the main purpose of which, or one of the main purposes of which, is the avoidance of tax."</p></blockquote>
That would surely capture everyone who invests in a venture capital trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of us would want to hinder successful and wise attempts to close a tax loophole, but I move the amendment to make it clear that the primary or "overriding purpose" is the avoidance of tax. Otherwise, clause 63 may discourage many people from making such investments. As the name implies, venture capital trusts are high-risk investments. It should not be the Government's job to impose a further unquantifiable tax risk on people who make such investments for sound economic reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee of the tax privileges that venture capital trusts contain. First, they are exempt from capital gains tax on their own investment gains. Secondly, shareholders in venture capital trusts are entitled to income tax relief at 20 per cent., with a limit of £100,000 a year. Thirdly, there is reinvestment relief—that is, deferral of capital gains tax where the gain is invested in venture capital trust shares. Fourthly, there is a capital gains tax exemption on exit from a venture capital trust. Fifthly, there is no income tax to be paid on dividends accruing from venture capital trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems odd, as my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford said, to propose a clause that provides that people should not enter into such arrangements if their main purpose is tax avoidance. The purpose of venture capital trusts is to encourage people to invest in the shares, in many cases solely to gain a tax advantage. As the Institute of Directors said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Investors are naturally attracted to venture capital trusts by the prospect of tax savings—indeed the tax savings were introduced so as to attract investors … If the Government is concerned at particular forms of tax avoidance, then targeted anti-avoidance measures should be introduced."</p></blockquote>
It would help the Committee if the Financial Secretary set out what the Government hope to catch and why such a widely drafted clause has been used to try to catch avoidance schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled by the amendment. When the previous Government introduced the VCT scheme, they were rightly concerned to deter abuse. I think that the hon. Member for Guildford said earlier that he knew of and wanted to talk bravely about the mistakes that the previous Government made. However, I want to try to salvage something of the hon. Gentleman's career as he may have hopes of preferment to the shadow Front Bench. I do not want to do anything to stop his career in its tracks, so I hope that I can persuade him not to press the amendment to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>493</span>
The rules governing the subject were introduced by the Conservative Government in 1995 to protect VCT dividend exemption and the other tax reliefs that they applied to VCT investment. The amendment would weaken what was introduced by making it necessary to demonstrate a bona fide commercial purpose only, so tax exemption would be due even if the main purpose of the investment was tax avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Guildford can scarcely fail to be aware that the form of words that the amendment seeks to change was used by the Conservatives in government throughout the Taxes Management Act 1970 when anti-avoidance measures were appropriate. I know that the Opposition are rightly considering some changes to their policy, but I have seen nothing to suggest that they have sought to consider again how they phrased their own legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Financial Secretary recognise the difference between anti-avoidance legislation and anti-avoidance legislation that deals with tax incentives, and that when someone does something on the basis of a tax incentive, the anti-avoidance legislation wording must be distinct from that in other cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point and will deal with it if he allows me to make some progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Government were content to adopt the formulation on several occasions, such as when they introduced the rules for the purchase by a small company of its own shares in relation to the enterprise investment scheme. The purpose of clause 63 is to ensure delivery of the protection against abuse that the current provision is intended to give. It should therefore come as no surprise to the hon. Member for Guildford that we are not minded to accept his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Guildford and for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked several questions about incentives. The rule will not apply if investors take advantage merely of the tax incentives offered to them under VCTs in straightforward circumstances. However, if the form of the acquisition is contrived so as to give an investor the relief when, in substance, the acquisition would not have qualified, it will be wholly appropriate that the rules apply to deny the benefit of exemption on any dividends paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton spoke about the effect of the clause and asked why it was so broadly drafted. A new rule is not being introduced under the clause; we are simply correcting the defect in the existing rule that was introduced under the original VCT provisions in the Finance Act 1996. We are making the legislation that the previous Government introduced work better, but I do not expect a note of congratulation from the hon. Member for Guildford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the VCT scheme is to encourage investment by qualifying individuals who might not
	<span class='label label-info column'>494</span>
otherwise invest. The rule amended under the clause supports that purpose by ensuring that investors who intend to misuse the scheme do not benefit from the tax exemption. I hope that I have convinced the hon. Member for Guildford to withdraw the amendment. If not, I shall ask my hon. Friends to oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Financial Secretary for enunciating the position so clearly. That will go some way to relieving people's concerns about how the clause has been drafted. However, deficiencies remain in the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"one of the main purposes of which is the avoidance of tax",</p></blockquote>
which is used in the clause. It would be nice to think that the new Government might have been innovative and that, in 18 years, Labour Members might have thought of a better phrase. They have recognised the deficiencies of the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend not share my concern that the measure is yet another example of the Government using broadly drafted clauses to give the Revenue considerable discretionary power about whether to approve a scheme or a relief that is tempered by extra-statutory statements? The Financial Secretary has made such an extra-statement today, which, under Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart, will effectively become law. That is the wrong way to go about such matters. We hope that, if the Revenue has too much discretionary power, it will not exert it in the commercial marketplace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart was at the fore of all our minds this morning when listening to the Finanical Secretary. I sense that the Revenue might make a statement about an extra-statutory concession. However, at least the Revenue will have listened as carefully as we have to the Finanical Secretary and will apply clause 63 in the narrow sense in which she explained it, so that it will not be used to attack bona fide schemes in which investors legitimately receive tax advantages as a quid pro quo for the risk involved in VCTS. In that context, I am prepared to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am therefore trying to do in practice what as a Minister I sought to promote in theory. My practical experience is not directly relevant to any of the questions that I shall ask.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>495</span>
The clause seeks to correct the faulty drafting of amendments to the operation of the EIS that were introduced last year and to bring the law into line with the Government's intentions in changing the rules. Last year, the Government relaxed the provision that, for a holding company of a group of companies to qualify for EIS, all the subsidiary companies, with all the investments of that holding company, had to be at least 90 per cent. subsidiaries and introduced the sensible concept that the 90 per cent, rule would apply only to the subsidiaries of a holding company that used the money raised under the EIS. In other words, the test for qualification would be applied only to the companies that were to use the money raised. The Government introduced the lower threshold of a 75 per cent. qualification for subsidiaries of a holding company where money raised under the EIS was not to be applied for commercial purposes. That is my understanding of the purpose of last year's amendment, as clarified by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question for whichever Minister replies to the debate is, if we allow the principle that we distinguish between one set of a holding company's subsidiaries and another and apply the test to the subsidiaries that will use the money raised under the EIS, what is the policy principle that requires other subsidiaries of a holding company, which will not benefit from money raised by the EIS, to be held in at least a 75 per cent. proportion by the holding company? I ask that because earlier this year the Government issued a consultative document on corporate venturing. The effect of the provision would be that no EIS holding company could become a corporate venturer, in the sense in which that term is used in the Government's consultative document. Under that document, qualification for corporate venturing relief, as proposed in next year's Finance Bill, would require a maximum holding in the investing company of 20 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government require an EIS-qualifying holding company to have at least 75 per cent. of all its subsidiaries while, wearing a different hat, encouraging corporate venturing with a maximum investment of 20 per cent. In introducing the principle of distinguishing between the different subsidiaries of an EIS-qualifying holding company—I understand why they want 90 per cent. for the company where the money is to be applied—what is the Government's policy principle that requires a 75 per cent. threshold in the rest of the group? Why do the Government want to impose the 75 per cent. threshold while, under another hat, busily promoting the idea that it might be useful for companies to have 20 per cent. or even less as part of a corporate venturing initiative?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the amendment. My right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) says that he understands why the Government wish to reverse last year's Budget and move the threshold from 75 to 90 per cent. I do not often disagree with my right hon. Friend, but I am not entirely clear why the Government want that change from 75 to 90 per cent. Will the Financial Secretary refresh our memories as to why 75 per cent. was chosen previously? Ministers usually receive copious advice before Finance Bills are introduced, with the Inland Revenue giving
	<span class='label label-info column'>496</span>
reasoned arguments explaining why a particular number is recommended. That must have happened with last year's Bill. Equally, there must have been a recommendation to move from 75 to 90 per cent. in this year's Bill. Why has the figure changed from 75 to 90. Why was 90 chosen as the optimum percentage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The enterprise investment scheme, to which clause 64 relates, is now becoming hugely complicated. It is supposed to be about enterprise, initiative, investment and venture capital, yet we find that the relief provisions now encompass 50 pages and 24 sections of tax law. Will the Financial Secretary say how the EIS has been performing since 1997? How will the proposed changes improve the operation of what should be an effort to attach highly entrepreneurial capital, which understands risk-taking and can take advantage of the tax relief to aid the development of an embryo company? There is strong evidence that such complexity is driving "risky" investment to less complex tax areas. Will the Financial Secretary give a commentary on the proposals to help us to understand whether they will boost the performance of the scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause amends one of the rules of the enterprise investment scheme which applies when a company raises money for use by a subsidiary. The right hon. Members for Charnwood and for Fylde (Mr. Jack) raised some interesting points. The effect of the clause is to ensure that tax relief is available to investors only if at least 90 per cent. of the subsidiary is owned by the EIS company, or one of its other subsidiaries. Last year, the Government rationalised the enterprise investment scheme and capital gains reinvestment relief to create a unified scheme that provides better targeted incentives and preserves the best of both schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the changes was to provide more flexibility for company groups by relaxing the general ownership conditions for subsidiaries from 90 per cent. to 75 per cent. The 90 per cent, rule has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced by the Finance Act 1994. To ensure that the EIS remained properly targeted, it was our intention to retain a 90 per cent. test for the subsidiary for which money on which EIS investors had received tax relief was used. Unfortunately, the legislation was defective, so we took the opportunity in this Finance Bill to correct it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for reminding us of the 1994 origins of the 90 per cent. figure. Ministers must have received a recommendation to move from 90 per cent. to 75 per cent to improve flexibility, which the Financial Secretary mentioned. Will she tease out in a little more detail where that policy intention went wrong, how 75 per cent. proved to be incorrect, and why we had to return to the figure of 90 per cent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman speaks as if that were a new policy decision. It is not. I have already explained that there was a defect in last year's legislation, which we want to correct now; that is not a change of policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change takes effect for shares issued on or after 6 April 1999, and aligns the EIS rules with those for

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be clear about the position regarding the 75 per cent. and the 90 per cent. because, with respect, the Financial Secretary's answer to my right hon. Friend was not entirely clear. My understanding is that the Government intend that the 90 per cent. rule should continue to apply to subsidiaries that benefit from funds raised under the enterprise investment scheme, but that the 75 per cent. rule should apply to the rest of a group, where the holding group qualifies under the EIS, so that it applies to members of the group that do not benefit from money raised under the scheme. Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is correct. I obviously misunderstood the right hon. Gentleman. I thought that I saw him nodding in agreement with my reply to his right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Financial Secretary moves on to answer other questions, as she said that the figure of 75 per cent. introduced in the previous Finance Bill was "defective", will she explain why it was defective, especially in the light of the fact that it was introduced to give more flexibility? I do not understand why the change was made in the first place, or why we are now having to go back in the opposite direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not. I have tried to explain to the right hon. Gentleman that our intention last year was perfectly clear. As he knows, both because he was a Treasury Minister himself and because he will have heard me say so in relation to other clauses, we have sought to correct defects in Finance Bills introduced under the Conservative Administration. There was a defect in the existing legislation that we sought to put right, but there has been no policy change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EIS is intended for use by small growing high-risk trading companies, and the rules for groups need to be sufficiently tightly drawn to prevent generous tax reliefs from being obtained by investors whose risk is insufficiently great. One way in which risk can be diminished is for subsidiaries of the company to be substantially owned by another company—perhaps a large asset-backed concern—and the 75 per cent. requirement offers a reasonable measure of protection. Of course, there is nothing to prevent an EIS company from acquiring other subsidiaries once the three-year qualifying period has come to an end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Fylde appropriately asked about the success of the scheme. Since the scheme was introduced, about £230 million has been invested in almost 2,000 companies, with an average investment per company of about £120,000 and an average investment
	<span class='label label-info column'>498</span>
size of a little less than £7,000. This is an important clause, and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I return to my point about the crossover between the enterprise investment scheme and the Government's welcome ideas on corporate venturing? It seems odd that tax relief should be given to entrepreneurial, growth-oriented, high-risk companies—beneficiary companies in the enterprise investment scheme are defined in a variety of different ways—when the definition of that group consciously excludes enterprise investment scheme companies from following through the Government's ideas on corporate venturing. When the Financial Secretary considers the future structure of the corporate venturing scheme, will she ensure that she considers the read-across between the EIS and her corporate venturing ideas? Will she recognise that it will be an odd state of affairs if high-risk entrepreneurial companies are excluded from the corporate venturing initiative, which the Government are keen to promote, and which is a good idea?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the right hon. Gentleman's point and welcome his remarks about corporate venturing. I am a great enthusiast for corporate venturing, and would be interested to hear his comments on the subject, either in the Committee or outside. The consultation period for the corporate venturing proposal—I hope that I have not got this wrong—ends on Friday. I would encourage all Committee members with an interest in the matter to make their contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Corporate venturing is a different approach that encourages companies to invest in smaller independent companies, while the EIS is designed to allow small companies to raise equity finance. The right hon. Gentleman will be familiar with the perennial problem that smaller companies experience in raising equity finance. It is not a new problem; it has been around for many years, and was first spoken about in the 1940s. The right hon. Gentleman will be interested to know that it was called the Macmillan gap, before the 1945 Labour Government rose to the challenge and introduced proposals that led to the establishment of 3i. The 1945 Government was far-sighted.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an intriguing clause. It adjusts the enterprise investment scheme to take into account both the interaction between the scheme and those who wish to move their capital from one scheme to another within it, and the effects of such capital movements if they were affected by the new tapered capital gains tax arrangements.

I shall use the opportunity of this discussion to refresh the Financial Secretary's memory about what, in a debate in the Finance Bill Committee on 12 March 1996, I said about tapered reliefs for capital gains tax. I counselled right hon. and hon. Members on that Committee about the complexities that their new clauses on tapered capital gains tax relief would introduce, and the impact that that would have on investment decisions. I pointed out the distortions that tapered systems could introduce, saying that
	<br><blockquote><p>"people would have one eye on the taper and one eye on the investment opportunity."—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 12 March 1996; c. 820.]</p></blockquote>
It is interesting that the source that assisted me in formulating what I thought to be my perceptive comments on the matter seems to be the same source that has now tempted advisers to recommend an alternative system—the tapered system—whose impact on the enterprise investment scheme the clause seeks to adjust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It intrigues me that at the heart of clause 65 is a recognition that short-term investment can somehow be virtuous. If one were in an enterprise investment scheme for three or four years, for example, one could move on to a new EIS as part of a seamless web, in which the operation of the taper was welded together, by virtue of clause 65, as if the investment were continuous. It is bizarre that investment in enterprise investment schemes has been singled out for special treatment to insulate it against the effect of the tapered capital gains tax arrangements, when no other form of investment appears to be so affected. Why have the Government identified the need for such special treatment for enterprise investment schemes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the general marketplace, if one were to invest in a risky venture on the alternative investment market, and then decide to move one's capital to a new issue, one would be subject to the effects of the tapered arrangements on the previous investment. There would therefore be a potential loss of capital into a new investment. That is not catered for in the clause. I would like the Financial Secretary to convince me, as a first shot, that the clause should stand part of the Bill. Why do the Government propose special treatment for enterprise investment schemes in relation to tapered tax arrangements, yet fail to recognise that short-term investment—moving money to new opportunities, generating new investment—in other sectors of the capital market should qualify for the type of relief proposed in the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course the right hon. Gentleman's speeches remain with me constantly. I must apologise for the fact that the Whitsun recess has made me neglect to read them in great detail. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> As the right hon. Member for Charnwood says, I must unaccountably have left them behind in my rush to get to the Committee. However, I understand the spirit in which the right hon. Member for Fylde made his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 65 introduces a new capital gains tax relief that will encourage successful entrepreneurs to make serial investments through the enterprise investment scheme. The new relief provides for the capital gains tax taper to operate cumulatively where a chargeable gain arising on the disposal of enterprise investment scheme shares is
	<span class='label label-info column'>500</span>
postponed because it is reinvested in a second EIS company. When the shares in the second company are disposed of, the postponed gain is revived. Under the current rules, the revived gain will benefit from taper relief only in respect of the period for which the first shares were held. Under the new rules, the period for which the second shares were held will also be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure will benefit an entrepreneur who wants to realise the gain from a medium-term investment in a small higher-risk trading company and reinvest it in a similar company. The generous business assets taper will apply to the gain if the investor's shareholdings in both companies qualify as business assets. No longer can it be said that CGT acts as a barrier to reinvestment in those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Financial Secretary explain why the principle of allowing the taper clock to continue to tick for serial investments applies only if the first investment is in an EIS qualifying company? Why should it not apply if someone removes money from a floated company and puts it into an EIS qualifying company?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman will know, because he drafted some of the original legislation, that to encourage the important activity of high-risk entrepreneurial companies, we have tried to use similar rules so that legislation is less complex. We have also to target properly what is a generous relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that this helpful boost to the scheme will encourage outside investors in EIS companies who do not qualify for CGT exemptions on the whole of their gains to reinvest the non-exempt amount in other EIS companies. The new reliefs, which build on last year's fundamental reforms to CGT and venture capital reliefs, have been welcomed by EIS practitioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Fylde mentioned complexity. Our priority was to restructure the CGT system so that it would encourage long-term investment, especially entrepreneurial investment, and produce a fairer system. As the complicating features of frozen indexation work their way out of the system, a simplification of CGT for individuals will become evident. Our carefully designed improvement to EIS addresses a problem that is specific to entrepreneurial investments in companies that can benefit from the scheme. The cumulative taper does not accelerate relief. The maximum benefit can be obtained only if the effective holding period is at least 10 years. I hope that the Committee will welcome the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the Financial Secretary has given an unsatisfactory reply. She carefully read out the prepared text, which gave us a technical description of what clause 65 is about. If I were a practitioner, I would support the clause because I would recognise that the impact of the tax taper arrangements on the EIS has been a problem. I cannot disagree in principle. However, the Financial Secretary failed to engage in the debate. She said that the fundamental reforms to the CGT system were designed to stimulate long-term investment, but she
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>501</span>
also said that this measure was designed to encourage shorter or medium-term investment in riskier activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is intriguing that the Financial Secretary is unwilling to engage in a debate in Committee, although tacitly, in clause 65, she recognises that short or medium-term investment is a good thing because she wants to encourage short or medium-term capital movement from one EIS project to another. However, if I chose to invest in the same type of investment but without using the EIS scheme, I would be subject to existing taper arrangements. The Financial Secretary recognises the benefit of short and medium-term investment within the EIS and seeks to relieve it of the burden of the taper. Why will an investment of the same type, made outside the scheme remain subject to the taper arrangements, even if it adopts the characteristics that she described?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my right hon. Friend. The Financial Secretary said that I had been responsible for drafting associated legislation, but I would not claim responsibility for drafting any legislation. Still less would I acknowledge responsibility for the taper system for capital gains tax, because that was not a sensible development. Some of the problems associated with the EIS system illustrate how the Government have made the capital gains tax system, which was enough of an obstruction to an efficient capital market to begin with, even more of an obstruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Financial Secretary why the principle of allowing the taper relief clock to tick for serial entrepreneurs within the EIS sector should not also apply to potential recruits to the sector who have invested in companies that do not qualify under EIS, particularly floated quoted companies. I hope that she will reflect on that. She said that she wanted to avoid unnecessary complexity, which was not a bad response on the spur of the moment, and I do not expect her to provide a considered answer here and now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in considering further refinements to the enterprise investment scheme and ways in which the British venture capital market can be further promoted, the hon. Lady should recognise that easing the flow of money from the floated quoted company sector into the venture capital sector would be a sensible policy objective. One way to do that would be to apply the principle of serial taper relief, which the clause and the associated schedule will introduce, to money flowing from the quoted company sector into the enterprise investment scheme. Where an investor who does not qualify for enterprise investment scheme CGT relief benefits from taper relief through investing in three enterprise investment schemes, one of those investments, preferably the first one, should be in a quoted company, so that money is attracted away from relatively safe investments towards the high-risk, high-growth sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>APPLICATION OF TAPER RELIEF TO EIS DEFERRED GAINS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 185, in page 109, line 32, leave out from "which" to end of line 34 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"the conditions for deferral relief or relief under Chapter III of Part VII of the Taxes Act (EIS income tax relief), or both, apply;".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) This Schedule shall be deemed always to have applied.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment takes further our discussion of clause 65. One of the Financial Secretary's problems is that although she has failed to respond to the points made during the debate on a paving clause for the schedule, we can return to them when we debate the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As ever with Opposition amendments, the purpose of amendment No. 185 is not to produce perfect prose that might have flowed from the skilled pen of the parliamentary draftsman, but to probe the Financial Secretary on the meaning of the word, "attributable" in paragraph 1(1)(a) of new schedule 5BA to the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. Schedule 7 covers the circumstances in which investors, qualify for the taper relief that we have been discussing, and paragraph 1(1)(a) of the suggested schedule 5BA to the 1992 Act states that to qualify, the gain must be one
	<br><blockquote><p>"to which deferral relief or"</p></blockquote>
income tax relief
	<br><blockquote><p>"or both, is attributable".</p></blockquote>
The Chartered Institute of Taxation believes that "attributable" means that the relief must have been claimed. Will the Financial Secretary clarify whether that understanding is correct? To qualify for taper relief, is it necessary for the investor to have claimed either or both of those reliefs, or is it sufficient for the investment to have qualified?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not sensible to have a provision requiring investment reliefs to have been claimed. Someone may not claim one or other of the reliefs. He may forget about them, or may have other reasons for not claiming them. The question is whether the investment qualifies. Will the Financial Secretary clarify whether "attributable" means that it is sufficient for it to qualify, or whether the relief must have been claimed? If the Chartered Institute of Taxation is correct in its understanding that the relief must have been claimed, what is the public policy reason for that insistence? I cannot see one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 186 is simpler and would introduce a phrase that I was concerned about when I first read it, because it is one that I always approach cautiously. As a Minister, I was often asked to move amendments to Bills, and even to draft clauses of Bills, stating that the law was as it had always been thought to be—or, as in the amendment, that a schedule
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be deemed always to have applied."</p></blockquote>
That is a dangerous principle to write into tax law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>503</span>
However, the purpose of the amendment is simply to probe the Government on why the schedule applies only if the original shares were issued on or before 6 April 1998 and disposed of on or after 6 April 1999. What is the reason for that tight definition, and why can the principle of token relief not be written in as something that was intended from the beginning of the Government's new taper relief policy for capital gains tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I liked the right hon. Gentleman's introductory remarks about the wording of the amendment. He was getting his retaliation, or perhaps mitigation, in first—but I shall not criticise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 185 would provide that an investor who realises a gain on disposing of shares in an EIS qualifying company should not be prevented from qualifying for the new cumulative taper relief provisions simply because he did not obtain any EIS relief for those shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an investment in shares is to qualify for the EIS, a number of conditions must be satisfied, as the right hon. Gentleman will know. Some relate to the shares, others to the company and the rest to the investor. Many of them must be satisfied throughout specified periods determined by the date on which the shares were issued. It is not difficult to appreciate that it would in most cases be a practical impossibility to establish—possibly years after the event—that an investor who did not claim relief would have been entitled to claim it and would not subsequently have ceased to be eligible for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, amendment No. 185 would fail in its objective because it suffers from a number of defects. In particular, it targets only those conditions that have to be met in relation to the shares; that ignores all the conditions that have to be met in relation to the company and the investor, but which are not specified in terms of the shares. Those are all included in the EIS. The amendment would therefore allow, for example, a gain on shares to qualify for the cumulative taper where the investor did not claim income tax relief; if he had done so, it would been withdrawn in full because he received value from the company equal in amount to the amount he invested. That would frustrate the aim of the new cumulative taper relief, which is to reward people who make successive higher-risk investments in qualifying companies. The hon. Gentleman asked what it means to say that relief is attributable to shares; it means that deferral relief or income tax relief has been obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 186 would give retrospective effect to the new EIS cumulative taper relief provisions. I appreciate why that might be superficially attractive, but there are good reasons why the commencement provisions are as they are—I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for what he described as a probing amendment, which gives me the opportunity to explain them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for restricting the new relief to cases where the shares in the first company were issued on or after 6 April 1998 is that that is the date from which the EIS and capital gains tax reinvestment relief were brought together in a single unified scheme. Prior to unification,
	<span class='label label-info column'>504</span>
deferral relief was available under the EIS only for investments where income tax relief was also obtained, and in most cases the gains arising on such investments will be exempt from CGT. Following unification, EIS deferral relief is available in a much wider set of circumstances: income tax relief does not have to be claimed for deferral relief to be obtained. In many of those circumstances, a gain arising on the disposal of the EIS shares will not be exempt, and the new cumulative taper relief will be of real benefit. In addition, it would not have been feasible to extend the cumulative taper relief provisions to reinvestment relief shares because reinvestment relief operated on the roll-over principle, making it impracticable to separate the gain arising on the shares from the gain that was rolled over on their acquisition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any case, we felt that, given that there can be few cases of anyone obtaining deferral relief for an investment made on or after 6 April 1998 that is disposed of within a year, the case for making the changes introduced by the schedule retrospective is not strong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the arguments of the Financial Secretary quite persuasive, but could she explain why paragraph (2) states that shares must be
	<br><blockquote><p>"disposed of on or after 6th April 1999"?</p></blockquote>
The Financial Secretary has explained the significance of 6 April 1998 as the start date, but why must the shares have been held for a year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because that is in the nature of the scheme's introduction and that is the date on which we fixed it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary has just used a phrase that has left me blinking slightly.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall ask the Committee's leave to withdraw the amendments, which were tabled to probe the Government's intentions. We know why shares have to be acquired on or after 6 April 1998, but I do not understand why the Government can fix the date in such a way as to require taxpayers to hold them for a year. That
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>505</span>
is avowedly allowing serial entrepreneurs to benefit from the clock not stopping—to use simple English—under taper relief. I do not understand why the first investment in that period, and at no later time, has to have been for a minimum of 12 months. No doubt the Financial Secretary will be asked questions on other occasions, and no doubt she will produce a circumlocution that dresses up the answer that she gave in an indiscreet moment when she said that she had "fixed it".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the more general problem of the rules of qualification for taper relief, the Financial Secretary said that it would be unnecessarily and unworkably complicated to inquire about the origins of a shareholding and whether, when it was acquired, it would have qualified for relief, even though the taxpayer did not claim at the time. I am not sure that I accept that ruling. I understand why it might make life a little easier for the Inland Revenue, but capital gains tax repeatedly comes up against the problem that the tax charged at the time of disposal is determined by a series of factors, many of which are often in the dim and distant past. If it is deemed that the capital gains tax system is unworkable if one has to go back into a taxpayer's history, we would have to conclude that the whole capital gains tax system is unworkable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, however, is an issue for another day. I do not believe that the Financial Secretary has made a compelling case against the principle that I enunciated, but none the less, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CONCESSIONS THAT DEFER A CAPITAL GAINS CHARGE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 188, in page 41, leave out lines 16 to 18 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(9) In this section 'concession' means: Extra Statutory Concessions D15, D16, D22, D23, D24, D25, D32 and D39.".</p></blockquote>
The clause will stop a possible injustice whereby a taxpayer claims the benefit of a non-statutory concession that defers capital gains charge, but insists on the strict statutory basis when that gain finally crystallises. We support the clause, but are worried about the uncertainties created by how it is drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New section 284A(9) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 states that a
	<br><blockquote><p>"'concession' includes any practice, interpretation or other statement in the nature of a concession."</p></blockquote>
That is far too wide a definition. What does an "interpretation" comprise? The Law Society is also worried about the phrase. Its representation says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"practices, interpretations or other statements in the nature of a concession could take a wide variety of forms, and may not be readily accessible or comprehensible. In order to avoid uncertainty, we urge that the ambit of the legislation is restricted to published extra statutory concessions and statements of practice".</p></blockquote>
Moreover, when statutes refer to secondary, or, in this case, tertiary, legislation, the references should be to a comprehensive list, not to a body of tertiary or secondary legislation in general. Previous Bills that the Government have introduced refer to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any statutory instruments that may be affected by this Bill."</p></blockquote>
Such phrases are not acceptable. Anxiety has been expressed, both outside and in the House, about the growing bodies of secondary and tertiary legislation. In many ways, all legislation should be primary legislation if it is going to be obeyed and we are deemed to have to obey it. When there are practical necessities for including legislation in statutory instruments or by extra-statutory statements, and we are trying to amend such laws, they should be referred to comprehensively. People should not be expected to know where to find such obscure legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 188 specifies all the possible extra-statutory concessions that are likely to be involved. It cuts out the vagaries of the word "interpretation" by removing it from the new subsection, and helps to give the measure certainty and clarity. Extra-statutory concession D15 allows business asset rollover relief for unincorporated associations; D16 allows it in repurchasing an old asset; D22 allows it where proceeds are used to improve or enhance an existing asset; D23 refers to partnership assets; D24 allows rollover relief in cases of delay while improvements are carried out; D25 allows business asset rollover relief on a further interest in an existing asset; D32 allows relief on incorporation of a business; D39 concerns the surrender of a lease.

Will the Financial Secretary clarify a point made by several organisations in relation to an error or mistake claim under section 33 or 33 A of the Taxes Management Act 1970? The clause applies only to disposals after

	<span class='label label-info column'>507</span>
9 March 1999. What is the situation for taxpayers who made a disposal before that date, benefited from one of the concessions on an earlier disposal and abided by its terms on a later disposal? Had they insisted on the strict statutory basis, they could have paid less tax. What is to prevent them from submitting an error or mistake claim now to undo that arrangement? The legislation amounts to a tacit acceptance by the Government of the existing position. That is the subject of a tax bulletin article by the Inland Revenue, but it would help the Committee if the Financial Secretary would spell out the details of the situation as she sees it, and the statutory basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the clause is to prevent the abuse of any published concession that would relieve a capital gain in one year and charge it in a later year. I am sure that when the hon. Gentleman has had the opportunity to consider the matter, he will see his wrongdoing, as the amendment would frustrate that purpose by restricting the application of the clause to certain concessions included in Inland Revenue booklet IR1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is unacceptable. I cannot believe that Opposition Members, by ensuring that the clause applies only to certain specified concessions and not to all such published capital gains concessions, are prepared to allow taxpayers to act in bad faith by avoiding tax that they ought to pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment sets out eight extra-statutory concessions to which the clause could apply.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have the opportunity to do so. An example of what the amendment leaves out is extra-statutory concession D26, a rollover relief concession. Opposition Members have not properly thought out the consequences of their amendments, tabled on important issues, concerning which some taxpayers act in bad faith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why can the Financial Secretary not include that extra-statutory concession in the list if she feels that it ought to be included? The clause refers to published extra-statutory concessions. They are all published, but are obscured from taxpayers. They should be in the legislation. With all the resources at her disposal, why can she not include every extra-statutory concession in the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no good the hon. Gentleman producing that small fig leaf to cover his embarrassment. He needs to think about the consequences of his amendment. For example, it does not cover any statement of practice, and some of those are acknowledged to contain concessionary elements. It is essential to cover any of those that can defer a capital gains charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to published extra-statutory concessions and statements of practice, guidance set out in the published Inland Revenue capital gains manual or in articles in the Revenue's tax bulletin could constitute a concession in certain circumstances. We do not want taxpayers to take advantage of that and avoid tax by
	<span class='label label-info column'>508</span>
refusing to return a deferred gain. Because such concessions can permeate another practice or interpretation, it would not be sensible or practical to attempt to list them all in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that it is right for the clause to cover all such concessions in whatever form they are published. The only way to ensure to that that is done is to define them in an appropriate generic way. If the hon.

Gentleman asked whether the Revenue would have to repay any tax paid on gains deferred under a concession. The answer is no. Tax could be repaid on an assessment that had become final only if an error or mistake claim by the taxpayer were admitted. The Inland Revenue tells me that such a claim is unlikely to succeed. It will comment on that matter in its published guidance when the Bill is enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That response is totally inadequate. Taxpayers can make an error or mistake claim under section 33 of the Taxes Management Act 1970. It is unacceptable to ask the Committee to agree to the clause for now, and then wait for the statement in the Inland Revenue's tax bulletin. Will the Financial Secretary tell us the contents of that tax bulletin article today, so that members of the Committee can have the benefit of that advice before deciding how to react to the clause? This is not the first time that Ministers have taken an approach in which they temper broadly drafted legislation with statements from the Executive. We are meant to rely on those statements when deciding how to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary refuses to incorporate extra-statutory concession D39—the eighth referred to in the amendment—into the clause because I have not included concession D26. However, only four examples—D15, D16, D22 and D39—are set out in the explanatory notes. It is intolerable to expect taxpayers to have an exhaustive understanding of all the concessions to which the clause relates. The Government are not prepared, either in the explanatory notes or in debate in Committee, to give an exhaustive list of the extra-statutory concessions and statements of practice to which the clause relates, for the benefit of taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the Government, with all their resources, say that they cannot provide such an exhaustive list? It is unacceptable that taxpayers, struggling to obey the law with few resources, will not be given the benefit of such a list. The Financial Secretary's responses to both issues raised by the amendment are unacceptable, and I wait to hear what she now has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

understand?" I have already explained the Revenue position. I have told the hon. Gentleman why the amendment is defective: it would give succour to the small number of taxpayers who act in bad faith.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, that is a totally unsatisfactory response. Section 33 of the Taxes Management Act makes it quite clear that taxpayers can submit an error or mistake claim. If I am wrong, I should like to be told so; but no response has been made to that point. The Financial Secretary said merely that the Inland Revenue would not accept such a claim, but she gave no statutory basis for its being refused, which is what I asked for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady relied on the fact that the Inland Revenue will, at some future date, publish a tax bulletin saying why it will refuse error or mistake claims. I want to know today what that reason is. As a Member of Parliament and as spokesman for the official Opposition, I do not understand why I should not he given that explanation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory (Wells)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 189, in page 42, line 19, leave out "2000" and insert "2004".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause and the amendment deal with business investment. The background is rather serious, because business investment has more or less collapsed under the present Government. They were the lucky beneficiaries of the golden economic legacy to which we referred in
	<span class='label label-info column'>510</span>
previous debates. An important part of that legacy was the fact that business investment was extremely buoyant and was underpinning the manufacturing and industrial success that the United Kingdom was enjoying. Unfortunately, all that has now been put at risk. Recent economic developments are no longer underpinned by a healthy investment performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For confirmation of that we turn to an uncharacteristically candid section of the Budget report. On page 140, the Government admit that
	<br><blockquote><p>"rapid growth in total business investment, averaging 8¾ per cent. a year"</p></blockquote>
occurred
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the three years to 1997".</p></blockquote>
Since then there has been a steep decline, and the report goes on to state that
	<br><blockquote><p>"indicators of confidence, profits and capacity utilisation fell quite markedly in the second half of 1998."</p></blockquote>
In contrast to the 8¾ per cent, a year performance in the last years of the previous Government, the Red Book forecasts a growth in business investment of only 1 to 1 % per cent, for 1999. I would describe that as a collapse. If one adds Government and housing investment, the total just reaches 2 to 2½ per cent., compared to an 8 per cent. performance in the previous year. There is a serious prospect of business investment facing a steep decline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's only response is to extend for a further year the first-year capital allowances, which they increased from the usual 25 per cent. in their first Budget in 1997. In the 1998 Budget, they extended that advantage for a further year. They are now doing so again, so that firms investing for a further year can obtain the accelerated tax allowances. That is not an overall benefit; it is a timing issue, which means that firms will be able to write off their business investments for tax purposes rather sooner. That is evidently designed to encourage firms to bring forward their investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trouble is that no one believes the Government's views and policies on business any more. People have been let down too often. When the Government talk about a business-friendly environment to promote investment, it rings just as hollow as their claim to have created a low-tax environment for business. Firms know that the cost of transporting their goods has risen, through the action of the indirect tax escalator, making them uncompetitive in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Businesses have seen that, although the Government talk about the need for flexibility, they have worked in the opposite direction in relation to the purchase and sale of business assets such as buildings, which are now caught by a higher rate of stamp duty. Firms have heard Government talk about a lower corporation tax rate, but they know that the corporation tax payable has gone up, and is forecast to rise by £2 billion a year during this Parliament. As usual, the Government are saying one thing and doing another. That is why businesses do not trust what the Government are saying about investment policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are the Government extending for a further year the concessions on capital allowances, rather than
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>511</span>
establishing a permanent regime for more favourable treatment of investment, if that is what they are pretending to do? Until now, they have effectively penalised firms that believed what the Government said when they announced a year's extension of capital allowance advantages. Those firms brought forward investments that they would not have otherwise undertaken because they believed that the concession would end, as was announced in previous Budgets. The Government then extended the concession by a further year, which validated the views of more cynical business men who believed that the one-year extension was something of a gimmick. However, when the Government did it again, businesses were entitled to suppose that the whole thing was a gimmick to encourage investment and dress up the national investment figures as a substitute for really establishing a low-tax, light-regulation regime, which is something that the Government talk about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In replying to the debate, perhaps the Minister will explain the underlying philosophy of the tax structure as it affects investment, and say whether this really will be the end of annual extensions, or whether, in due course, businesses will find that they have been betrayed yet again and need not have brought forward their investment plans to benefit from the lighter tax incentive. The Government are undermining the aim of the policy, which is to create more business investment, by leading those businesses up the garden path with annual extensions. I tabled the amendment as a probing amendment, but it requires a considered and detailed response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the enhanced first-year allowances because they will provide benefits for industry and stimulate investment. However, I share the concerns of the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) regarding the philosophy behind the Government's approach to tax policy for the corporate sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other debates, my hon. Friends and I have criticised the Government's approach in other areas of the tax system where they have increased complexity. In this part of the tax system, they seem to be introducing instability and uncertainly. When one is talking about investment, that is the last thing that companies need. Indeed, the Government seem to have grasped that point on macro-economic policy: we hear ad nauseam about their desire to end boom and bust. They are right to take that approach to macro-economic policy. They are right to have introduced the independent central bank. However, they seem to be introducing boom and bust into the corporate tax system by not telling companies what the investment tax regime will be in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an argument for one-off tax changes, for a short and determined period, if the Government believe, and there is evidence to suggest, that the circumstances warrant it; if, for example, there is a deep recession and the Government believe that such an allowance would bring forward investment to help the economy out of recession—a sort of counter-cyclical tax measure. However, the argument for a series of such measures is not strong. As the right hon. Gentleman said, there is lack of clarity in the future direction of the corporate tax
	<span class='label label-info column'>512</span>
system, which also means that such measures will become less and less effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult for some companies to bring forward investment to fit in with the time scales set down by such measures—difficult because some of the most strategic investments that they need to make for the future of their companies, take a long time to plan. They involve other companies and major investment changes that might not fit in with the one-off, 12-month approach that the Government prefer. Some investment may be stimulated, but it will not be the most essential investment. The quality of investment by British industry may decline, which will have significant implications for its competitiveness. Quality and quantity of investment are important. We do not want British industry to invest in ventures merely because it is desperate to reduce its tax burden for a particular year. We want British industry to choose investments that will give it and its shareholders the best return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure is short termist. It is good that it will return money to the business sector—that is sorely needed—but British business will not welcome a series of short-term measures as a tenet of the Government's tax policy. The Government must decide either not to introduce the measures or, as the right hon. Member for Wells said, to make them permanent. A third way, if there is one, would be unprincipled and ineffective, and would militate against sensible long-term investment planning decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one is against giving extra money to British industry. It needs it desperately, especially the manufacturing sector, which is, as the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, struggling with the effects of the strong pound. The Government must tell industry what their philosophy is and reassure it that they will provide the corporate sector with a stable, secure and certain approach to the Corporate tax system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Listening to the right hon. Member for Wells, I wondered whether I was living in a parallel universe. I did not recognise his description of the state of industry, especially small businesses, under the previous Administration. The phrase, "It's life Captain, but not as we know it", came to mind. It sums up my incredulity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting to hear the right hon. Gentleman praise the previous Government, with whom he was so pleased that he decided to resign.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The reality is that a small business went bust every three minutes under the previous Conservative Government. They had an appalling record of neglect of our small and medium-sized enterprises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to note that the amendment endorses first-year allowances. The right hon. Member for Wells neglected to tell us that in 1984 the then Chancellor, now Lord Lawson, phased out first-year allowances. He obviously did not want to mention that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>513</span>
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would make first-year capital allowances for small and medium-sized businesses available for an extra four years above the one-year extension in clause 69. The Government believe that it is right to encourage growth and investment among smaller businesses, but do not agree that the extension is a cost-effective way of doing so. I welcome the remarks made by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) on the Government's policies to help small and medium-sized businesses. It is important to create the right conditions for such businesses to grow and invest. That depends not on any single instrument, but on the combined effect of the Government operating all available levers at the right time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we took office in 1997, we introduced first-year allowances for small and medium-sized enterprises at 50 per cent, as a temporary one-year measure to help ease cash flow on investment. Taking all economic factors into account, we judged it right to extend those allowances for a further year in 1998 at a reduced rate of 40 per cent. Given the difficulties that the small manufacturing sector has experienced, we believe it right to extend the allowances for a further year at the same rate, which will help such businesses in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since taking office, we have also introduced a wide range of other measures to help small businesses. We have cut 3p off the rate of corporation tax for small companies, introduced a 10p starter rate of corporation tax and reformed CGT to encourage long-term investment. We also plan to introduce a number of other measures that will help small businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday, I visited small businesses in Staffordshire. The owner of one said that he was tremendously encouraged by the steps that the Government are taking not only to help small businesses such as his, but to encourage the entrepreneurial culture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be premature to decide now whether first-year allowances should be extended again next year or during the two subsequent years. We shall need to examine the matter very carefully next year in the light of the state of the economy and all the other measures that we have introduced, or are introducing, to help small businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government came into office, we had to take on the tremendous job of reversing the effects of 18 years of Conservative Government on small and medium-sized businesses. Now, we are promoting those businesses as the engine drivers of our economy. The amendments are premature; they do not take into account the context of other measures and would not further the Government's intentions. The right hon. Member for Wells said that the amendment was a probing amendment, and I ask him to withdraw it. If he will not, I ask my hon. Friends to oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In her reply, the hon. Lady failed to refer to the figures in the Red Book that graphically describe the collapse in business investment. It may be that, less than three months after the Budget,
	<span class='label label-info column'>514</span>
the Government are starting to disown their Budget forecast. I put it to her that the situation described in the Red Book is extremely serious. Given her silence on the matter, I assume that she agrees with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Economic Secretary whether she agreed that the trick of annual extensions to the 40 per cent. first-year allowances was not working. That was the implication behind her own figures, but she side-stepped the question by saying that it would be premature to speculate on whether the Government will do it again. I would advise businesses not to take advantage of the further annual extension of the first-year allowance, because they probably will do it again. That undermines business confidence in what the Government say. It reveals that they have no properly worked out policies or plans for a sustained revival in business investment. That will have serious long-term consequences—but the Financial Secretary has not told us anything new; we already suspected that that was the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unkind to return with further questions that the Financial Secretary cannot answer, so her words must tell the dismal story. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='schedule'>Schedule 10</div> <!-- schedule -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>SHARING OF PENSIONS ETC. ON DIVORCE OR ANNULMENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Tenth schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Hertfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The schedule deals with the tax treatment of pension sharing, which was introduced in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill. It is an improvement to the law, which the Opposition have welcomed, as it enables couples to achieve a clean break while splitting the family's pension provision fairly. It provides an additional and much-needed tool for the courts, and will enable women to be independent of their ex-husbands in old age, by ensuring that they receive their pension whether or not their husbands have died.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern has been expressed about the tax arrangements set out in the schedule. The limit on benefits payable from an occupational pension scheme will remain, and will apply to the pension credit as if the shared pension rights remained with the scheme member. The scheme member who has had pension credits taken from his fund and who may wish to rebuild his rights by buying years and making additional contributions up to his limit will therefore be disadvantaged because the pension credit will remain part of that limit. Equally, in the case of personal pensions—for which contributions are limited—a scheme member who wished to rebuild his rights after
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>515</span>
the transfer of a pension credit out of his fund would be able to do so up to the limits that applied. Prior contributions that counted towards the pension credit rights would, however be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 9 of the explanatory notes suggests that there will be a concession, which I understand will be in respect of defined benefit schemes and occupational pension schemes approved by the Revenue. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For tax approval purposes, this pension debit may be ignored under all types of retirement benefits schemes, when calculating the maximum benefits for a scheme member… who earns not more than ¼ of the earnings cap (£22,650 for 1999/2000). For other retirement benefit scheme members, pension debits will continue to count in the calculation of maximum benefits under the tax approval rules.</p></blockquote>
That concession does not appear to be in the schedule. Why not? Will it be dealt with as a matter of discretion? Will the Financial Secretary explain more fully whether it applies only to occupational pension schemes that require tax approval, or whether it will also apply to personal pensions? Paragraph 15 of the schedule seems to provide little room for the concession to which the explanatory notes refer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its submission the Chartered Institute of Taxation stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We question why an employee will not be allowed to rebuild his pension following divorce."</p></blockquote>
If the concession referred to in the notes is to be in place, a number of questions still arise. First, will it apply to all schemes, including personal pensions and retirement annuity contracts? Secondly, what is the reason for the limit of one quarter of the cap? Is it simply a matter of cost, or does the Treasury have a specific reason for deciding that that is a practical solution?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, it would be more logical if the person receiving the pension credit rights received with those credit rights the contributions limit or the contributions relief. Would it be too complicated to do that, or is there another reason? Perhaps more problems would be created if the ex-spouse already had pension rights and the added contributions on which relief had been given in respect of the pension credit rights took her over the limit. What is the reason?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chartered Institute of Taxation is worried about the rebuilding of pension rights following a pension share. Some solicitors and barristers who work in that area are discussing the matter and wondering whether there is even-handedness between scheme members and ex-spouses. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response to the questions about rebuilding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. Cook, if I draw the attention of the Committee to the charming entry in the published diaries of the former
	<span class='label label-info column'>516</span>
Member for Chester, Gyles Brandreth, which states that on Friday 23 June 1995, when he telephoned the then Prime Minister's campaign team at 13 Cowley street,
	<br><blockquote><p>"An over-excited Bunterish voice answered. "John Major's campaign headquarters." It was Oliver Heald. How on earth has he managed to get his chubby knees under the table so quickly?"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that one should always be careful about trusting a man in a sweater?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seem to recall that when the present Leader of the Opposition took up his post, he took his entire shadow Cabinet away for a bonding weekend, and they were all—including the right hon. Member for Charnwood, who graces this Committee—instructed to wear sweaters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always a pleasure to hear from the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire, (Mr. Heald) and I was pleased to hear his general welcome for the pension-sharing arrangements provided for in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill. Clause 70 enables schedule 10 to back up the pension-sharing provisions in that Bill, by making the necessary changes in the rules relating to the tax approval of occupational pension schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will be pleased to hear that his first question, about the easement for those with moderate earnings who wish to rebuild their pension benefit rights, was also my first question on the subject. The answer is that it is not necessary to include a provision for people earning up to £22,650 in the current year to rebuild their rights. It is unnecessary for that to be included in the schedule because the vast majority of occupational pension schemes are tax-approved under the discretionary powers given to the Board of Inland Revenue in section 591 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. The easement that we announced will be applied to members of schemes meeting the published criteria, and the Inland Revenue will advise on that in the normal way, through practice notes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the smaller number of schemes that meet the criteria of section 590 of the 1988 Act, with which the schedule is concerned, choose the discretionary tax approval route, which offers more generous terms—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
