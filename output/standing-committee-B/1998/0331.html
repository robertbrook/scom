<div class='page-header'><h1>Fur Farming (Prohibition) Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Maria Eagle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Garston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That, during proceedings on the Fur Farming (Prohibition) Bill, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
I thank you, Dr. Clark, for presiding over our deliberations this morning. I have not had the pleasure of presenting a Bill in front of you before—in fact, I have not had the pleasure of presenting a Bill in front of anyone before. I am sure that you will take that into account and be as kind as possible to me, although I am perfectly willing to be guided by your wisdom during our proceedings. It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. My sister, the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle), introduced a Bill in Committee under your chairmanship and I am grateful to you for promising not to tell me which of us did it better.<br><br>
There are a few reasons why our deliberations have become more urgent since Second Reading and why the Committee must proceed quickly. Much was said on Second Reading about animal welfare issues, which are at the heart of the Bill. Several hon. Members who expressed opposition to the Bill suggested that it would be a better to improve animal welfare standards than to move to an outright ban on fur farming. At the time, I thought that it would not be possible to improve welfare standards in intensive farming for animals that are farmed for their fur, which in this country means only mink.<br><br>
Since Second Reading, my fears have been confirmed. One of this country's remaining fur farmers was convicted at Lyndhurst magistrates court on 11 March on 15 counts of cruelly and ordered to pay a £5,000 fine and £15,000 costs. It is the first time that a mink farmer in this country has been found guilty of cruelty, but the disturbing feature is that, despite the appalling conditions to which the animals were subjected on that farm, he was not banned from keeping animals and is continuing to keep them in what one imagines to be similar conditions—I hope that the conditions are not as bad as those found by Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food vets. The case illustrated the inadequacy of the current law and why we must ensure that the Bill becomes law.<br><br>
I have always said that we must be fair to farmers. Those who opposed the Bill on Second Reading said that standards should be improved and that we should not worry too much about putting farmers out of business. However, I have never taken that view. One reason why the remaining fur farmers are unable to improve welfare standards is that conditions in the industry are such that it is not economically viable for them to do so.<br><br>
The fur auction in Copenhagen in March 1999 revealed a drop in the price of mink pelts during the past
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
year of 31.5 per cent. Conditions in the industry are worsening and becoming harder for those few remaining farmers. It would be more sensible for the farmers if we got the Bill on to the statute book, compensated them properly and put an end to fur farming. I hope that we can proceed as quickly and as fairly as possible through the clauses and I commend the sittings motion to the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Hunter <span class='memberconstituency'>(Basingstoke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I repeat and endorse the words of welcome that the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle) expressed to you, Dr. Clark. Your experience and wisdom are widely acknowledged and your fairness is well known. Under your guidance, we can be confident that the Committee's proceedings will be conducted in the highest traditions of Parliament.<br><br>
With your permission, Dr. Clark, I shall make a statement of interests. First, I emphasise that I have no interest or involvement—pecuniary or non-pecuniary—in fur farming, the British Fur Trade Association or anything else to do with fur. There is only one grey area: I am member of the National Farmers Union. I understand that some fur farmers are also members of the National Farmers Union. I understand that the union has been advising fur farmers and I, too, have sought advice on the Bill from the NFU. I do not know whether that amounts to a non-pecuniary interest, but I am not ashamed of the relationship and I wish the Committee to know of it.<br><br>
Secondly, to avoid confusion, I have in the past been actively involved in the affairs of the Country Landowners Association. I am not currently involved, and I do not know whether the association has taken a position on the Bill.<br><br>
Lastly, I am a member of Basingstoke rugby football club, but that is probably wholly irrelevant.<br><br>
It is not the purpose of debates on sittings motions or amendments or of clause stand part debates to provide us with an opportunity to rerun the arguments put forward on Second Reading, except in so far as those arguments are relevant. The principles of the Bill have been agreed by the House, and I accept that. However, I hope that the Committee will acknowledge that I have a principled opposition to the Bill. When that opposition is relevant, I shall refer to it.<br><br>
The Committee will be aware that I have tabled a number of amendments. In debating the sittings motion, we are surely well advised to bear in mind the demands that may be put on the Committee's time. The number of amendments selected is clearly relevant to the number and frequency of the Committee's sittings. I do not know whether further sittings beyond this morning's will be required, but the sittings motion satisfies all possible requirements.<br><br>
In moving the sittings motion, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston made a number of observations, none of which I need answer now because they will all feature in subsequent debates. However, I wish the hon. Lady to know that there is an alternative interpretation to the points that she made about the recent conviction. It can be argued that it shows that regulation does indeed work. It can also be argued that the shortfall in investment that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0662">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
fur fanning may now be suffering is more likely to be due to uncertainty about its future than to any other factor. We shall return to those points in due course. I support the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That, during proceedings on the Fur Farming (Prohibition) Bill, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill; copies are available in the Room. I should also like to remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any starred amendments that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.</span></p>

Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
OFFENCES RELATING TO FUR FARMING</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 1, line 5, leave out "or primarily".<br><br>
In the words of the explanatory notes, subsection (1), which the amendment would amend, will create
<br><blockquote><p>"a primary offence of keeping animals solely or primarily for slaughter for the value of their fur".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph (a) specifies that the offence can be committed by the person who keeps the animals or by another individual. It is immaterial whether the slaughterer is also the keeper of the animals. Paragraph (b) widens the offence to include breeding progeny for such slaughter.<br><br>
The explanatory notes are helpful, but not in the way in which the hon. Member for Garston intends. Indeed, they focus attention on a possible ambiguity without which the Bill would be better.<br><br>
That ambiguity lies in the explanatory notes' clarification of and distinction between the words "solely" and "primarily". Someone who keeps animals partly for slaughter and partly for another purpose, will be guilty of an offence only if the primary purpose is slaughter.<br><br>
I understand that the intention is to ensure that people such as rabbit farmers, who produce and market, or enable others to market, both meat and fur would be guilty of the offence if the value of the fur that they produced was greater than the value of the rabbits' meat. To use the vernacular, that is crazy.<br><br>
I shall elaborate my argument shortly, but subsection (1) is disturbingly defective. The provision as drafted is bound to lead to legal uncertainty. It oversimplifies, in that it does not do justice to the variations in and complexities of rabbit farming—to continue with that example. It will present lawyers with a wonderful opportunity to practise their skills.<br><br>
I do not know whether the hon. Member for Garston has any experience of running her own business. If so, she will understand my point. Rabbit farming is free from price support, market controls and mechanisms and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
is exposed to the vagaries of the market. The value of rabbit meat and fur varies in both absolute and relative terms. At given times, the value of meat and fur produce will rise and fall through the combined operation of supply and demand, both of which can be, and often are, affected by the way in which the same market forces are operating for overseas—mainly European—producers. It follows that it will sometimes be extremely difficult to determine whether the value of the fur that a rabbit farmer produces exceeds or is less than the value of the rabbit meat that he produces.<br><br>
My argument is not abstract or academic but considers the reality of the business of rabbit farming. How will a court reach a conclusion on whether an offence has been committed, when the market for fur and meat is so volatile, especially in cases in which the value of meat and fur that a company produces is broadly approximate for much of the time? At different points in the year, or different moments in the economic cycle, one may be earning more than the other for the company, but the situation may change and change again. How is a court to decide what is the predominant interest of the business and on what date to make that decision? Those are fundamental defects in the subsection.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
The problems do not stop there. To base a definition of primary purpose on the values of the finished products—I emphasise that term—of fur and meat is to take a highly selective view of the value of a business and how it is run. To do so is to concentrate on only the bottom line of the current account, the profitability, and to ignore the dimension of capital investment. Such investment can be out of kilter with the returns on it. The intrinsic value of a business cannot be measured solely by sales values. The explanatory notes, which I acknowledge are not intended to be a comprehensive description of the Bill, make no mention of that dimension. I look forward to the hon. Member for Garston correcting me, if appropriate, but I suspect that she may not have fully considered how to assess the value of a business.<br><br>
With the inclusion in subsection (1) of the words "or primarily", we open up an enormous grey area, without which the Bill would he better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the purpose of the hon. Gentleman's amendment is to clarify the Bill rather than to wreck it, would it not be more appropriate to propose to change "primarily" to, let us say, "to a significant extent"? If "primarily" is removed, it would be easy for fur farmers to devise a secondary purpose to their activities and thereby evade the purpose of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I follow what the hon. Gentleman says, but I do not agree. His suggestion that we use the words "to a significant extent" could make matters even more chaotic than the words "or primarily" will. I ask him to bear with me, as my argument will further and clarify the purpose of the hon. Member for Garston at this point in the Bill. He is welcome to intervene in due course, but I believe that I will answer—to the best of my ability—the points that he made.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0663">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
Amendment No. 10 would restrict the offence to keeping animals for the sole purpose of selling their fur. It would therefore catch mink farmers—there is no secondary use for mink other than their fur—and serve the Bill's purpose. It is far from being a scuppering amendment. It is consistent with the Bill's intentions. It ensures that the Bill does not create a legal uncertainty for rabbit farmers, who are not the target of the Bill. The hon. Member for Garston said on Second Reading:
<br><blockquote><p>"There has been hysteria among some opponents of the Bill who have sought to suggest that it is the thin end of a wedge that will affect a much wider range of farming. That is not my intention. The Bill is not about banning fur as a by-product. It is not intended to bring about, and nor will it, the banning of the use of fur where fur is a by-product of, for example, food production. Where rabbits, for example, are produced for food, the Bill will not prohibit that."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 5 March 1999; Vol. 326, c. 1334.]</p></blockquote>
By her own admission, my amendment is therefore entirely consistent with the hon. Lady's intentions. Moreover, it enhances them. By making the offence applicable to people who keep an animal solely for slaughter for the value of its fur, she catches mink farmers and avoids creating legal uncertainty for rabbit farmers, against whose businesses she rightly has no objection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angela Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Basildon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the amendment is intended to provide an opportunity for clarification. However, does the hon. Gentleman not accept that the amendment would create a great loophole in the Bill—it would drive a coach and horses through it? If we were to accept the amendment, the Bill would prohibit the slaughter of animals solely for their fur, but if there were any by-product, fur farming could continue as at present, because it would be outside the scope of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I invite the hon. Lady to answer her own question by saying that she may have greater, deeper and more extensive knowledge than I have about fur farming, but I am completely unaware of any by-product that has historically come from mink. Therefore, unless I am mistaken and there is a by-product of which I am unaware, deleting the words, "or primarily" would not create a loophole. No by-product comes from mink; they are exclusively farmed for their pelts. If I am mistaken, I invite the hon. Lady to tell me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angela Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make two points. First, do not underestimate the ingenuity of those who wish to continue farming mink for their fur. Secondly, the Bill is not about mink farming; it is about fur farming and can apply to any animal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find the hon. Lady's second point rather thin. None of us is under any illusion about what the Bill is really about. I suspect that, if the hon. Lady and I spent a little time looking through the Second Reading debate, we would find that a significant number of Labour Members and supporters of the Bill either implicitly or explicitly made that point.<br><br>
I justify the amendment on a basis that can be proved or disproved easily. The Minister may comment on this, but over the 70 or 80 years, or whatever, that mink farming has been practised in this country, there has been
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
no commercial by-product. If I am wrong, I will have to rethink the amendment. My intention is not to create a loophole for mink farmers, but to ensure that the Bill will not harm rabbit farmers, whom the hon. Member for Garston said that she did not want to harm.<br><br>
My fear is that if the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) proves that my argument is wrong, we shall be back to square one. We shall expose rabbit farmers to the very danger that the hon. Member for Garston has much emphasised that she wishes not to put them in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I call Maria Eagle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Maria Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Dr. Clark.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry; I thought that the hon. Lady was intervening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So did I.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Have you finished, Mr. Hunter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have probably said enough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Maria Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for any confusion that I have caused. I shall do my best to improve as the sitting continues.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Basingstoke for taking such an interest in the Bill and for tabling what he thinks to be constructive amendments. However, I cannot agree with the analysis that he has set out at length this morning. I hope that he will understand why I must oppose amendment No. 10, and I shall explain why I do so. First, the main purpose of the Bill, which has been approved by the House without Division, is to ban the farming of animals primarily or solely for the commercial value of their fur. Although the Bill covers mink farming, it goes wider than that to include all fur farming. The hon. Member for Basingstoke quoted my words on Second Reading. I made it clear then that the Bill's intention is not to prohibit the production of food, if fur or hide is a by-product. As that has been stated explicitly by the Bill's promoter, I do not expect an enforcer of its provisions to go rushing out after rabbit farmers to bring them within that remit or ambit. I repeat that that is not the intention of the Bill.<br><br>
However, I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Basingstoke that we do not wish to create uncertainty for rabbit farmers. Rabbit is the only example that I can think of that falls within the hon. Gentleman's concern, which is why I made it clear that I am not aiming at food production. I disagree with his interpretation of the clause, although I know that he has referred to the explanatory notes, which are intended to be helpful. A court considering the primary purpose of a commercial undertaking under the Bill's provisions would not necessarily just compare the income from fur with the income from meat, as in the case of rabbit. The hon. Gentleman suggested that, if someone's income from fur suddenly rose above the level of their income from meat, the enforcers from MAFF would descend on him and cart him off to court. That will not happen. I think that the hon. Gentleman is too anxious. It will be a matter for the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
courts to decide the primary purpose of a business that is prosecuted under the legislation. They will approach the matter, as they usually do, with a common-sense view.<br><br>
It is clear that the primary purpose of a mink farm is to collect the commercial value of the furs. There are few obvious other by-products of mink, although there are some. For example, mink oil is found in cosmetics. It is perfectly possible to come up with suggestions of how other bits of the mink might be used, to evade the meaning of "solely", which is what we would be left with if the hon. Gentleman's amendment were accepted. If that happened, the main purpose of the Bill would be prevented from being implemented; it would be defeated by the amendment. I am not suggesting that that is the hon. Gentleman's intention, but it would be the result. Courts will have a common-sense approach to the matter of primary purpose. The income from fur, as opposed to income from other by-products, will be taken into account, but that will not necessarily be the only consideration.<br><br>
I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's view that the Bill, if enacted, will create work for lawyers. Most legislation does, especially legislation that establishes offences. It is certain to make work for lawyers, and I regret that—I have been a lawyer in my time—but it is an unavoidable by-product of legislation. I hope that, on reflection, the hon. Gentleman will realise that if he presses his amendment, it would do much more to defeat the purpose of the Bill, which has been approved by the House, than it would to reassure rabbit farmers. If he does not withdraw his amendment, I shall advise my hon. Friends and colleagues to vote against it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady. The intention of my amendment was not to create a loophole, but to avoid unnecessary and complicated litigation for rabbit farmers. I shall withdraw the amendment, but I hope that the hon. Lady and the Minister will find time between now and Report to give further thought to the phraseology used in the clause. I wonder whether it is beyond the wit of Government man to produce an expression of the Bill's intention that provides greater security for rabbit farmers, whose business is cyclical. It has been agreed that, at different times, the value of meat or of fur may be the greater.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
The hon. Member for Garston made an interesting observation at the beginning of her speech, from which I take good heart. If I understood her correctly, the Bill is not solely about mink farming—although that is the current example. She said that she also had it in mind to prevent any other form of fur farming. What concerns me is that at present, to the best of my knowledge, there is no other form of fur farming in the United Kingdom. She assumes that, should some other form of fur farming emerge, the draconian measure of criminalisation is the way to deal with it.<br><br>
That strengthens my argument that the Bill should be more open and honest in its intentions—not futuristic and vague—and leave open the option to deal with any other fur farming in future by means of regulation.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Clark <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kensington and Chelsea)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely my hon. Friend should realise that that is exactly what underlies the support for this measure. In all the circumstances with which we are acquainted, farming, as it is called, is essentially cruel—and unnecessarily so. It is unacceptable that that process should be supported and tolerated purely for the purpose of fashionable adornment. At present, it may be only mink that are subjected to such treatment, but it is perfectly proper that there should be a general prohibition of farming purely for the purposes of adornment and the profits associated with retailing.<br><br>
The last thing that I would want to do is to come to the assistance of the Minister, but to insert yet further elucidation into the text of the Bill would be simply to extend the scope for lawyers to make money out of it. The Bill's underlying purpose is precisely as my hon. Friend described. As a sponsor of the Bill, I do not think that anyone who supports it would deny that. What is wrong with that, pray? Surely that is the basis of the considerable popular support behind the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find it a matter of personal sadness and regret that my right hon. Friend and I are on opposite sides on the matter. I do not relish dispute with him; on most other occasions, I greatly value and respect his judgment. There is little value in the Committee descending into an exchange of well-known positions. My right hon. Friend and I will have to agree to disagree on the issue. I plead with the Minister and the hon. Member for Garston to give further thought to the matter during the next few weeks, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the explanatory notes state, clause 1(1)
<br><blockquote><p>"creates a primary offence of keeping animals solely or primarily for slaughter for the value of their fur or for breeding progeny".</p></blockquote>
The notes go on to state that
<br><blockquote><p>"Subsection (2) creates a secondary offence of knowingly causing or permitting another person to keep animals solely or primarily"</p></blockquote>
for the same purposes. The first clause therefore confronts us with what the Bill is all about.<br><br>
I oppose clause 1 because I believe that it is profoundly mistaken. I appreciate that I am in a minority in the Committee, which I regret and do not relish. There are many precedents for hon. Members speaking at great length when they are opposing private Members' Bills for ulterior and not very concealed purposes. I do not intend to follow that example; it is not my way of conducting business. However, I wish to put on record why I believe that clause 1 should not stand part of the Bill, and shall do so as briefly as I can. I can be brief, because the arguments are well rehearsed—I do not claim any great originality in my point of view,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0665">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
First, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) said on Second Reading,
<br><blockquote><p>"one should be very slow to use the criminal law to impose one's own moral views on the community as a whole."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 5 March 1999; Vol. 326, c. 1351.]</p></blockquote>
Clause 1, of course, does precisely that. It takes what is currently a legal practice and, as it were, picks it up, moves it and drops it in the area of criminalisation. I believe that the hon. Member for Garston and her supporters are moving too quickly, for reasons that I shall give.<br><br>
Secondly, I am conscious—to use fashionable jargon—that society a consists of many minorities. As a libertarian, to use a convenient label, I believe passionately in the rights of individuals and minorities. Clause 1 selectively persecutes and victimises an extremely small minority—a dozen or so mink farmers. I find that I am instinctively on their side.<br><br>
I acknowledge that neither being wary of using the criminal law to impose a moral point of view nor objecting to prohibiting a minority livelihood is an absolute position. Other considerations must be taken into account. My objection to clause 1 standing part of the Bill is that its proponents have misjudged those other considerations. Clause 1 asserts by implication—its supporters are explicit in making the assertion—that fur farming is wrong in principle. One of their reasons for that, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Clark) said a moment ago, is that they regard fur as an inessential requirement. I do not share that view. If the wearing of fur is not wrong—I believe that the hon. Member for Carston has said that, and has also made clear that she has no intention of trying to ban it I do not see how the production of fur can be wrong in principle. I emphasise "in principle". From what I have heard the hon. Lady say, and from her written comments, which I have read, the logical position for her to adopt would be to assert that it is the practice of fur farming that is wrong. To a certain extent, I believe that she is saying that. She has come to the conclusion that the practice of fur farming cannot be made acceptable. I hope that I am not misrepresenting her views. In her opinion, the only alternative is to ban fur farming by making it a criminal offence. I regret to say that she has not convinced me—on the contrary.<br><br>
Although fur farming did not feature prominently on my personal political agenda during the years prior to the appearance of this Bill, I received in that time a number of representations about it from individuals and groups. By and large, I was sympathetic with their cause. Only the focus of attention and debate generated by the Bill has led me to adopt an entirely different position from that which I thought that I might support.<br><br>
My opposition to clause 1 is based on an acceptance of the approach taken until now to animal welfare in every farming activity that involves animal husbandry and affects fur farming: the pursuit of welfare through regulation. I would strongly support the introduction of tighter regulations on the husbandry of mink if they were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
deemed necessary. Such an approach is used on the continent, in countries where mink farming is a significant industry. It is diametrically opposed to that adopted by the hon. Member for Garston in the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify his position? I think that he would agree that if clause 1 were removed, the Bill would present a slightly strange picture. Does he agree that by opposing the clause he is opposing the entire Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right; the Bill without clause 1 would be a most extraordinary being, which I would not think would receive the support of any hon. Member. When I began my remarks, I tried to explain that clause 1 is the focal point of the Bill. I oppose the principle of the Bill, which is enshrined in the clause. The hon. Gentleman was therefore right to say that my opposition to the clause is an expression of my opposition to the Bill as a whole.<br><br>
I was saying that a regulatory approach has been adopted on the continent, in countries where fur fanning is a significant industry, which is diametrically opposed to that proposed by the hon. Member for Garston. If enhanced regulation were to make mink fanning economically inviable—I do not accept that it would necessarily do so, and it has certainly not done so in some other countries—then so be it. I find it rather hard to accept the hon. Lady' s argument about such an approach, as her remarks are contrary to the Government's position. They are allowing scores of companies to be strangled by regulation. It is refreshing to hear the hon. Lady say that she opposes that, but her argument in respect of the Bill is not consistent with Government policy on other matters.<br><br>
I readily acknowledge that the clause is the heart of the Bill. It creates a draconian criminal offence of farming animals for their fur. For many decades, the farming of animals in the United Kingdom has rightly been the subject of animal welfare regulation and advice. Sometimes that has involved legal prohibition such as the banning from last January of the use of sow stalls and tethers in pig farming, which I supported.<br><br>
The Bill, and clause 1 in particular, constitute a fundamental and radical departure from the principle of permitting the farming of animals subject to welfare regulation. That departure means the criminalisation of one type of farming. I cannot, do not and ill not support that move.<br><br>
The Minister and other hon. Members will be aware that the Farm Animal Welfare Council last looked at the subject of welfare in mink farming 10 years ago. It concluded that more research was needed to determine the optimum enclosure for mink and to improve welfare conditions, taking into account other criteria.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Maria Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Farm Animal Welfare Council refused to set acceptable standards for mink 10 years ago because it could not be clear about what they were. It said, in effect, that mink were wild animals that should not be kept in the way that they were.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0666">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that interpretation of the Farm Animal Welfare Council's non-scientific research into mink in 1989.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angela Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will be glad to. The hon. Lady will be aware that doing so will lengthen proceedings, which is not my intention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angela Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman, who is reluctant to give way, and thank him for doing so. To reiterate the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Garston, I should mention a letter from the Farm Animal Welfare Council, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have decided against drawinq up a Welfare Code for mink and fox farming to avoid giving it the stamp of approval which a Government-backed Welfare Code would imply."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that clarification, but it does not detract from my essential point that the research has not been done in the United Kingdom—although my emphasis in making the point may have been wrong. Research has been conducted in Holland. The Dutch Government have undertaken a detailed scientific study of mink farming and have developed a new, progressive standard for welfare. That brings to mind another dimension of the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Maria Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Dutch Government have also banned fox farming. Does the hon. Gentleman realise that even the Dutch Government are in favour of banning some kinds of farming?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not aware of that, but I do not claim to be the world's greatest expert in fur farming. I merely make the point, which I think is correct, that scientific study of mink has been undertaken in Holland. It resulted in a tightened regime of regulation for mink farming, and not criminalisation.<br><br>
The other dimension that the reference to Holland brings to mind is that the closure of the 12 mink farms in Great Britain would hardly strike a major blow for animal welfare in total. There would still be 8,000 mink farmers on the continent of Europe who would continue to benefit from new welfare standards and a regime of regulation on which we appear to be turning our backs.<br><br>
The fact that supporters of clause 1 and of a ban on mink farming find such farming distasteful is no substitute for independent, objective scientific advice or for considering the possibility of new tightened regimes. In the absence of such scientific advice, fur farming should be permitted to continue.<br><br>
I support the proposition that more demanding regulations should protect the welfare of mink if necessary, but I do not accept the approach of criminalising mink farming. I oppose the clause standing part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Maria Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Basingstoke for his clear exposition on why he opposes clause 1, and, of course, I understand it. He said that he approached the issue from a libertarian position. I therefore realise that I have no chance whatever of persuading him to accept my arguments. Although I do
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
not agree with his position, I respect that it is perfectly possible to hold it. I fear that he and I will have to disagree, just as he and his right hon. Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea did earlier.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke has, however, raised several issues on which I want to comment briefly, although they were considered extensively on Second Reading. He said that the criminal law should not be used lightly to impose a moral view—a point that his right hon. Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham made on Second Reading. But, society regularly uses the criminal law to do just that. Where Parliament deems fit, it is perfectly allowable, in my view, to use the criminal law to protect the welfare and well-being of animals. It is not only this Bill—or, if it is enacted, this piece of legislation—that does that. There is a whole raft of legislation which attempts to protect animals and deal with the way in which they are treated in this country.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke suggests that clause 1 is wrong in principle because he does not believe that minorities should be imposed upon, or that activities which are currently lawful should be banned. I disagree with him about that. I believe that it is wrong in principle to farm animals purely for the production of their fur. The right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea made a very succinct case for that in his intervention, which I shall not repeat. I also take the view that it is both practically and economically impossible for improved welfare standards to make fur farming, especial of mink, acceptable in a civilised society. I do not believe that it is possible for a wild animal, such as a mink, to be farmed intensively, while at the same time ensuring that its welfare is maintained to a high enough standard.<br><br>
I take the view that it is more honest and straightforward to ban the practice and compensate those who will suffer as a result. The hon. Member for Basingstoke takes the view, as do a number of his right hon. and hon. Friends who spoke against the Bill on Second Reading, that such farmers should not be driven out of business by the imposition of excessively expensive regulation, which they are bound to be unable to meet.<br><br>
The Member for Basingstoke, said that he is not an expert in this field. He may not be aware, therefore, that since 1980, the market for fur in this country has fallen by 99 per cent. In the late 1960s, there were 700 fur farms; there are now 13. The minority whom he seeks to protect by opposing clause 1 has been shrinking significantly over that time. They have been going out of business with no assistance to enable them to start other businesses or diversify into other activities.<br><br>
The Bill enshrines the honest and open view that if we believe in principle and in practice that fur farming should be stopped, we should ban it. The Bill provides a date by which such a practice will become unlawful, so that there is no uncertainty among those who will lose their businesses. There is a provision, which we shall debate later, for paying compensation. That is about as honest and open as one can get. The hon. Member for Basingstoke and I will not agree on the principle. I am not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0667">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
a libertarian; I think that some things outweigh the rights of minorities, no matter how small the minorities may be. The Bill has a balanced approach to dealing with that difficult issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike Hancock <span class='memberconstituency'>(Portsmouth, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the contribution of the hon. Member for Garston. I think that she has spoken for the overwhelming majority of right hon. and hon. Members and for the overwhelming majority of the British public. I congratulate the hon. Member for Basingstoke on being brief in trying to defend the indefensible in opposing clause 1. As members of the Committee have said, his proposal was a positive move to wreck the Bill. Effectively, the Bill can go nowhere without clause 1.1 imagine that his proposal was a significant gesture to try to frustrate the aims of those of us who would like the Bill to become law.<br><br>
Prior to the Bill's publication, the hon. Member for Basingstoke did not make it clear where he stood on fur farming and, in particular, meat farming. He said that the Bill had hardened his libertarian view that fur farming should be allowed to continue, but did not say—nor did he tell us of his experiences—whether he believed that mink farming was carried out humanely, or whether, indeed, that that was possible. Many of us would suggest that it is impossible to farm a wild animal humanely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee if I did not make myself clear. I do not object in principle to mink farming, or to fur farming of any kind. I want, however, an acceptable level of animal welfare to be maintained by regulations. That is my position. I do not support the criminalisation of fur farming.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hancock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification. However, it has been proved that, despite regulation, it has been impossible to farm mink humanely and in a way that is acceptable to the overwhelming majority of the British people.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also suggested that the Bill was a quick response to people's concerns. I speak for many people when I suggest that progress this in reaching this point has been slow. The hon. Member for Garston should be congratulated on being successful in the ballot and on putting this issue high on her list of priorities for legislation. A big debt is owed to her for taking on this subject. Many of us believe that fur farming should have been dealt with and outlawed many years ago.<br><br>
I do not have a problem with the criminalisation of fur farming. The fact that people are prepared to inflict pain and suffering on animals simply to make money is inconsistent with the feelings of the majority of us as humans and with our relationship to the animal kingdom. I find it difficult to conceive that a civilised country would want the practice to continue.<br><br>
I hope that, in time, the wearing of fur will be deemed unjustifiable. I listened with interest to hon. Members who on Second Reading referred to the need of people in other parts of the world to wear fur because it is the only commodity realistically available to them to provide
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
warmth and protection from the severe winters that they face. That might be the case in some parts of the world, but it is not in the United Kingdom. There is no justifiable excuse for us to continue to farm mink for fur.<br><br>
I am sorry and disappointed for anyone who loses a job, but the loss of jobs or income in fur farming will be a natural repercussion of the Bill becoming law. When we outlawed the ownership of handguns, we did not offer too much sympathy—albeit we provided substantial compensation—to the people whose livelihoods were disturbed by the ban. On that occasion, we acted correctly and, on this occasion, I believe wholeheartedly that we are doing the right thing.<br><br>
I hope that members of the Committee will reject the suggestion that they should vote against clause stand part. I want the clause to be part of a Bill that materialises into law sooner rather than later. I urge the Committee to reject the call to vote against the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Loughton <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Worthing and Shoreham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee for long, but I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Garston on getting the Bill this far. I hope that we can proceed with great speed.<br><br>
I wish to comment on the case made by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke. If we do not accept clause 1, we shall wreck the whole Bill. My hon. Friend said that we should not accept the clause, and based his case on the ground that he is a libertarian. I, too, am a libertarian, but there are issues on which one must take a stand, libertarian or not, to bring society—to use an awful word—into 1999.<br><br>
I wonder what my hon. Friend's judgment would have been in the last century. Then, the slave trade and ownership of slaves was very much a minority activity, but it was deemed right at that time to ban it. Society deemed that it was an outdated and unacceptable practice for that century. Similarly, people deem, from a moral point of view, that fur farming is no longer an acceptable activity in this country in 1999. We want to send out a signal to the rest of the civilised world that we have taken that stand. The Bill seeks, as we shall find in later clauses, to protect the minority with what we hope will be a comprehensive compensation scheme. The minority who undertake fur farming will be free to use that compensation to set up in alternative and legitimate businesses.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke said that, for consistency's sake, the sponsor of the Bill should seek to ban the importing and wearing of furs in this country, and the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock) mentioned the compensation scheme for handguns. It is unrealistic to expect the good ladies of Kensington and Chelsea to queue up outside Chelsea police station to hand over their mink stoles and assorted apparel, however generous the compensation scheme, but that is not the point of the Bill.<br><br>
One reason why the Bill is attractive and why I felt able to support it is that it is closely and clearly defined and focused and is achievable and practicable. Whether it is right or acceptable to wear fur or to import fur coats that our constituents may wear is a different argument
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0668">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
that may arise in another Committee on another day; we are not debating that. The Committee is concerned with banning the practice of producing the raw materials for fur items in this country, and we must limit ourselves to that.<br><br>
We must take one step at a time, and the Bill takes a clear step. It sends a signal to the rest of the world that this country, which has a proud reputation of promoting high standards of animal welfare, believes that it is no longer acceptable to rear a wild animal—mink—in such conditions. Just as we have sent out clear signals on the banning of veal crates, the killing of whales or the ivory trade, it is wholly legitimate to send out the signal that we do not believe that fur farming is an acceptable practice in 1999, and other countries may like to take heed of our example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gareth R. Thomas <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make one or two brief comments about the situation in the Netherlands, to which the hon. Member for Basingstoke referred. It was nice to hear him say something positive about a European partner. However, I think that he has misinterpreted the position there. As my hon. Friend the Member for Garston made clear in her intervention on the hon. Gentleman, the farming of foxes and chinchilla was banned by the Dutch in 1995, while the farming of mink was given the benefit of the doubt. A much more detailed analysis is expected to be done in the Dutch Parliament in April this year of the fur industry's plan to improve the situation. That plan was not accepted by the Dutch Parliament.<br><br>
Interestingly, in Holland there has been a much more intense debate about fur farming and the farming of mink. According to a poll in February 1999 only 18 per cent, of the Dutch population share the hon. Gentleman's view that the breeding of mink could be made more animal-friendly, 91 per cent, believe that the killing of fur animals is unacceptable, and 86 per cent, believe that it is desirable to prohibit mink breeding. In the light of the Netherlands' experience, I strongly urge the hon. Member for Basingstoke to reconsider his view that regulation can make mink breeding more acceptable. I contend that circumstances in the Netherlands reinforce the opposite case—that mink farming cannot be made more animal-friendly. The hon. Gentleman should withdraw his opposition to the clause.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
FORFEITURE ORDERS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 2, line 2, leave out "or other disposal".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 12, in clause 3, page 2, line 27, leave out "or other disposal".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak more briefly to these amendments than I did to my previous ones. Subsection (3) deals with forfeiture orders and gives the court power to make an order
<br><blockquote><p>"for the forfeiture and destruction or other disposal"</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
of animals in the event of a person's conviction either of the primary offence under clause 1—the keeping of animals solely and primarily for slaughter—or the secondary offence of breeding progeny for slaughter.<br><br>
My amendments question the appropriateness of the words "or other disposal" and I should like to explore what the hon. Member for Garston means by them. I would like to clarify what possible means of disposal there could be other than the destruction of the animals that are the subject of the forfeiture order.<br><br>
It seems axiomatic to the Bill—almost as self-evident as anything could be—that, in the circumstances created by the Bill, destruction is the only feasible course of action. Obviously, the mink cannot be used for fur farming, which will be banned by the Bill. The provision would not come into play until mink farming was a criminal activity. There is no question whatever of mink seized under forfeiture being used in farms in England, Scotland or Wales—the territorial remit to which the Bill applies.<br><br>
I find it hard to accept that the hon. Member for Garston wants the mink to be exported to mink farms in other countries where mink farming remains legal. I find it equally beyond the bounds of credibility that the hon. Lady believes that the mink could become ideal family pets. I cannot accept that she envisages releasing them into the countryside or exporting them for release in the countryside of other countries. Why, then, does the Bill provide for the disposal of mink by means other than destruction? What does the hon. Lady have in mind? If she has nothing in mind, why are the words "or other disposal" in the Bill? If there are no other means of disposal, would it not be better to omit the words from subsection (3), as the amendment urges?<br><br>
Amendment No. 12 relates to clause 3 and deals with the effect of a forfeiture order. The clause provides a right of appeal to any person claiming to have an interest in the animals that are subject to the forfeiture. Precisely the same arguments that I made on amendment No. 11 apply here, so there is no need to repeat them.<br><br>
On reflection, I should have tabled an amendment to clause 3 (3) where the words "otherwise disposed" appear. That was an oversight, which may be corrected at a later stage, if necessary. The essential point of the amendments is that there is no other means of disposal, so it would be better if the words were omitted from the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Maria Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Basingstoke, thereby preventing him from having to work hard and table the consequential amendment that he overlooked. I hope to persuade him to withdraw his amendment, so there will be no need for us to tidy up clause 3.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is correct that the overwhelmingly likely method of the disposal of mink is destruction. However, he failed to consider that the Bill covers other types of fur farming that may come on the scene, or which already exist, but which are unlicensed. Some fur-bearing animals are kept primarily for their fur, although I do not think that that happens in this country at present. If they were to fall foul of this measure, they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0669">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
could be disposed of in another way. Chinchilla spring to mind—they are often kept as pets. Althought one would not wish to keep mink as pets, or to dispose of them by setting them free, circumstances could be envisaged in which animals that are not mink are forfeited and disposed of in other ways. That is why the words to which the hon. Gentleman objects are included. I accept that it is unlikely that that provision will be used—certainly not in respect of mink. I assure him that if mink are forfeit, they will be destroyed. There is no other sensible method of disposal.<br><br>
Were the Bill to be applied to other species, other methods of disposal may be appropriate in some circumstances. That is why the words "or other disposal" are in the Bill. With that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation. The hon. Lady rightly reminds me that the Bill encourages us to focus our attention on mink, but it has wider future application to other animals. I confess that I lost sight of that wider futuristic element when thinking about my amendments. I accept her explanation and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Maria Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 2 deals with relevant powers to enforce the Bill; it refers to the power of the court to make a forfeiture order in the event of a conviction. It relates to the animals kept at the time the order is made, or until it is carried out. There is provision for someone who claims to have an interest in the animals to apply to the court to be heard before the order is made, as we would not want to take away someone's property without giving him a chance to be heard. The circumstances in which that might happen are hard to imagine, but they are possible. The Bill therefore includes a provision for a third party to be heard by the court in respect of the order. Such a case might involve, for example, someone who owns the animals but does not keep them, and who would lose financially were they to be forfeited.<br><br>
That is the simple factual explanation. Clause 2 will implement clause 1 and make it effective. I hope that hon. Members will understand that it is a vital part of the Bill and will support it.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is rather complicated, but I shall try to make it as simple as possible. Before presenting the arguments for the five amendments, it may help if I first focus the Committee's attention on their effects, and subsequently try to explain why I have tabled them.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 relate to clause 3. As I explained in the context of my previous amendment, in the words of the explanatory notes, clause 3
<br><blockquote><p>"deals with the effect of a forfeiture order, and provides a right of appeal (to the Crown Court or, in Scotland, the High Court of Justiciary) which is available to any person claiming to have an interest in the animals … Although the forfeiture order could take effect immediately on being made, so as to deprive any person of his rights in the animals kept at the date of the order, the destruction or other disposal of the animals pursuant to the forfeiture order must be deferred until there is no further possibility of the order being set aside on appeal."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 13 would delete subsection (2) (b), which refers to Scotland's High Court of Justiciary. Amendment No. 14 would delete subsection (6), which refers to section 221 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, so that that Act would not apply to the recovery of fines.<br><br>
Amendment No. 15 would amend clause 5, which, according to the explanatory notes, will give the "appropriate Minister"—perhaps to become the "appropriate authority"—as defined in clause 6,
<br><blockquote><p>"power by order to make a scheme for paying compensation to persons who incur losses as a result of discontinuing fur farming businesses because of the enactment or coming into force of the prohibition in clause 1."</p></blockquote>
The amendment would delete clause 5 (3) (a) and (b) and, after the words "determined by", would insert the words "the Lands Tribunal". It is consequential to the amendments to clause 3.<br><br>
All the amendments would remove Scotland from the Bill's remit. If that happens at one point, it must happen consistently through the Bill—hence the need to remove clause 5 (3) (a) and (b). Amendment No. 15 follows logically from my amendments to clause 3.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 relate to clause 7. Amendment No. 16 would delete subsection (4). It is consequential to my other amendments that relate to Scotland, and is required for the sake of consistency. Amendment No. 17 would leave in tact the assertion that the Bill does not apply to Northern Ireland, but would add "or to Scotland". To state the blatantly obvious, the amendments are all concerned with the territorial extent of the Bill.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0670">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
As drafted, the Bill covers England, Wales and Scotland but, by virtue of clause 7, it does not apply to Northern Ireland. The amendments would ensure that Scotland and Northern Ireland were outside its scope. I presume that Northern Ireland is excluded from the Bill for the same reason as it is outside the remit of much primary legislation. When direct rule was introduced, old Stormont legislation remained on the statute book until amended in accordance with the Northern Ireland Act 1974, and mainly by secondary legislation and Orders in Council.<br><br>
I refer now to the technicalities of the Northern Ireland Act 1974. Under direct rule—which the Government hope and intend to soon end—the provisions of the Bill could only apply to Northern Ireland if they were introduced by an Order in Council. However, if the Belfast accord—the Good Friday agreement—is fully implemented, responsibility for the Bill will pass to the new Northern Ireland Assembly, working in tandem with the new north-south body on agriculture. It is the Government's intention that fur farming issues will, for Northern Ireland, be a devolved matter.<br><br>
Since May 1997, the Government have had devolution or home rule on their agenda for both Scotland and Northern Ireland. Under the Bill, there is a remarkable and so far unexplained discrepancy or contradiction. In advance of devolution, the Bill provides that fur farming will be a devolved issue for Northern Ireland, but not for Scotland. That will have been determined for Scotland by the United Kingdom Parliament before the Scottish Parliament has come into being. Given the Government's strong commitment to devolution in the United Kingdom, what is their justification for including Scotland in the Bill?<br><br>
The point at issue is unaffected by the fact that there are no fur farms in Scotland or Northern Ireland. It is our duty as a Committee to deliberate and return to the House what we consider to be a sensible, fair and reasonable Bill. After the elections in May, a Scottish Parliament will be in place with extensive powers to set its own laws. Agriculture will be a devolved power—but not fur farming or responsibility for it. The Government are pre-empting any debate that might take place in the new Scottish about fur farming.<br><br>
The question posed by the amendments is why does the hon. Member for Garston wish to pre-empt what the Scottish Parliament, with its greater powers, may decide about fur farming? As a consequence of the ending of direct rule in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Assembly, with its lesser powers, will be able to do what it wants on the matter. Surely Northern Ireland and Scotland should be treated the same.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Maria Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly happy to try to explain the apparent paradox to the hon. Gentleman. I think that he may have missed an opportunity for a consequential amendment, although he has done well to pick out most of them. Clause 6 (b) contains a reference to Scotland that he may also, for consistency, want to consider removing. I hope that I can persuade him that he does not have to press the amendment, and that I can explain what he views as an apparent contradiction.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
As the promoter of a Bill, one considers its scope and talks to those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland who have an interest in the Bill to see what their views are. That was done in the preparation for the Bill's drafting. It is a Great Britain Bill because the Scottish Office wanted it that way—when it was asked whether it was content for the Bill to apply to Scotland, it said that it was happy for it to do so.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is right to have spotted the fact that Stormont has had devolved power for agriculture legislation since 1920 and that under the Good Friday agreement, to the extent to which it is implemented, it will have it again. It is usual for agriculture legislation to be dealt with through the direct rule provisions and, I hope in due course through Stormont again. When consulted, the Northern Ireland authorities therefore wanted to deal with the issue themselves. That is why Northern Ireland is excluded. I hope that that explains what he considers to be an apparent contradiction.<br><br>
I would also like to raise some practical issues. It is right to say that the remaining fur farms exist only in England at present. However, there were fur farms in Scotland until 1993. As I understand it, the infrastructure, now empty, remains and could quickly be filled were Scotland to be excluded from the Bill; the practice could simply migrate north. That would be another way in which the provisions of the Bill could be evaded, and, as promoter of the Bill, I sought to prevent it from occurring.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman is satisfied with that explanation of why Scotland is included and Northern Ireland is not, and I hope that he will not press the amendment. If he does, I shall oppose it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the hon. Lady was correct to suggest that I overlooked including clause 6 (b) in my amendments, because the reference to the Secretary of State merely confirms that the power will not be devolved to Scotland. The Secretary of State is outside the governance of Scotland under the Scotland Act 1998 and the terms of the Scottish Parliament. That is an academic debate, and we need not pursue it.<br><br>
I was most interested in the hon. Lady's explanation that the Scottish Office was happy for the United Kingdom Parliament to legislate on fur farming in Scotland prior to the establishment of the Scottish Parliament, but that the Northern Ireland Office felt otherwise. I do not challenge the fact that that may be the explanation, but it is profoundly unsatisfactory that, before the creation of the Assembly in Belfast and the Scottish Parliament, Ministers—I presume—and civil servants arbitrarily decided who would determine the fate of fur farming legislation in the Province or in Scotland. That strikes me as incredibly arrogant; surely it is for elected politicians to decide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Maria Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing to stop the new Scottish Parliament taking further steps or a different view in future. I have adopted a practical approach to try to reach agreement so that the Bill is enacted.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Lady says. There is no particular value or merit in pressing the amendment any further. The Committee will be grateful to her for explaining the apparent discrepancy. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 2, line 31, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"() Any animal destroyed in pursuance of a forfeiture order made under this Act shall be destroyed in accordance with the requirements of such regulations concerning the slaughter or killing of animals of the relevant species as may be in force at the appropriate time,".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 19, page 2, line 31, in at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>" () Where the court appoints a person to carry out a forfeiture order in accordance with subsection (4) of this section, the court shall satisfy itself that that person is suitably qualified in the handling and welfare of the species of animal concerned.".</p></blockquote>
No. 20, in page 2, line 31, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>" () Where the court appoints a person to carry out a forfeiture order in accordance with subsection (4) of this section, the court shall require that person to keep the animals concerned in compliance with such regulations regarding animal welfare as applied to fur fanning prior to the coming into force of sections 1 to 4 of this Act.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under amendment No. 18, a new paragraph would be inserted at the end of subsection (4). The explanatory notes state that clause 3
<br><blockquote><p>"deals with the effect of a forfeiture order, and provides a right of appeal … which is available to any person claiming to have an interest in the animals which are the subject of a forfeiture order. Although the forfeiture order could take effect immediately on being made, so as to deprive any person of his rights in the animals kept at the date of the order, the destruction … of the animals pursuant to the forfeiture order must be deferred until there is no further possibility of the order being set aside on appeal."</p></blockquote>
An important point must now be made. I ask the hon. Member for Garston, in contemplating what I am saying, to try to forget our fundamental differences on other matters. Those differences are not clouding or influencing my judgment now. The clause makes no provision to ensure that the animals subject to a forfeiture order will be destroyed in accordance with the requirements of the specific regulations that apply to the slaughter or killing of animals of the relevant species—obviously, we are primarily dealing with mink.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will realise that mink farmers must observe and abide by the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995, under which three methods of slaughtering farmed mink are permitted. Neither the Bill nor the 1995 regulations unambiguously specifies how forfeit mink should be destroyed, although the regulations refer to the slaughter or killing of farmed mink for the purpose of their fur being marketed.<br><br>
If the hon. Lady and the Government assume that the 1995 regulations will apply to forfeitured mink, what basis is there for that assumption? If I am wrong, and they do not so assume, I presume that they will take steps to rectify this omission or oversight. I hope that the hon. Lady can reassure me on this issue.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
Amendment No. 19 proposes inserting another new subsection. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the court appoints a person to carry out a forfeiture order in accordance with subsection (4) of this section, the court shall satisfy itself that that person is suitably qualified in the handling and welfare of the species of animal concerned."</p></blockquote>
As the explanatory note explains, subsection (4) gives the court making a forfeiture order power to require, for example, the offender who is keeping the animals to continue to keep them, pending their destruction or other disposal. Alternatively, that person can pay the reasonable expenses of any other person in keeping the animals, pending their destruction. A person appointed by the court to carry out a forfeiture order will be acting as an agent of the court.<br><br>
It is clear that nothing in the Bill precludes the court from appointing the convicted mink farmer to carry out the destruction of the mink which he has been keeping illegally. This deliverance of the final solution might be attractive to the court because the convicted mink farmer would have the experience, means and wherewithal to dispose of the mink. However, the mink farmer might not be available to carry out the task for some quite reasonable reason. Or the court might decide that the convicted mink farmer could not be trusted to destroy his own livelihood, and in those circumstances, it would have to find someone else to destroy the mink.<br><br>
Those are the circumstances that I seek to address in the amendment. Its purpose is to ensure that whoever is appointed by the court is suitably qualified and experienced in the handling and welfare of the species of animal concerned—namely, the mink. Great play was made on Second Reading, and reference has been made today, to the dangers that mink pose to wildlife if released, either deliberately—as animal welfare terrorists and other so-called activists have done—or accidentally, as might be the case if the court appointee was inexperienced in his handling of mink. The point was made forcefully on Second Reading on 5 March by my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne). The hon. Lady made the same observation in her speech, which can be found in column 1336 of the <i>Official Report,</i> and so did the hon. Members for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer), for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey) and for Harrow, West (Mr. Thomas), among others.<br><br>
I believe that most people would agree with the implications of what those hon. Members said in this respect on Second Reading. As is the case with all animal husbandry and care, and the handling of animals at all times, experience is highly desirable, if not essential, and mink are no exception. I argue, in support of the amendment, that it would clearly not be desirable from the point of view of safety or of animal welfare if an inexperienced person were to be given this job.<br><br>
Amendment No. 20 would insert yet another new subsection, between subsections (3) and (4). It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the court appoints a person to carry out a forfeiture order in accordance with subsection (4) of this section, the court shall require that person to keep the animals concerned in compliance with such regulations regarding animal welfare as applied to fur farming prior to the coming into force of sections 1 to 4 of this Act."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0672">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
Clause 3(3) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"No animals shall be destroyed or otherwise disposed of in pursuance of a forfeiture order until (disregarding any power of a court to grant leave to appeal out of time) there is no further possibility of the order being set aside."</p></blockquote>
The Committee will agree that taking an appeal through the different levels of court that exist in our judicial system could be a lengthy process. It could take one or two years, rather than one or two months before the system was exhausted. Everyone who is genuinely concerned about animal welfare will want all the appropriate standards to be applied to the animals pending the decision on what should be done to them.<br><br>
I hope that we can continue to make progress on the Bill, so I shall reduce my argument for the sake of simplicity. Amendment No. 20 would ensure that the person who kept the animals during the judicial process was obliged to comply with the animal welfare regulations that were in force in respect of the farming of animals for fur immediately before the criminalisation of fur farming came into effect. Amendment No. 20 and the others in the group are wholly reasonable, and the Committee should accept them on the grounds that they detract not one iota from the Bill's main purpose and intention. They genuinely and positively promote animal welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Maria Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising those issues. Despite our earlier disagreements, I have no doubt that his major concern is animal welfare.<br><br>
In his last point about clause 3 (3), the hon. Gentleman referred in particular to the potentially lengthy period that might elapse before it was decided that the order could not be set aside. He is right about lawyers. Judicial procedures can take an enormous amount of time, and I am having a think about that. We could be talking about a lengthy system of appeal and about various ways appealing out of time, which could extend into months and, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, years.<br><br>
I hope that, for the reasons I am about to give the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment. I hope that he will instead take into account my remarks and the assurances that I will give him about animal welfare concerns. The Bill will have no impact on general animal welfare obligations that are still in force. Two of the three amendments are, therefore, unnecessary. They would put into the Bill provisions that already exist in other legislation; the amended Bill would not affect those other provisions if it passed into law. I recognise, however, that the hon. Gentleman has the best of intentions and wants to ensure that standards are kept as high as possible. He is correct to be concerned about that.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the problem of the courts appointing people who are incompetent to deal with the destruction of animals. The court will have discretion as to whom to appoint. Having appeared before many courts that were considering appointing experts, I am certain that those responsible will have it at the forefront of their minds that they should appoint competent people. One would expect the people to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
whom they are most likely to turn to be ministry officials, who have extensive experience of dealing with such issues. Court discretion should be sufficient to guarantee that incompetent people are not appointed. I should be very surprised if a court were to appoint anyone who could not prove his capability to do the job.<br><br>
However, I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern. I hope that he will bear with me in respect of clause 3 (3) and the length of time for which animals may need to be kept after forfeit. I realise that that is a potential problem, but I am not minded to accept his amendments now—partly because two of them do not add to the current provision. I am certain that if the 1995 regulations do not apply, the simpler course would be to amend them to ensure that they do. I am sure that the Ministry will seriously consider doing that, if the hon. Gentleman has identified a loophole—my hon. Friend the Minister may have something to say about that. That would be preferable to trying to load into a small Bill existing standards applied under other legislation, which ought anyway to apply. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Baker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lewes)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable sympathy with the points made by the hon. Member for Basingstoke, as I believe that the hon. Lady herself has. If she is not minded to accept the amendments, will she undertake to examine whether the points that they legitimately raise are covered by existing legislation—whether the belt and braces necessary to ensure that the courts act properly are in place—and to return later if necessary to incorporate the amendments' provisions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Maria Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I undertake to do that. I am conscious of the fact that I am not the Minister, but I hope to persuade the Ministry to do that as well. I shall raise that with the Ministry and find out whether it has spotted any such loophole. I would not want such a loophole to remain, but I am not convinced that it exists, which is why I do not intend to accept the amendments today. However, I certainly undertake to return to the matter later during the Bill's passage if there is a problem.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Maria Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has recently struck me just how long the legal process can take; I have recognised that as a potential problem.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful brief exchange on the three amendments. I am most satisfied with what the hon. Lady has said.

<p><span class='member'>Maria Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although the amendments look complex, their effect would simply be to pass to the National Assembly for Wales the power to make an order for compensation and the power to authorise persons to exercise the power of entry. That should have been put into the Bill, but it was overlooked in the rush.<br><br>
The National Assembly for Wales will, of course, have the authority to deal with secondary legislation when it is established. The amendments would avoid the need to make a transfer of functions order at a later date. The power in clause 5 to make the order does not come into force until two months after Royal Assent, so there is no need for a transitional provision enabling the Secretary of State for Wales to exercise the powers before 1 July. Right hon. and hon. Members will know that there are currently no mink farms in Wales, and one would not therefore expect secondary legislation in respect of compensation to have to be made. Nevertheless, all eventualities must be taken into consideration. That is the purpose of the amendments, and I commend them to the Committee.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 4 confers a power of entry and inspection to enable the gathering of evidence.

I quote, and endorse, what my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) said about the clause on Second Reading:
<br><blockquote><p>"Under clause 4 we have our old friend—no, it is not a friend; our normal cause for concern—powers of entry and enforcement.

I want to hear much more about that before I am satisfied of the workability or desirability of the measure."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 5 March 1999; Vol. 326, c. 1394.]</p></blockquote>
My starting point is to sympathise with those sentiments, which I share. I shall now develop the argument. As I said, clause 4 provides Ministers —or now the appropriate authority—with a power to authorise a person to enter premises if he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that fur farming is taking place on those premises. The essence of my argument is that the clause as drafted will allow the Minister or authority to give a general authorisation for entry as well as authorisation for particular cases. Such a general authorisation is heavy handed, to say the least. Britain has only a dozen or so mink farms, so a general authorisation will encourage a trawling mentality in the mind of the person authorised.<br><br>
The basic point and purpose of the amendment is to ensure that authority to enter premises is given on a case-by-case basis. The Minister or authority should be convinced that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence has been or is being committed at a precise location, and authority should be obtained for entry into that precise location. I hope that the hon. Member for Garston will respond positively to the amendment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 21 seeks to insert a new subsection between subsections (1) and (2) of the clause. The proposed subsection states
<br><blockquote><p>"No person shall be authorised by the appropriate authority in accordance with subsection (1) of this section unless that person is a police officer or an official veterinarian."</p></blockquote>
I reminded the Committee a moment ago that the clause confers powers of entry and inspection that apply for two purposes—for gathering evidence and for carrying out a forfeiture order. Amendment No. 21 would ensure that the person authorised by the Minister would be suitable for the purpose that the Bill intends. As the amendment shows, by a suitable person I mean either a police officer or an official veterinarian. The Committee will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0674">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
presumably be aware that official veterinarian means either one of the Minister's own vets in the state veterinary service or a qualified veterinarian who is licensed to operate on behalf of that service.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will agree that the intention of amendment No. 21 is sound in terms of the Bill's general aims. It would prevent conferral on inappropriate people of the power of entry and inspection. Such people include those who are not qualified or experienced in the handling of animals and people whose interest and involvement stems from the fact that they represent pressure groups. The interest and involvement of such people in the enactment of the Bill is beyond dispute, but their practical experience in handling mink may be limited.<br><br>
Reduced to simple terms, the purpose of amendment No. 21 is to ensure that inappropriate people are not authorised to enter premises to gather evidence or to carry out a forfeiture order. The amendment is wholly reasonable, and seeks to safeguard animals' well-being—it is an animal welfare amendment. It would not remotely detract from the smooth implementation of the Bill; on the contrary, it promotes the Bill's intentions.</span></p>
<p>I urge the Committee to accept the amendment.</p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Elliot Morley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>:
As we are moving into the area of Ministry functions and powers, it is perhaps appropriate if I deal with the points that the hon. Member for Basingstoke has just made.<br><br>
I begin by adding my congratulations and thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston for introducing the Bill and dealing with it so professionally and succinctly. It is good to see the Bill making such progress. I agree with her that we must move on with the Bill, because we do not want those affected to be left in limbo or in doubt, but we must deal with appropriate concerns. I think that I can answer the hon. Gentleman's points with an explanation and an assurance.<br><br>
First, the Bill contains the standard powers of entry—the normal wording in any legislation of this kind—so there is no need for the narrow restriction proposed in amendment No. 23. Ministers currently authorise staff in the Farming and Rural Conservation Agency to undertake inspections under the Destructive Imported Animals Act 1932. That is a general authority. It would be difficult and impractical to make an individual authorisation each time an inspection was necessary.<br><br>
I can give the hon. Gentleman an assurance that Ministers would authorise only competent people to do an inspection. They would be Ministry staff in the FRCA or the state veterinary service: people with experience of carrying out such inspections and dealing with such animals. Furthermore, as the hon. Gentleman probably realises, police officers do not need authorisation to enter property: they already have that authorisation.<br><br>
I understand what the hon. Gentleman means by the term "official veterinarian", but there is no standard definition of that phrase. Therefore, it would be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
inappropriate to use the term in legislation, as no one could define it or would know what it meant. The term "official veterinary surgeon" applies to vets who work in the Ministry, often in connection with meat hygiene and meat standards, so it is not appropriate here.<br><br>
The amendments would make the Bill unworkable. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurances and explanations and seek to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for those comments, which on the whole I accept. However, I want to challenge him on one or two points. The first is his defence of the generality of authorisation. I do not find his arguments convincing, because we are talking about only a handful of places where the power of entry would apply. I accept that, for administrative reasons, individual authorisations could not be given for more popular farming activities, but I cannot see why they could not be given for so few fur farmers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, the Bill has been worded for the future also, when fur farming has ceased in this country, to ensure that it does not start up again. However, the general powers are there for existing fur farms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the third time this morning, I have been guilty of forgetting the future element of the Bill. I apologise for that. If I understood the Minister correctly, he said that there was no standard definition of "official veterinarian". I was unaware of that. I accept what he said, but surely it would be possible for the Bill to provide such a definition. That could he done by amendment.<br><br>
I may have confused the term "official veterinarian" with "official veterinary surgeon", and I am not sure of the advantages of either. However, will the Minister comment on my suggestion that the Bill could be amended so that it contains a definition of "official veterinarian"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly give further thought to that suggestion. However, the term "competent person" will offer the type of definition that the hon. Gentleman seeks. The Ministry has the power to appoint a competent person, who could be a veterinary surgeon. Therefore, we do not need the term "official veterinarian", which is effectively meaningless because it is not formally defined. I shall examine the interpretations to ensure that they are correct, and I am willing to consider the hon. Gentleman's suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has satisfactorily answered the questions raised by the amendment, but I wanted to pick up on one point. The Minister and the hon. Member for Basingstoke have rightly referred to the word "competent", but I cannot see it in the clause. I understand that the Minister will authorise Ministry of Agriculture staff who will, by definition, be competent. Nevertheless, does he object to including the word "competent" in the Bill so that there is no possibility of animal welfare considerations being threatened by the appointment of someone who is not competent?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I am prepared to consider whether that suggestion would be appropriate.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Hunter, have you finished your speech?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not quite, because I want to say to the Committee that I appreciate the Minister's remarks. Provided that he will continue to consider the two outstanding issues, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is just possible that the Bill might complete its Committee stage this morning. I have the powers to extend the sitting to 1.15 pm and, at ten minutes to 11 shall decide whether to use them. Whether I use them will depend on the length of Members' speeches and on any wink or nod that they may care to give me about whether they wish to finish this morning.</span></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in understanding that we are now on the clause stand part debate? If so, there is just one point that I wish to make. In the light of your comments, Dr. Clark, I shall be brief.<br><br>
I regret that the money resolution is narrow. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"That, for the purpose of any Act resulting from the Fur Farming (Prohibition) Bill, it is expedient to authorise the payment out of money provided by Parliament of any expenditure incurred by a Minister of the Crown in consequence of any compensation scheme made under the Act."</p></blockquote>
I emphasise the words "any compensation scheme".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Maria Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What does this have to do with the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is speaking to amendment No. 22.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I am.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is speaking to amendment No. 22, which has not been selected. We have debated amendments Nos. 21 and 23, but the hon. Member is speaking to amendment No. 22.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Maria Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of information, I understood that we were debating clause 4 stand part. Clause 4 deals with powers of entry, not compensation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is absolutely right. We are debating clause 4 stand part and we have debated amendment No. 23, coupled with amendment No. 21. The hon. Member for Basingstoke started his speech by asking whether we were debating clause 4 stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This may be a manifestation of my total incompetence, but I shall speak to clause 4. I apologise sincerely if I have made a mistake, but I was under the impression that the amendment that was not related to clause 4. My point—I am apparently making it slowly, hesitantly and badly—is that I regret that the money resolution applies only to clause 5. I was about to say why I wished that it applied to clause 4. The money resolution is narrow, and the point that I wanted to make about clause 4 would be speaking to an amendment that was not selected, and therefore out of order. However, I wanted to make a general point in the clause stand part
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
debate. It is a deficiency of the Bill that the money resolution applies only to clause 5 and therefore does not allow me to make related comments on clause 4.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that you have kept yourself just about in order. We shall see how you go from here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Dr. Clark, and apologise to the Committee if I have been out of order. I am trying to make the point that I mentioned. I tabled an amendment to clause 4, which was not selected and therefore cannot be debated. I am therefore no longer speaking to an amendment, but to a broad theme. That broad theme is that clause 4 contains a deficiency, which I sought to amend through the amendment that was not selected.<br><br>
Clause 4 confers the power of entry and inspection to enable the gathering of evidence, and the power to enter premises to carry out a forfeiture order. As it stands—and this is my main concern—the clause provides no protection for persons whose premises are entered under those two powers. There should be protection against the possibility of suffering damage or loss by reason of the entry. For instance, a person authorised to enter may inadvertently cause damage to buildings or to property, and in such circumstances it is reasonable that the person whose property has been entered should be entitled to compensation in respect of any such damage or disturbance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Forgive me for interrupting, Mr. Hunter, but I have given you some leeway and you have managed to make your point on the record. However, you are still debating amendment No. 22. We should be debating what is in clause 4, not what is not in clause 4. You may wish to tackle your problem by asking the Minister to provide some assurances on clause 4, which may extend your argument further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that guidance. Would the Minister or the hon. Member for Garston point to which provisions in clause 4 serve the purpose that I mentioned? The clause has some points of merit and I hope that its subsections contain parallel provisions to those in the Land Powers (Defence) Act 1958 and the planning and compensation legislation. I am sure that it would be appropriate for clause 4 to provide such protection.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Maria</span><span class='membercontribution'> Eagle: I am happy to deal with the points of the hon. Member for Basingstoke, whom I congratulate on his ability to remain in order.<br><br>
I looked at amendment No. 22, although obviously, I shall not talk about it, because it has not been selected. I understand that there is common law protection if people come bashing in, causing damage to someone's premises. It is perfectly possible for someone to take a case to law, under common law rights, if he feels that losses have been incurred because of the way in which the power of entry has been exercised.</span></p>

<p>No. 3, in page 3, line 22, leave out "him" and insert "that authority".—[<i>Maria Eagle.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 24, in page 3, line 35, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"() Any compensation scheme made under this section shall include provision for the payments of the reasonable fees of the professional advisers of persons making claims.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 25, in page 3, line 35, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"() Any compensation scheme made under this section shall include provision for the payment on account where requested by the claimant of 90 per cent, of the amount of compensation agreed between the claimant and the appropriate authority, or in any other case of the amount of compensation that the appropriate authority estimates the claimant is entitled to under the scheme within 3 months of the submission of the claim.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 26, in page 3, line 35, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>" () Any compensation scheme made under this section shall include provision for the payment of interest, to be calculated on a compound basis, on the total of payments agreed at final settlement or as may be determined by arbitration."</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 27, in page 3, line 35, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>" () Any compensation scheme made under this section shall include provision for the cost of clearing the land in question of buildings or other fixed equipment utilised by the business.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be aware that amendment No. 24 would insert a new subsection to clause 5. The clause gives the appropriate ministerial authority, as defined in clause 6, the power
<br><blockquote><p>"by order to make a scheme for the making of payments by him to persons in respect of losses incurred by them as a result of ceasing … their businesses"</p></blockquote>
Subsection (1) makes it clear that compensation will be payable to such persons whether or not they are still carrying on their business on the date that the prohibition comes into force.<br><br>
Amendment No. 24 is a straightforward and uncomplicated amendment, which would insert a new subsection, enabling recipients of compensation to include the reasonable fees of their professional advisers. It has been standard practice for many years that claimants under the land compensation code are entitled to have the reasonable fees of their professional advisers paid for them by the acquiring authority.<br><br>
Such practice applies today to mink farmers, in some circumstances. For instance, if a new motorway were routed through land on which there was a mink farm and it became subject to a compulsory purchase order, the reasonable professional fees legitimately incurred by the mink farmer in promoting and safeguarding his interests would be included in the compensation to which he is entitled.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
Amendment No. 24 rests on the assertion that there is no difference in principle between compulsory purchase that arises from a new motorway going through a mink farmer's land, for example, and the compulsory ban on fur farming. The circumstances are directly analogous. In both cases, whether compulsory purchase for purposes of a road being built or the compulsory ending of fur farming, the state will be exercising a power of compulsion that it has given itself to confiscate the land and property of an individual. It has decided pro bono publico that that individual can no longer conduct his business or derive his livelihood from the land and property in question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Angela Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that, under handgun legislation, fees are not paid for professional advice? Such costs are borne by the handgun owners.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I remember that measure all too well. As with the Bill, I opposed it as much as I could. The two measures are not directly analogous. There is a difference in kind rather than degree between the confiscation of a handgun, from which few, if any, derive their livelihood, and the confiscation of the land, property and means of livelihood of a mink farmer.<br><br>
The argument for amendment No. 24 is strengthened by the fact that, viewed from a different perspective, the Bill will create a unique situation. Alone among farming activities, fur farming and fur farmers have been singled out as objects deserving hatred and persecution. Other farming activities that can cause environmental damage and give rise to serious animal welfare issues are not banned and will be dealt with by regulation. In the unique situation in which fur farmers will find themselves, it is not only right and proper, but essential that they have access to good quality professional advice when negotiating their compensation claims.<br><br>
Amendment No. 24 would ensure that professional advice could be properly obtained by including allowance for reasonable professional fees in compensation schemes. Circumstances already exist in which professional fees are included in compensation and those circumstances are analogous to those created by the Bill. Furthermore, the circumstances created by the Bill are even more deserving of the inclusion of reasonable professional fees in compensation schemes because of the special—indeed, unique—fate that the Bill has in store for fur farmers. There are powerful arguments in favour of the amendment and I hope that the hon. Lady will respond positively to them.<br><br>
Amendment No. 25 would insert a new subsection into the clause. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any compensation scheme made under this section shall include provision for the payment on account where requested by the claimant of 90 per cent, of the amount of compensation agreed between the claimant and the appropriate authority, or in any other case of the amount of compensation that the appropriate authority estimates the claimant is entitled to under the scheme within 3 months of the submission of the claim.'."</p></blockquote>
In respect of the previous amendment, I reminded the Committee that, according to the explanatory notes,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0677">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
clause 5 will give the "appropriate Minister" the authority, as defined in clause 6, or
<br><blockquote><p>"power by order to make a scheme for paying compensation to persons who incur losses as a result of discontinuing fur farming businesses".</p></blockquote>
Since 1973, claimants for compensation under the land compensation code have been entitled to request advance payments on account of 90 per cent, of the agreed compensation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Maria Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to be suggesting that the Bill will take people's land from them. It will not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Basingstoke will recall that, a few moments ago, I did my best to give him some advice. I now wonder whether he will reciprocate and give me some advice. In three or four minutes, I must decide whether we run on beyond 1 o'clock, and continue until quarter-past 1. In his opinion, should we finish at 1 o'clock, or should we continue until quarter-past 1 and finish our consideration of the Bill? If he decides that we shall finish at 1 o'clock, and must meet on another day, will he kindly finish his speech at about one minute to 1 o'clock, to allow the promoter of the Bill to move an Adjournment motion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee; I hope that it will acknowledge that I have by no means deliberately slowed down proceedings this morning. I do not feel that I could do justice to the serious points that I still want to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
make in the space of 17 minutes or so. I apologise to the Committee for that, but it is more important that we do the Bill justice.<br><br>
Bearing in mind your second question, Dr. Clark, asking me to stop in about—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two more minutes, perhaps.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Lady's intervention was on target. If she bears with me, I shall clarify my point.<br><br>
Since 1973, claimants for compensation under the land compensation code have been entitled to request advance payment on account of 90 per cent, of agreed compensation, or, more usually, of the acquiring authority's inital estimate of their entitlement. I make that point only by way of an analogy of an advance payment, and am not suggesting that land is involved in this case.<br><br>
Hon. Members may be aware that it can take months, sometimes years, to achieve a final settlement in land compensation cases. Under the land compensation code, provision is therefore made for advance down payment of a stated proportion, usually of the acquiring authority's initial estimate of entitlement. That is a convenient point for me to pause.</span></p>
