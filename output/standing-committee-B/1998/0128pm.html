	<div class='clause'>Clause 3</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>THE GENERAL DUTY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>Amendment proposed [	<i>this day</i>] No. 115, in page 3, line 6, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'provided that such arrangements shall not create a competitive disadvantage by applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions or impose supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to ordinary usage, have no connection with such arrangements.'.—[	<i>Mr. Jenkin.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I continue, I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Brien. I have benefited from your experience and knowledge in the local government arena and from your persistent questions and challenges that you have posed to this Government and the previous Government on the treatment of local government. I hope that we do not provoke you too much so that you wish to be on the Floor of the Committee rather than in the Chair. I know that you will deal with us fairly and rigorously, and that is what we are trying to do with best value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All best value authorities will know that over a five-year period they will need to reach efficiency and quality targets that are determined by the best of their peers. They will not be able to meet that challenge if they knowingly put potential service providers at a competitive disadvantage by treating them unfairly or by putting unreasonable obstacles in their way. If they do so, the robust system that we are creating of both annual and periodic scrutiny by auditors and inspectors will find them out. The previous CCT regime often failed to do that, as the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) admitted. I took his admittance as recognition that CCT had not worked as effectively as the previous Government expected it to and that its time had come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seems to suggest that some authorities may seek to build extraneous features into contracts that will make compliance unduly difficult. I understand that concern. It may be related, as the hon. Member for north Essex said, to the provisions of clause 17 which will allow the Government to provide that specified matters cease to be non-commercial considerations for the purposes of part II the Local Government Act 1988. But Government amendment No. 65 will allow us to issue guidance to best
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
value authorities under clause 17 about the manner in which they take account of non-commercial matters in the exercise of their functions. The guidance will make it clear that non-commercial matters will be taken account of only in a manner that facilitates and is consistent with the achievement of best value. I favour such a permissive approach over the more prescriptive one on which the amendment is based.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mole Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the Minister with interest, but I know from experience that the ingenuity of local government is considerable. The variations on a theme that it can achieve are legendary. I remain concerned that clause 17 will allow local government to slip one past the Government, if the Committee will excuse what is almost a rugby phrase. Many district auditors and those working on behalf of them are also vulnerable to persuasion—I mean this in the nicest way—that what local authorities are doing is fair and right. Will the Secretary of State monitor the contacts or carry out spot checks on all or some of them to ensure that there is agreement about the fact that the law has been followed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should warn the hon. Gentleman that those of us who come from the north-east of England, as I do, are not familiar with allusions to rugby. Most of us who are brought up there think that the ball is wrongly shaped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Curry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Skipton and Ripon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Minister aware that Newcastle has an extremely good rugby union team?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that. I keep a careful eye on anything that comes from Newcastle, especially on the chairmen of the football club and the rugby union club. Rugby is played in the north-east, but it is not a tradition there. It is certainly not a tradition in the state education system, although it may be in other parts of the education system, a few examples of which have crept into the north-east. The hon. Gentleman should use allusions that are familiar to football supporters rather than rugby supporters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's comments, but he should face the fact that when he was a Minister he and the previous Government were not successful in the respect that he mentioned. Far too often, the adversarial approach meant that the brightest and best were encouraged to avoid or to get round the rigid rules of CCT. That is why our proposal is driven by a desire to examine outcomes, outputs and results, and by a need not to be ideological about the manner in which that is done, although we are tough about getting the best outcomes for local people. That means that any authority that seeks to duck and dive will, at the end of the day, be found out—its behaviour will be clear in the outcomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would turn around that arrangement and return us to an unsatisfactory system in which civil servants would have to spend an inordinate length of time trying to check individual contracts. Even if one supported that approach—Labour Members do not—one must accept that it simply did not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
Our approach is the most constructive way forward. It creates a general duty of best value which is framed in terms that will give best value authorities discretion and flexibility in the way that they meet it. Our system is backed up by clear standards and targets and it involves an effective and transparent system of scrutiny. It puts the onus on best value authorities to deliver results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must show that we are not wedded to the old mentalities that beset CCT and that we are prepared to trust local government and to put the interests of local communities above ideology and vested interests. Where that can be done, the legal framework will be designed to facilitate the situation, and where it cannot be done, I am confident that a proper range of options is available to tackle the problem. I therefore urge the hon. Member for North Essex to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Essex)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join in welcoming you, Mr. O'Brien, to the Committee, you join us for what may turn out to be a seminal discussion. I thought that we should have a 15-minute conversation about the amendment—I did not think that there would be a great issue about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised that the Minister expressed surprise at my raising the issue of European Community law. That exposed two things. First, she had obviously forgotten that European Community law applies extensively to the contracting relationships of local authorities and, indeed, to other relationships that may not be overtly contractual. Secondly none of her officials and advisers—of whom I make no personal criticism—drew her attention to the fact that the amendment's wording is taken from article 85 of the treaty of Rome, which has been around for a bit, and that it is germane to the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was really teasing the hon. Gentleman, who, much of the time, has rejected anything that has ever come out of Europe. I, therefore, welcome the fact that he recognises such documents,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that intervention was fully in order, and that it is, therefore, in order for me to reply to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is mistaken to say that I have rejected everything that has come out of the European Union. I am sure that she would not wish to mislead the Committee. I have always been in favour of European Union membership and the Single European Act. However, I have also always believed that we should explain openly the obligations contained in the treaties. Clearly, the Minister's officials did not discuss them with her, and failed to give guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even more surprising was her response that the amendment is not good policy. The amendment represents European Union law as it stands. The Minister shakes her head, but will she explain? The relevant articles have what is termed direct applicability and direct effect which means that our own courts—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister accepts that, why is she saying that the provisions contained in those articles should not be reflected in the Bill at this point? She seemed to say that that would be bad policy, and that the provisions interfere in some way with her policy of best value. I should be delighted if she would explain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to intervene because the hon. Gentleman is simply trying, unsuccessfully, to be clever. I made it absolutely clear this morning that the whole of the Bill will of course be subject to European Community law. I also said that the particular way in which the hon. Gentleman seeks to amend the clause was not helpful, was unnecessary, and would not ensure that we achieve our aim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two complaints about the Minister's intervention. First, her comment that the legislation will, of course, be subject to European Community law is, if I may say so, a bit of a cop out. We could legislate that the moon is made of blue cheese, but we would stiil be subject to European Community law. The challenge for UK legislators, which includes us as well as her, is to ensure that the provisions of European Community law are correctly expressed in domestic law, so that we do not mislead local authorities and others into pursuing relationships and activities that in fact contravene European Community law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the Conservative Government's experience of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981. Under challenge from the courts and the Minister's friends in the trade unions, we had endlessly to reinterpret them. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I hear words of assent from the Minister, who seems to be saying that it was somehow all our fault. I should point out to her, and to her party, that they may be making the same mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter goes to the heart of the Bill. The Minister should provide an exposition of the European Community treaties and the list of directives that have implications for the Bill. What is the relationship of these directives with this new process called best value? Under competitive tendering there was a clear contractor-lessee split or an enabler-provider split. There was an independent, contractual relationship between a public corporation or authority and an economic activity. Clearly the provisions of European Community law applying to such contracts applied in that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that my amendment would take us back to that adversarial position—I am paraphrasing her—but there is no reference in the Bill to contracting an open competitive tender. Clearly we regard that as a shortcoming. But the Minister's intention may be to blur the distinction between state activities and economic activities undertaken by private companies and then perhaps to get out from underneath the obligations that apply. That will be rather difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0779">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
I refer to a useful book that I recommend her to look at, "Law and Institutions of the European Union", Sixth Edition, by D. Lasok. In the chapter "Competition practices contrary to article 85" there is a section on public undertakings, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Member States of the Union practise a 'mixed economy' in which the State participates alongside the private interest."</p></blockquote>
That clearly applies in the case of best value. It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the state controls the 'public sector' in which it operates through public undertakings of different types … They exhibit, however, a common tendency towards monopolies and in that sense enjoy by law a 'dominant position' which the Union purports to contain within the concept of the Common Market."</p></blockquote>
It is referring to activities that may or may not be undertaken by the state, which are incorporated in the provisions of the Common Market, to which there is a specific reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key case was as early as 1997, the van Ameyde 	<i>v.</i> UCI case, which was heard by the European Court of Justice. In that case an employment exchange, which we might regard as a purely state activity—a jobcentre—was characterised as an undertaking because
	<br><blockquote><p>"finding people jobs is an economic activity; and the fact that such an activity is normally entrusted to a public service does not affect the economic nature of the activity since it is not always and not necessarily carried on by a public body."</p></blockquote>
Virtually any local authority activity, such as emptying dustbins, cleaning streets, providing computer services or management services, might be termed an economic activity and therefore could be included in the provisions of the Common Market. There is, therefore necessarily a relationship between those who are commissioning the services and those who are providing them. Unless we make that clear at this stage of the Bill, we care complicit in trying to defy the spirit of the European Community legislation and trying to blur the distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know what one of the major motivations of the abolition of competitive tendering is all about and why so many local authorities—local authorities very much dominated by the Minister's party—have sought to subvert the spirit of competitive tendering and to get round its provisions. It is because they want the producer interest to be dominant. The spirit of the Common Market is to put the consumer and the customer at the heart of the process rather than the producer interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Jon Owen Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As is best value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the sincerely held beliefs of the Minister for Local Government and Housing and what she has said about putting targets, the customer, the council tax payer and performance indicators at the heart of the Bill. I hear that it may be a much tougher regime in many respects than competitive tendering ever was. That is the way in which the hon. Lady is selling it to us this afternoon, which suggests that all the extra powers given to the Secretary of State in the Bill will be used with a vengeance on all those local authorities. I expect that there will be vengeance if those local authorities continue to embarrass the Minister's party in the way that they have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
If the powers are to be used in such a way, we shall be delighted, but it must be clearly set out in the Bill that we see the relationships between services and those who have an obligation to provide them as contractual. The relationships should be open and should be governed by the fairness embodied in our amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to give us more explanation of the sort of legal advice that the Committee needs to make a proper judgment about the Bill, because, as she rightly says, we are legislating in the framework of a great deal of European legislation and European Community case law. Unless we are certain that we are legislating securely in that framework, I fear that the Bill will suffer from many of the problems that we had, for example on the transfer of undertakings from the acquired rights directive. It is incumbent on the Committee to demand that clear and unequivocal advice, and I ask the Minister to give it to the Committee now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I find it rather unsatisfactory that we are being asked to decide on this matter when the Minister has given a completely unsatisfactory response.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Committee, Mr. O'Brien. It is intriguing, because the last time that you and I faced one another in a Committee, in a slightly different atmosphere, you were sitting in the seat that I am sitting in and doing your best to tie me in knots at every opportunity. In your present rather delightful situation you have to sit and smile, benevolently I hope, on the proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are probing, almost fishing, amendments to give the Minister an opportunity to expand on the thinking behind the provision and on the nature of the consultation—for example, who she will consult, and why she will consult in certain ways and in certain areas of the community and not in others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A sort of early warning was given about all this. One thing that I remember from local government—I understand that it is considerably worse these days—is that it is statutorily obliged to do a large part of its consulting. There is some concern about overkill, a point that I touched on during Second Reading. I pointed out that while all of us accept that consultation is important— even vital—and has to be succinct, meaningful and have genuine purpose, it must not overload the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, looking at matters from the viewpoint of local government, there is a temptation to argue that in this best value Bill the Government have gone over the top. I gave an example of a London council consulting on its duties, saying that as a best value authority it will need to consult residents, service users, tenant groups, residents groups, businesses, neighbouring councils, the Government Office for London, diocesan boards, health authorities, public unit companies, the Department of Social Security, professional groups and, presumably, somewhere along the line, the private sector, if it is appropriate for the particular service. The list could be expanded
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
considerably, and I suspect that some local authorities, in doing their duty on the duties, may feel that expansion is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the beleaguered residents of the London borough that I have chosen would also have to be consulted by the borough, the police, the fire and civil defence authority, the development agency and, after this morning, the waste disposal authority, Transport for London, and, later, the mayor and the Greater London authority—and the list probably does not end there. But all that is about only the duties; it is not about the quality of the services that will be provided. That comes next. There is the best value performance plan for each financial year, with each plan being published before the next financial year. Hence the data will be based on the previous financial year, so will effectively be about 18 months out of date when it eventually hits the decks for the public who have been consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be realistic, the data has to be detailed and voluminous—therefore, for most of the public, it is impenetrable. As I said on Second Reading, I cannot imagine the ordinary resident putting up with it for long. Instead of reacting to it, people will file it in one of those bins for collection and disposal later. I also said that there will, of course, be the odd resident—"odd" being the operative word—who will react.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We talked earlier about easing the load on local authorities at the bottom end of the financial scale. My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) suggested looking at different ways of approaching this, rather than giving a figure. He was leading on to the opportunity that exists for the Government to change their approach and reduce the load on local government. We can consider a reduction here, even by amalgamating some consultations to reduce the plethora of consultation paper anticipation responses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, there is already a sign of what I call consultation fatigue. It comes principally from the busy business world, which is already being loaded with consultation documents and papers from local government, Uncle Tom Cobbleigh and all, including health authorities and so on. Business is not responding, so is missing some of the vital points. Companies receiving these large documents, which, to be fair they would need to receive to examine a service in detail, will bin the fifth and sixth when they land on desks because they will not have time to examine them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me further is that the nature of the consultation will allow some local authorities to cover for themselves. We have to accept that, at the bottom end of the scale—there must be a scale of quality, so there must be a bottom end—the opportunity will arise for local authorities to use this intense and overburdening consultation to cover up poor quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The benchmarking is set up in such a way that there will be an inevitable tendency to average down. We will have what I call the Oblivon effect. When I first arrived in this country Oblivon was a pharmaceutical prescription drug that we used for concerned patients. It was a beautiful, almost glass-like, soft jube, I think the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0781">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
Australians call them, filled with a drug that was supposed to calm patients. We used to give it to the patients with a large patter; they would swallow it and it would work in 15 minutes. Pharmaceutically, however, it was useless. It did not work and so was withdrawn. If we give residents volumes of glossy consultation papers telling them that they are getting a wonderful service without testing it, they will experience the Oblivon effect. We can see this already today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next factor to consider and this goes back to what my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon touched on this morning, is the cost. For many local authorities, particularly the smaller ones, the cost of this consultation exercise right across the board, as a proportion of its net revenue budget, could hurt its financial budget. The money that will be spent could be better spent elsewhere if the consultation was rationalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister also explain the thinking behind the organisations she is consulting? To give her a tiny example, under the duties the local council tax payers are consulted. That is right and proper. But, they are apparently not consulted about the service they have paid for and its quality. I am sure that there is an opportunity to combine some of these consultations to reduce the process and make it succinct but still meaningful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sometimes think that if we are not careful everyone will spend so much time consulting that we will never get round to doing anything. I am rather sceptical about this mania for consultation. But there again, I am deeply sceptical about the mania for open government too, so I declare myself an unrepentant reactionary before anyone accuse me of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am always anxious to find out what happens. It is all very well to have these vague phrases but I always ask myself: at 9 o'clock on Monday morning, who does what, with what purpose and for how long? These consultations cover an enormously general category of people. Subsection (2)(d) refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"representatives of persons appearing to the authority to have an interest in any area within which the authority carries out functions."</p></blockquote>
That is colossally open-ended. How does the authority decide who has a legitimate right? Is there a right to be consulted. Could a body demand that it be consulted. To what extent does it make the selection?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of us sit on Select Committees. We choose which witnesses will give oral evidence and which will give written evidence. There is no way that we could listen to everyone's case if it were given orally. We also know that when vast volumes of consultation are received, although it may be ploughed through by some poor and very junior official, only the baldest summary reaches the Executive or ministerial level. I do not know whether practices have changed since my time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is about to go through the rate support grant settlement. She knows that she is supposed to see vast quantities of representations from local authorities from all over the country. They used to wheel them through in a trolley. Has a trolley been wheeled through her office yet to enable her to see the consultations? Nobody ever pretended that for every district council the Minister would listen in rapt attention to details concerning the length of roads or the gritting requirements of shire authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
Practical questions pertain here. Who in the local authority would the Minister expect to be charged with responsibility? If it is to be someone spared from doing anything else to do with consultation, it will be at a junior level. Who will read it? What does a consultation have to be to qualify as a consultation? Could it be an advert in the local paper or a questionnaire? In local authorities with large ethnic minorities—many of the inner London authorities or Bradford, for example—will consultation be carried out in a variety of languages, which will add to the cost of the procedure? No one would say that he is against consultation a priori, but we must be sure about what tasks are to be imposed on the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am tempted, but I will not join my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley. I recognise that local authorities must know what their local people want since many of them may have sensible views about achieving it. However, I want to ensure that the exercise does not become a time-consuming, costly rigmarole which may become a bureaucratic imposition with no real substance. Nor do I want consultation to become a formality, perfunctory in its nature, merely to satisfy the Bill's requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister give us an example of what she would regard as a legitimate series of consultations, so we could gain some sense of feeling about what is required? That would be of great benefit to all of us. It would also be helpful if she could explain subsection (2)(d). Will she also clarify what she means by representatives? I am always suspicious of them. The world is full of self-appointed representatives who represent nobody but themselves yet are often appointed to high offices by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Plaskitt 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warwick and Leamington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can help the right hon. Gentleman. Warwickshire county council in my constituency is a pilot authority for best value, it has carried out its consultation exercise. It involved 60 public, statutory, community and voluntary sector organisations; all the council's partner agencies, and every household in the county.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in that. It was a pilot, but will that be extrapolated into all best value processes? We should remember that reviews are supposed to be continuous. Subsection (1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A best value authority must make arrangements to secure continuous improvement in the way in which its functions are exercised".</p></blockquote>
I accept that the pilot may have been valuable. In north Yorkshire the county is consulting on increasing its council tax by an additional 3 per cent. above the Government guidelines because of the hopeless inadequacy of the settlement. The Minister and I have already had an exchange on that and we will doubtless do so again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know the quality and the width of consultation. I want to know its substance. I also caution the Minister again to be careful about representatives. As I said, the world is full of self-appointed ones, from the head of the supporters' club of Newcastle United—in dire need at the moment—to members of the Consumer Association. I hope that the Minister will help us on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Hayes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Holland and The Deepings)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak to the amendments and, in particular, about already existing arrangements which oblige consultation for some authorities that are going to be appointed as best value authorities. I want to deal with the police authorities in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under section 36 of the Police Act 1996, the Home Secretary has a general duty to exercise his powers
	<br><blockquote><p>"in such a manner and to such an extent as appears to him to be best calculated to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the police."</p></blockquote>
Already, that throws up a concern about conflict—or at least a sharp contrast—between the powers and statutory responsibilities of the Home Secretary to provide an effective, efficient and appropriate service, and the powers that the Bill would confer on the Secretary of State. The Minister will no doubt want to comment on that, because the contradiction permeates the entire Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, section 96 of the Police Act 1996, replacing section 106 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, requires each police area to make arrangements
	<br><blockquote><p>"for obtaining—
	<ol>
	<li>the views of people in that area about matters concerning the policing of the area, and</li>
	<li>their co-operation with the police in preventing crime in that area."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
Inevitably, that will overlap significantly with the consultation under the Bill. Are we to believe that there will be two separate sets of consultation between the public and their representatives with respect to the policing of an area? Do the proposals in the Bill replace the current arrangements? 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister shakes her head and makes dismissive comments, but the position has not been made clear either in the explanatory notes or in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the informed press dealing with police matters— which I guess the Minister does not read—there has been some commentary about the problem of a contradiction between existing law and the Bill. Some concerns have been expressed about pressure on the independence of chief constables in dealing with operational matters. It is hard to separate best value criteria and appropriate performance targets from operational considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, a problem arises in the potential for damage to constabulary independence. You will know, Mr. O'Brien, of the extensive library of information that exists on the threat of the nationalisation of the police; the idea of creating a national police force conforming to common standards and centrally managed. I am concerned that the Bill, and particularly the additional requirement for consultation, takes us towards that, duplicates existing good practice in most of the country and does nothing for the quality of local policing or the morale of our excellent police forces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to pursue the sensible comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon about amendment No. 116. I should like practical examples of how the relevant provision will work. In my county of Shropshire a consultation process is under way because of the miserable local government settlement which has required the Liberal-Labour regime to consult around the county
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
about whether the council tax should be increased by 5 per cent., 9.9 per cent.—the council's favoured solution—or 15 per cent. At the first meeting four people turned up, one of which had a complaint about the council, which he said had dumped gravel on his drive. At the next meeting, 25 turned up. I understand that the next was slightly better attended, with 30 or 40 people present. Is that a satisfactory consultation process? Does that show that the people of Shropshire are interested? I think that they expect their elected representatives, whom they put in power, to make decisions and to present themselves at election time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that unless we pass amendment No. 116, we shall be demeaning the role of a councillor. What is the point of putting oneself up for election, on a platform, with a programme and a set position on council tax, and then having to run round the county for every contract? We have heard from Warwickshire about the consultation of 60 organisations and every household. Will that happen every time waste disposal is put out to tender, or there is a change in the regime of the fire service? It is simply not practical and people do not want it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the public. They do not want to be consulted and bothered with bits of paper. They will not reply. They want responsible councillors to present a serious programme at election, and then to implement that programme. Councillors with successful programmes will be re-elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation process undermines the principles of local democracy and shows that the Liberal-Labour regime is ducking its responsibilities. It is an enormously expensive exercise, costing Shropshire £5,000 on its council tax. I therefore strongly support amendment No. 116.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reminded of a speech delivered by the late, lamented Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman talking about his dad, David Jenkin?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am referring to the right hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson), not ancestors and forebears. Some time before his elevation to the Cabinet, the right hon. Gentleman made a speech in which he said that the era of representative democracy was drawing to a close and that we were moving into a new period in which democracy would take place through the internet, consultations and focus groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government ignore the elected representatives of the House, as far as they can, and attempt to have a direct relationship with the people, calling themselves a people's Government. They operate focus groups, which is absolutely right, as modern political parties must be sensitive to public opinion. However, the Government seem to be confused about accountability that bypasses the democratically elected representatives of Parliament. That is reflected in their abuse of the referendum. They
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0783">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
are resisting recommendations from the Select Committee on Trade and Industry that referendums should be regulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must, therefore, be sceptical about the nature and purpose of consultation. Amendment No. 116 is linked to amendment Nos. 119 and 122. If consultation is to take place, we must be clear what we are consulting on. Amendment No. 116 would remove consultation on duties, which, as the Minister explained, are absolute. We sympathise with her objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3(2) raises the matter of
	<br><blockquote><p>"how to fulfil the duty".</p></blockquote>
That puts the cart before the horse. Amendment No. 122 proposes that the Secretary of State consult the authorities on their performance targets and objectives. His guidance—not orders—should be issued after consultation with those who will have to put it into effect. The consultation between best value authorities and others should concern the application of guidance. It should concern the application of objectives to performance criteria, not woolly ideas on applying the broad objectives of efficiency, effectiveness and economy. Such consultation would be more beneficial for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall raise a further matter now to save time when we come to debate amendment No. 23.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under amendment No. 122, proposed new subsection (7)(e) of clause 4 would ensure consultation with,
	<br><blockquote><p>"employees of the best value authority who are or may be affected by the arrangements".</p></blockquote>
It is ironic that that category is left out of the statutory provisions for consultation. I would be interested in the Minister's explanation of that. It is unwise to exclude that category because of European Community law, and the directives on the transfer of undertakings. The original directive applied to,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the transfer of an undertaking, business or part of a business to another employer as a result of a legal transfer or merger".</p></blockquote>
In our previous debate, we established that that applies to the undertakings that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the transferor and the transferee are required to inform the representatives of their respective employees of the reasons for the transfer The information must be provided and consultations take place in good time before the change in the business is effected."</p></blockquote>
Local authorities that fail to consult their employees will be in breach of the directive on undertakings. Yet the Bill does not specify that consultations with employees should take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would provide a better consultation structure. As my right hon. Friend the Minister for Skipton put it, about what will a local authority consult if not about ways of achieving the detailed performance criteria? Should not the Secretary of State be obliged to consult local authorities before setting the criteria? Will the criteria simply be imposed on local authorities with no obligation to consult? That would be in keeping with the Bill. Perhaps it is yet another characteristic of the Government that the Minister is reluctant to explain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members have been round the houses. The hon. Member for Mole Valley said that the amendments were probing and somewhat
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
mischievous. The clause intends to ensure that local authorities consult the people for whom they are responsible—their constituents, the public—about the duty of best value. I enjoyed hearing Conservative Members claim that the duty to consult the public was outside their comprehension. That shows the difference between the Government and the Opposition. The quality and value of our public services is enhanced when the public believe that they are at the centre of local authorities' consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way now. I did not intervene in Conservative Members' speeches. The hon. Gentleman can return to the point when I have finished my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove the requirement in clause 3 to consult service users and local taxpayers, and replace it with a refined version that would include an obligation in clause 4 to consult elected members and employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who should best value authorities consult? Amendment No. 122 would add employees of best value authorities to the list. Local Government White Papers in England and Wales made it equally clear that properly trained and well motivated work forces have an important role in best value. I accept what the hon. member for Mole Valley said about TUPE. Indeed, I referred to that earlier. We expect best value pilots to pay proper regard to work forces. We also expect statutory guidance on consultation to address the manner in which best value authorities ensure that staff currently delivering services have an opportunity to play an active role in the delivery of best value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That said, one of the underlying principles of best value is the statutory obligation of best value authorities to consult those people who use, pay for or are directly affected by the services that they provide—in other words, the general public, the citizenry. Their interests must be paramount and outweigh the vested interests of others, however important, including those who are employed to provide services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 122 also suggests that best value authorities should consult elected members of the authority. That betrays a lack of understanding of what consultation is designed to achieve under best value. Both the Green and White Papers in England and Wales made it clear that consultation is designed to inform the strategic choices that authorities make about how and at what level they exercise their functions. Those strategic choices must, in the first instance, be largely determined by members whose role is to give leadership and direction to the work of the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) heard that explanation. We are enhancing local democratic structures, not tearing them down. Given that, it seems odd to provide that members who play a pivotal role in such strategic decisions should be under an obligation to consult. If nothing else, that would add an extra layer of unnecessary bureaucracy which we would do well to avoid. It would also suggest that hon. Members
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0784">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
see the duty of best value as being another technical device. It is not a technical device. Best value is about producing a change of culture in authorities which will expose them to the public instead of allowing them to concentrate their activity in the town or county hall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue is to consider the practical effect on the legal framework of removing from clause 3 a requirement to consult on the general duty of best value, as amendment No. 116 would do, and to replace it with one placed in the context of performance indicators in clause 4, as amendments Nos. 119 and 122 would do. There is no doubt in my mind that that would be a retrograde step. We have carefully placed the duty of consultation in clause 3 to ensure that local people are given a voice in the crucial decisions that affect the strategic direction of the authority and the way in which it goes about fulfilling the duty of best value in broad terms. Removing that provision from its current place in the Bill might restrict the influence that local people could exert over the way in which their local authority went about setting its organisational goals. That is hardly conducive to local accountability and is at odds with our wider aim of bringing authorities closer to the communities that they serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also see little merit in the proposed change to clause 4 as set out in amendment No. 122. The amendment would require authorities to consult in a manner that is consistent with the broad provisions of clause 3, albeit with a view to ensuring that the approach of setting performance indicators is consistent with the requirements of the duty of best value. That is satisfactorily achieved in clause 4(3)(a).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I circulated yesterday to members of the Committee background papers to assist them in their deliberations. I appreciate that hon. Members may not have had the opportunity fully to go through those, but I invite them to consider the report on and summary of a research project on public participation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw hon. Members' attention to those parts of the report that show that participation is not as Opposition Members described it. Consultation now involves much more than simply holding public meetings. I often speak to councillors and officers in local government, and if anyone tries to persuade me that they have consulted effectively by holding a public meeting, I say, "well, try again." I know only too well from my own experience that that can be the least effective way to consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report on the way that local government and local services are perceived, which includes research that was commissioned by the previous Administration, shows that local people want to be more involved and that they want to have more—and more effective—consultation. The report helps to identify how more effective consultation might be carried out, and it recognises that it is silly for central Government to prescribe the nature of consultation. Consultation should vary according to the nature of the service and to the nature of the locality in
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
which that service is provided. That system is simple and straightforward, and I assure Committee members that we are not seeking to be devious or over-bureaucratic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key element that the report establishes is that authorities have to take strategic decisions about consultation. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Participation methods range from the 'cheap and cheerful' to the elaborate and expensive. It is always possible to find one that matches the issue at hand given the constraints of context and budget."</p></blockquote>
The key challenge is strategic selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not yet addressed the fundamental question of how the new proposals interface with current statutory requirements to consult. She may be about to do so, in which case I apologise for intervening. I appreciate that many local authorities consult voluntarily. I take a slightly different view from one or two of my hon. Friends, in that I think that some consultation is quite positive. How do the proposals interface with existing statutory obligations to consult with best value authorities, which are currently obliged to go through such a process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Authorities have to use common sense. The Bill does not say, "You must consult in this way on that aspect." It simply says, "You must consult." A statutory consultation might be carried out, and a proper view might be reached, but the authority might want to do something else. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon alluded to the fact that consultation might involve a pressure group that did not in any way represent the public's view. The report states that if an authority consults representatives, it must be sure that they are truly representative. We should credit local councils with a bit of common sense. That is why we are making the Bill more flexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals will not involve a consultation process that is over-prescriptive, over-bureaucratic or, quite honestly, useless. Consultation will be effective, and the public will know that their contribution is critical to the way in which an authority pursues its duties. I urge the Opposition to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather disappointed. The Minister has taken the amendments and the thinking behind them as a vicious attack. In fact, they are meant to be helpful. I recognise that she has given members of the Committee the research document, which I have yet to receive—it is probably waiting for me in my office. We have given her an opportunity to expand on the Government's thinking, to explain why particular groups were chosen and how we can anticipate some local authorities taking the wide spectrum of the Bill too far through fear of offending its provisions. She has been given the opportunity to give a more careful explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon outlined the skeleton of what local authorities will think when they get in at 9 o'clock on a Monday morning and are faced with the Act, which they have to get on with. They will be bemused and some will deliberately go over the top, especially when it comes to the review stage. This point is relevant to clauses 3 and 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend suppose that best value will apply to the function of consulting? Unless best value is carried out effectively, efficiently and economically, it will not fulfil the object of best value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we should leave the CCT legislation in place for that aspect of consultation so that it is carried out properly and efficiently by a specialist organisation. I must be cautious. I have great admiration for more than 90 per cent, of councillors. Far and away most councillors and councils be have in the traditional spirit of local government, but a few do not. One of our concerns about best value is that it should drive the standard up, not average it out or average it down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill makes it possible, if not likely, that some incompetent authorities will find reasons and excuses not to raise their standards. For example, many of inner London's authorities have similar problems. They are required to produce similar services, but have distinctly different ways in which they provide them, resulting in different qualities and costs. Poorer authorities will use the consultation as an opportunity to cover their back, and that is not a rugby term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need better clarification so that we can understand more fully and I am sure that we will need to return to this matter. I am afraid that the aggression of the answer, when there was a request for clarification—not so much for the Committee but for local government—was an exceptionally poor response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am determined not to be drawn into saying what is and is not acceptable, because it is not for me to say. The issue must be sorted out locally. I am not going to sit in Whitehall and judge what every authority in this country is doing. Authorities must decide what is acceptable and they must meet the strictures of best value.

I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Brien. I hope that you do not think that Liberal Democrats are usually silent for the first hour or so of the Committee. We simply felt that we should allow the previous debate to run its course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, with which we will try to deal briefly, seeks to include employees in the list of consultees. I accept that employees could be included under subsection (2) (d), but they do not have to be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier today, the Minister spoke of the importance of treating fairly those who deliver the service. However, unlike many other people, the clause does not specifically require employees to be consulted. Unlike others such as those who could use a service but do not, perhaps because they are unaware of it or do not need it, employees are a clearly identifiable group who are therefore easy to consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People on the front line of service delivery often have a valuable insight into the service, and can often suggest innovative ways of delivering service. Like businesses, most local authorities have suggestion boxes employees to put forward ideas on how services could be improved and money saved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The view of the employee is not the only one, and perhaps not the most important one, but it should certainly be taken into account. The Government appeared to recognise that in their Green Paper, although that recognition was toned down a bit by the time we got to the White Paper. It has now disappeared altogether from the Bill. However, the Bill makes frequent mention of business, and I am worried that the Government are seeking totally to distance themselves from employees in future, and get into bed with their friends in business. I look forward to the Minister's explanation of why employees have been excluded from the list of people that authorities will have a duty to consult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you know, Mr. O'Brien, I dealt with the matter during our consideration of the previous group of amendments, one of which was similar in nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is simple: the duty of best value is to the citizen and the public. As I said, we accept that, in meeting the duty of best value, an authority should properly involve its work force. I do not believe that any good company could do so without involving its work force. However, as I also said, the primacy of the public should not be outweighed by any vested interest, however important or central it may be to the delivery of best value. The interests of the general public must be paramount. For that reason I cannot support the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0786">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
We are talking about the duty of best value—a duty owed by the council, including employees and councillors, to the public. Consulting employees in that respect places them outside the authority in terms of their responsibility to deliver best value. I cannot express strongly enough the fact that this duty is owed to the public: we cannot and will not move to include others in a more primary way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister when she says that the primary duty is to the public. The clause lists people who pay council tax and people who have an interest in the authority's area as those who should be consulted. I contend that including employees in that list would not raise them above the public but would put them among those people who have an interest in delivering the best quality and best value services. I cannot understand why the Minister is so reluctant to include them—I am not talking about raising them above the public, only about including them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may well continue to disagree about this. Many employees will be residents and members of other organisations: in those respects they will be consulted. We need to be sure that their role as employees is a proper one. In order to deliver the duty of best value, any authority will have to involve its employees—more than just consulting them—in a real way. However, that does not mean that they have to be part of the duty that is owed to the public, which confuses matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I resist the amendment and ask the hon. Lady to withdraw it. As I pointed out this morning, employees will play a full part in the delivery without being tagged on to the public, which confuses the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening to the debate with interest and believe that the Minister is on strong ground, given that the Committee has decided to leave aside the consultation on how precisely to fulfil the duty. In one respect, it would be wrong to consult employees: the exercise is about consulting consumers and council tax payers, not about creating a platform for producer interests or starting a campaign to keep the DSO in the hands of the local authority. If the Minister is serious about cracking down on some of the more recalcitrant Labour authorities, the power will be useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Taunton (Mrs. Ballard) were about consulting not on how to fulfil the duty but on how to satisfy performance criteria and how to deliver, we would support it. Furthermore, I do not understand how a best value authority can have a duty to consult employees who are not directly employed by the authority, as though it were an employer. The obligation to consult relates to the direct employers of such people. Some contractors in this country would be pretty annoyed if their employees suddenly started being consulted directly by local authorities. That would be an interference in their responsibilities. We are inclined to support the Minister on this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It goes beyond that. If an authority were involved in consultation with a party in a dispute between a company and its work force, it would be involved in the dispute. Some fascinating legal arguments, probably in court, might well work to the disadvantage of the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting scenario and possibly a real one. While there was a contractual dispute, the employees of the contractor would have an obligation of confidentiality to the employer and it would be quite wrong for the local authority to have a legal obligation to interfere in that contractual relationship between employer and employee. We do not want to create a platform for producer interest. If the hon. Member for Taunton divides the Committee, we will support the Government against the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think it is creating a platform for producer interests to include employees among those who are to be consulted on how an authority is to achieve continuous improvement in the exercise of its functions.

These are probing amendments which are designed primarily to tease out the Government's view of the role of the Local Government Association as representative of local government in helping them prepare guidance. We believe that statutory guidance on consultation should be kept to a minimum. We have already had some debate about the nature of consultation, the type of consultation that is appropriate in different parts of the country or for different services or groups of users. I would certainly contend that local government in particular areas will always know better than central Government what is the best form of consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0787">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
As the Minister said earlier, good practice guides have already been written on consultation. In common with other members of the Committee I was a member of local authorities for a number of years. I can remember when the local authority of which I was leader first talked about extending consultation beyond the standard public meeting and considered local referendums for example. Conservative councillors would always say, "You were elected and you should make decisions. Why pass the buck to the public?" It took a great deal of argument to persuade them that there was anything worthwhile in consulting the public and finding out their views in between election time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have moved on since those days 10 years ago and the LGA, the Local Government Information Unit and many others, including myself in a modest way, have written useful advice on consultation. One of the tasks of the new local government improvement agency will be to spread good practice in this area. Before issuing guidance on consultation, the LGA as a body that is representative of most tiers of local government should be consulted. Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 are designed to probe the Government on the difference, and this may be a genuine lack of understanding of the terminology, between persons who appear to represent the authority and persons who are representatives of the authority. I should have thought that representatives of the authority were elected representatives but could persons appearing to represent the authority be officers of the authority or some other people? I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 98 is a consequential amendment. Amendment No. 86 probes why new clause 7 does not indicate that the Government should have regard to the outcome of the consultation or at least to give reasons why they are not taking it on board. The Government will probably explain that when they introduce it. This is very important. When anyone consults, they build up an expectation among those being consulted that they will be listened to. Perhaps, unfortunately, the public and others equate being listened to with getting their own way. If, as a result of the consultation process, they do not get what they want, they become cynical, saying, "They didn't listen to us in the first place; what was the point of that consultation?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was in local government I always argued that consulting did not necessarily mean that we did what people wanted us to do. The same applies with the Government, who are now consulting us on our views about the Bill. So far, they are not doing anything that we want them to do. If people who are consulted are not to become cynical and stop bothering to respond, the very least they need is to hear why they are not getting what they want, and a response to their views during consultation. People would be helped by knowing why they were not getting a positive response. The amendment is a probe to discover whether the Government will include in new clause 7 a commitment to reply to the consultation and explain why they were responding negatively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Essex)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We also have amendments in this group. We understand the motivation of the hon. Member for Taunton to place this extra duty
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
to consult the Local Government Association. We take the view that the Secretary of State should be in constant exchange with the LGA; a formal requirement to consult should not be necessary. Perhaps the LGA is pursuing a rather less adversarial role than before 1 May 1997. We welcome that, and assuming that we are in an era of less adversarial roles between local and central Government, we should like that relationship to continue. But I have profound doubts about whether it is necessary to specify that in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments in this group are principally about first, transferring—in the same way as the Liberal Democrats wish to do—the issuing of orders to the issuing of guidance, which we think—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> In fact, I am talking to the wrong group of amendments. I apologise, Mr. O'Brien.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was quite enjoying that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of amendments is connected to guidance under the best value framework. The amendments comprise three main types. Amendments Nos. 24, 25, 26, 86 and 98 are designed to ensure that the Secretary of State consults with the LGA or representatives of local government before issuing guidance. The Government's amendments remove general provisions setting out the Secretary of State's powers to issue guidance to best value authorities on the general duty, best value reviews, local performance plans and transitional arrangements respectively. I thought that the hon. Member for North Essex had risen to welcome them. The provisions are then consolidated in new clause 7, also a Government amendment, which is a new provision that mirrors the provisions abolished by amendments Nos. 51, 52, 53, 58 and 66, and effectively consolidates them into one clause—which deals with powers to issue guidance in respect of all aspects of part I of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would replace the existing provisions of clauses 3(5), 5(8), 6(5), 10(5) and 18(4) although it would be drafted in the same terms as them. This would enable the Secretary of State to pull together issues referring to specific provisions in part I of the Bill such as reviews and plans. Subsection (3) of new clause 7 provides an undertaking by the Secretary of State to consult the Audit Commission before issuing guidance under clause 10 of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause recognises that local authorities need general guidance to be issued in general terms to suggest ways in which they might carry out their functions and not be restricted by the aspect of best value procedures to which they relate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause provides the Secretary of State with the flexibility to issue guidance when required. I therefore urge hon. Members to agree to it. By withdrawing similar provisions on guidance in clauses 3, 5, 6, 10 and 18 and replacing them with one general power of guidance, we have streamlined the Bill's guidance powers and clarified the drafting. I hope that all hon. Members will welcome this change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have taken a power of general guidance covering all aspects of best value in part I, rather than separate powers on different aspects of that process. By doing so,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0788">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
we have recognised the way best value authorities approach best value in the real world. In many cases, they will wish to avoid a fragmented approach when work on performance plans is carried out separately from reviews and without reference to them. Many of them will aim to take an integrated approach, and our guidance must reflect this. It must also take account of important cross-cutting issues, such as equity sustainability, which we have already debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our guidance addresses all these issues, reflects how authorities will act in practice, and improves the drafting of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not support amendments that require consultation with the LGA or representatives of local government. Matters of general consultation are satisfactorily dealt with in Government new clause 7, which provides for consultation with local government representatives. I am anxious that we do not name only the LGA, which was formed after the election, when a number of associations came together. I must tell the hon. Member for Taunton that we would be in deep trouble if the Bill included the LGA, and not the National Association of Local Councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that it would be a good idea for the LGA to subject itself to a best value audit to discover whether it needs its interminable number of committees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not be tempted down that route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall resist amendments that constrain the Secretary of State's ability to consult with individual authorities or groups of authorities. Such amendments are short-sighted, given that, in some cases, the Secretary of State will wish to issue guidance to such groups, and will, of course, wish to consult them about that. Amendments, such as amendment No. 86, that would introduce a requirement to consider consultation when issuing guidance, are unnecessarily bureaucratic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member fro Taunton asked about the term "representatives appearing". It refers to the broadest category of consultees for whom no obvious route or representative emerges. We wished to ensure that the Bill's wording would enable organisations to put forward people who would not necessarily be democratically representative. The hon. Lady asked about having regard to the consultation. That is implicit in the Bill's wording, which, I am assured by my officials means that account must be taken of representations and that failure to do so could lead to judicial review. The word "consultation" implies listening and "having regard to". Therefore, lawyers and drafter believe that the phrase is superfluous. I can see that the hon. Member for Taunton wants to intervene, but I am anxious to move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, there may be one, but most are reluctant. I was a member of an authority that had three simultaneous judicial reviews, and we regretted that bitterly for many reasons. Local authorities would not have to consider such a procedure if the Government published their response to the consultation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are talking at cross purposes. We were discussing local authorities' responsibility to consult. Have I got the wrong bit? We are now considering the next clause—I am sorry.

The Bill covers the hon. Lady's point. We used the normal wording of such measures. I hope that the hon. lady realises that we have to respond, and discuss the way in which we respond. As the right hon. member for Skipton and Ripon said, we shall do that next week in response to consultation on the settlement. If we accepted the amendment, the Bill would be longer and even more complex. We want to avoid that.

Clause 4 also gives the Secretary of State discretion to specify different performance indicators and standards. That seems another unnecessary accumulation of powers.

The true arbiters of that are local authorities in consultation with local people, not the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause gives the Secretary of State powers to specify performance factors and standards. The Association of Direct Labour Organisations and the Local Government Association are concerned that that is too tight. National definition will fail to take account of local difference. National targets are bound to reflect the priorities of central government, which might be different from those of the local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the example of local authority A, which considers 90 per cent, of planning applications in four weeks, but only ensures that 80 per cent, of those eligible for housing benefit receive their full entitlement. Following local consultation—with council tax payers and other interested parties—it is decided to allow the planning target to fall to 80 per cent, to ensure that benefit entitlement reaches 95 per cent. The Secretary of State then sets a national target of 85 per cent, for planning and 98 per cent, for benefit entitlement. The council will thus fail the best value test on both counts and the consultation exercise—having been undertaken at some expense—will prove to have been a waste of time. Local choice will have been replaced by national diktat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee report on best value identified another aspect. It recognised the tension between the need for a strong national framework and a desire for local flexibility and innovation. Wil the Minister explain how she intends to ensure that performance indicators will be relevant and take proper account of differences in local authority circumstances? We do not believe that that can be done without consultation between local government and other bodies. The Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee did not believe that that could be done either. It recommended full consultation between local government, the Audit Commission and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy over national performance indicators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should clarify what performance indicators will be used in the best value framework prior to legislation. Those should be designed to incorporate cost, quality and public expectation and perception measures. Amendment No. 75 would remove the Secretary of State's powers to specify performance indicators and standards by order to allow local authorities the flexibility to reflect local needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our amendment No. 117 is in many respects similar to Liberal Democrat amendment No. 75. It comforted me greatly that the Minister made a similar mistake earlier: we can shake hands across the divide over that. However, we may be kidding ourselves. I have taken legal advice on the legal effect of guidance issued by the Secretary of State and of an order, which is obviously more specific.

When a local authority wilfully defies reasonable guidance by the Secretary of State we should be aware that such guidance could well be used in a court of law and become binding. That underlines the problem of the Bill's structure which, in respect of the powers it confers on the Secretary of State to tell local authorities what to do, is difficult to ameliorate. We should be under no illusions: that is what the Bill is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 120 deals with subsection (2), which allows the Secretary of State to specify different performance indicators or standards for different functions, different authorities and at different times. This is the new aspect of the legislation which people would not expect to find from a decentralising Administration. It gives the widest possible discretion to the Secretary of State to bully some authorities and not others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said on Second Reading that this could be an invitation to cronyism. The danger of this kind of discretion is that authorities will want to keep in with the Secretary of State. They will want to keep in with the officials reporting to the Secretary of State. The officials will make it quite clear to the Secretary of State that they have these people taped and that the local authority is under control and they are not worried about it. An authority that falls out with the officials at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions or the local government office in the area may find the Secretary of State using these powers to apply different criteria to different functions and different authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The history of local government is that some local authorities feel paranoid and picked on and any legislation that looks in any way subjective upsets them. We will see a good version of that on Thursday, as we do every year, when every local authority that gets a poor standard spending assessment feels that it has been picked on and that everything is being regeared for them. I am sure that Wandsworth will complain if it feels that there is a good reason and I suspect that there just could be looking at the way that inner London has been hurt on SSAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not enough</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am ignoring that aside. Subjective appraisal in the legislation is intensely disliked by local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's intervention is extremely apposite. SSAs are constructed on a religiously strict formula. Even then, local authorities feel that the formula is adjusted and tweaked in order to favour some and not others. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, the Government have had two Budgets, two local authority settlements and still Westminster has one of the lowest council taxes in London as does Wandsworth. The twitches from the Government Benches on this question show that the scars run deep.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is scrupulously fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, we will see. This goes to the heart of the issue. In the amplification of performance standards and indicators we will see not a scrupulously fair application but a pick-and-choose law as the framework for the Secretary of State's intervention into the affairs of local authorities. It will not just be into each local authority but into each function of each local authority and at different times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 120 removes that discretion by deleting subsection (2) and replaces it later in the clause with what we think is at least a fairer and more open system of applying this kind of pressure to local authorities. Direct pressure from the Secretary of State is what is being applied to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 123 says that the Secretary of State may issue different guidance to different authorities. But where he does that he must
	<br><blockquote><p>"consult with the authorities concerned"—</p></blockquote>
which seems fair and must provide reasons for the different guidance and
	<br><blockquote><p>"arrange for that guidance to be published."</p></blockquote>
We are in the era of open government and it would be helpful perhaps—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Irony never works in Parliament, does it? I should say that this Government say that we are in the era of open government. It would be nice to think that this kind of information will be readily available to readily published. Perhaps the Minister could respond to that point. We think it particularly important that there should be openness in all matters where the Secretary of State has such wide discretionary powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 124 expands the problem that the Minister singularly failed to cover earlier. I wonder whether it will be fruitful to try to have another debate on this topic. The amendment lists the major EC laws that have considerably influenced the atmosphere surrounding contracting for public services between local authorities and their contractual providers. I refer the Committee to the extracts from the legal text book that I read out earlier. Contracts can be deemed to exist between two entities owned by a public authority, where a public authority has a relationship with what we call a public undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no idea from the Minister's explanation—I am genuinely seeking ministerial advice on this question—how the directives and the regulations that flow from them will apply to the best value procedure. We think that, for the avoidance of doubt, all these measures should be specified in the Bill as applicable and the Minister should explain how they are applicable, because, whether or not they are in the Bill, they are applicable. It is not good enough for the Minister to say "We don't need to worry about how it will work, because they are applicable. We shall just let the authorities get into their judicial reviews", which are so loved and hated by the hon. Member for Taunton. We should make it clear that these issues are extremely important and central to the process of best value, unless the Bill is about trying to abolish the relationship between contractors and enablers that is evident in existing competitive tendering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0791">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
Amendment No. 125 seeks to leave out subsection (4), which contains two extraordinarily strong lines of legislation. They read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In exercising a function a best value authority must meet any applicable performance standard specified under subsection (1)(b)."</p></blockquote>
The Bill places an absolute, legal obligation to meet performance standards. In that respect it is every bit as draconian as competitive tendering, and probably more so, because competitive tendering applied only to a limited number of local authority functions. The obligation to meet the performance standards set down by the Secretary of State without consultation or explanation, with different performance standards for different functions and different authorities, applying at different times is absolute and legal. That is why we and the Liberal Democrats joined on Second Reading to describe the Bill as the final nationalisation of local government. The hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt) laughs, but I should like to know when he is going to contribute to our discussion. Apart from the hon. Member for Northampton, North, who made a distinguished contribution, Labour Back Benchers have been silent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are transferring major powers to the Secretary of State, and the Minister periodically makes it very clear that the Government intend to use those powers to reach those local authorities that the previous Government could not reach through the CCT procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With typical generosity, my hon. Friend is being rather liberal with the Government. He made a comparison with CCT but he omitted to mention the fact that that procedure essentially affected the process rather than the outcome, whereas the Bill deals with—and sets—the outcome. In that sense, the Bill's provisions are far more draconian and centralising than any measure introduced by the previous Government. The Bill truly involves the nationalisation of local government and, incidentally, the nationalisation of police authorities and police forces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very interesting comment. I do not think that even the Secretary of State for Health, for example, sets national standards that are legally binding on hospital trusts. Obviously, there are legal obligations on medical staff—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Sally Keeble (Northamption, North)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should examine the health of the nation performance targets, which were set by his party when it was in government, and compare them with the Bill's aim, which is to protect standards for the public. Exactly the same issues are involved. When the hon. Gentleman's party was in government it did what the Bill proposes to do, and I should add that I supported the previous Government in their efforts to set health standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be wrong—I stand to be corrected if I am—but my understanding is that the health of the nation targets were targets that the previous Government set themselves. I do not think that they involved particular outcomes to particular activities in particular hospitals, let alone different targets for different hospitals at different times, which is the Government's proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
However, the comparison is interesting. Local authorities are meant to be independent of local government. There is no pretence that the national health service is anything other than a single national health service, but local authorities are meant to have an independent life of their own—councillors are meant to have brains and to be allowed to use them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill suggests that the Government did not mean what they said on the election hustings about decentralising. It will be left to the Conservative party—working, perhaps, with other parties, and possibly with some Labour Back Bench Committee members—to bring about the rejuvenation of local government. Local government ultimately needs the decentralisation of power from the centre, rather than the accrual of more and more power at the centre, which the Bill—and, in particular, the clause—will bring about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been excited to contribute to this part of our proceedings—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I notice the glee with which my comment is greeted by Labour Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex was absolutely right to point to the prescriptive nature of the clause's provisions. Perhaps the time has come for us to set out our stall and to clarify where we stand. I believe that there has been a misapprehension. More uniform government, which is based around uniform targets, is an ambition that is questioned by the vast majority of hon. Members on both sides of the House. Surely we want diverse local government, which has the ability to innovate and to excite its electors so that different local authorities—and different parties within local authorities—can differentiate and offer real choices to local people. We do not want uniform targets that are set by a Secretary of State. I realise that the Minister spent a couple of years on Durham city council—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I stand corrected, but that is what it says in the Minister's biography.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I served on the county council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg the Committee's pardon, Mr. O'Brien.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State might have no personal experience of local government. These targets, this draconian measure, this uniformity and nationalisation are a slap in the face for those of us who believe in local democracy and the right of local authorities to deliver with flair and innovation a particular service appropriate to their locality. Labour Members should realise what their Government are doing. I do not agree with the Government—I would not have agreed had the Government been Conservative. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> I would not have agreed with them because I believe that local democracy is an important part of our democratic infrastructure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex was right. He spoke with typical generosity and moderation, but I wanted to put the issue into sharper focus because it is important that the real friends of local government stand up and expose the Bill for what it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help the Committee if I explain and set out the policy behind the clause which, having listened to the two previous contributions, I shall try to do with a straight face. I am sure that with your long experience in this House, Mr. O'Brien, you will appreciate how difficult it is to do that sometimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To deliver best value, authorities will need to establish priorities. To do that, they will need to know what others think of their performance and how it compares with that of other authorities. They will also need to identify where improvements are needed. To help authorities achieve that, the Government will, as part of best value, introduce a new performance framework. Pages 67 to 69 of the White Paper, which I circulated to members of the Committee yesterday, set out our thinking. Hon. Members might also wish to refer to figure 7 on page 65 which illustrates the best value performance management framework.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just a small point. Will the Minister recognise that many of us have not received or seen those papers? Perhaps she might expand on what is in them rather than assuming that we know what they contain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to test the tolerance of either the Chair or the Committee. I appreciate that hon. Members may not have received the papers, but I know that members of the Committee are thoroughly prepared for our proceedings and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has seen the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Performance indicators are a measure of an authority's performance. Where appropriate, performance standards will set out the minimum acceptable level of service provision. Performance targets will set out what level of performance the authority needs to achieve within a specified time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been considering three tiers of performance indicators. First, a small set of general health indicators to show how authorities measure up as democratic institutions and service providers. Those should provide a snapshot of where authorities stand on a small set of key dimensions. Secondly, a relatively small number of national indicators, specified by the Government but developed in consultation with local government, the Audit Commission and others. I expect those indicators to be significantly fewer than the 238 currently prescribed by the Audit Commission. They will focus as far as possible on outcomes rather than inputs and will be designed to reflect the national interest in local performance. Again, I do not apologise for making the national interest explicit. We are attempting to rationalise what already exists as well as plug the gaps where necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before imposing a new requirement on authorities, the Government will consult widely with local government, the Audit Commission and other interested parties. Reference was made to organisations such as CIPFA, which would of course, be an interested party in some of these indicators. We will hold a series of seminars with interested bodies during the spring to discuss performance
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
indicators. We will then issue a formal consultation document in the summer. Like the Audit Commission, which, last summer, consulted a wide range of bodies about the publication of its information direction for 1998, which specified performance indicators for the financial year 1999–2000, we expect to consult a wide range of bodies. Indicators cannot and will not be developed in isolation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the majority of other indicators will be developed locally. I expect locally set indicators greatly to outweigh national indicators in terms of numbers. Authorities will be encouraged to develop their own indicators to suit local circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Audit Commission will retain its powers to specify indicators under the Audit Commission Act 1998.1 would expect it to set indicators that will provide contextual data that will supplement the national set of indicators. The Government will seek to agree a memorandum of understanding with the Audit Commission to make the respective roles clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some service areas, the Government will set standards, which authorities will be required to meet. Some of them may have statutory basis already. An example is food standards, where standards are set nationally, and authorities are aware that they must meet them. An authority that fails to meet a standard will be judged to have failed the test to best value for that service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can, by way of example, produce Northamptonshire county council's performance plan. In terms of local targets and performance setting, and the democratically achieved objectives that I am sure we all want local authorities to set, it puts into practice exactly the sort of principles that the Minister has described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend represents a constituency that is within a best value pilot area. We, too, are learning by the experience of best value pilots. Today, or perhaps it will now be tomorrow, hon. Members will be sent an interim report of those pilots, which will illustrate some of the lessons that are being learnt. That report reached the Department only during the past few days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the performance standard that the Secretary of State may lay down in respect of food. What other standards might be laid down? Does the Minister agree that, as framed in the clause, they are absolutely binding? Could she also explain whether there will be standards on empty council homes, the cleanliness of streets or the effectiveness of waste disposal? Are they the sort of things for which there will be national standards, by which local authorities will be bound?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made it clear that we will consult widely on the matter, and reflect on the findings. I shall give an example of an indicator that we are considering. We propose to set a date by which authorities should ensure that, for five, six and seven-year-olds, class sizes do not exceed thirty. However, standards will be set for only a small proportion of services, and the Government do not intend to impose a large number of new standards.

	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
Clause 4 will allow the Secretary of State to specify performance indicators and standards for best value, and to do so by order. It will allow him to specify different indicators and standards for different authorities, and for them to be applied at different times; to aim to promote improvements in the way authorities carry out their functions, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness and to have regard to the views of the Audit Commission in developing those indicators and standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill makes it clear that best value will embrace the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. The performance measurement framework of best value will underpin those principles by reporting on five dimensions: strategic objectives, cost and efficiency, service delivery outcomes, quality and fair access to services. Clause 4 does not deal with targets, which will be set when authorities carry out best value reviews. Targets and all functions will be set out in best value performance plans, including those for functions where best value reviews have not yet been carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 5, the Secretary of State will issue guidance to authorities, setting out how they should conduct those best value reviews, including issues about how targets should be set. Auditors will check that the targets set are reasonable and consistent, which might help the hon. Member for North Essex. In practice, the targets will be set by best value authorities. Several factors will need to be taken into account, including resources, the views of local people and any minimum requirements for improvement set out by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As mentioned earlier, page 69 of the White Paper states, that, as a minimum, the Government will require authorities to set indicators specified nationally by the Secretary of State; and set targets over five years for cost-efficiency and quality, which are consistent with what the top 25 per cent, of authorities are achieving. We shall set out additional requirements where sensible and feasible to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sought to explain why clause 4 is an essential part of the best value framework. I should now like to move on to the amendments because I was becoming fearful—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Lady moves on, will she give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really should move on to the amendments. I am likely to cover some of the issues on which the hon. Gentleman wants to intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of amendments would remove a number of provisions within the Bill which would allow the Secretary of State to make orders in respect of performance indicators and standards, best value reviews and best value performance plans. Instead, the amendments provide only that the Secretary of State should issue guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that the performance of all best value authorities can be measured and compared on the basis of a national suite of best value performance indicators that properly reflect the national interest. Of course, not all indicators and standards will apply to all authorities at the
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
same time. But where they do, there should be no discretion for authorities to opt in or out of the arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members look perplexed, but it would not be sensible or possible to impose a national standard for class sizes on shire districts, because shire districts have no responsibility for schooling. Hence we must ensure the ability to specify different aspects to different groups of classes of authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed that the Minister has used class sizes as an example. In my own county of Essex the education settlement is considerably less generous than in many other authorities. However, being a Conservative-controlled authority at the moment, we end up with the Prime Minister denigrating our county in the House, regardless of the financial disadvantages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be within the power of the Secretary of State to set a standard for Essex county council to meet its obligations yet to take a more benign view of some of the worst local authorities in inner London—without any requirement to provide reason or explanation. It is astonishing because the Government were elected on the opposite platform of giving power back to local authorities. The Minister needs to examine the problems that occur as classes reach the limit of 30 pupils. Such limits may prevent younger brothers or sisters entering a particular school, so that they have to go to another school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have learnt that it is not sensible to give way to the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that issues addressed in clause 4 have the force of law. Of course, the Government would consult widely with local government, the Audit Commission and

	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
others before imposing a new requirement on best value authorities. National performance indicators and standards will reflect national priorities. If that is not so, how can people judge whether those priorities are being properly assessed at a local level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely it is for electors to determine through the ballot box whether a local authority achieves the correct level of performance?

In cases where there is a national interest, we have an over-arching need for consistency of approach. We have therefore opted to provide an approach based on orders, precisely to deal with the mischievous points that the hon. Member for north Essex made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek to promote a diversity and flexibility of approach which reflects local circumstances, and we shall do so via the guidance route. We shall issue guidance on the form, content, procedures and timing of a best value review. There is an over-arching need to ensure that, when
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
performance indicators and standards are applied, they are applied consistently. Orders are, of course, subject to parliamentary scrutiny in a way that guidance is not. For these reasons, clause 4(1) should enable the Secretary of State to specify indicators and standards via an order, and clause 4(2), which provides flexibility in the use of the orders, should similarly be retained. I cannot accept the amendments, which would serve to undermine one of the cornerstones of local government modernisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 92 would remove the powers of the Secretary of State to issue guidance on the form, content and manner of publication of best value performance plans. I have said that, where we seek to promote diversity and flexibility of approach that reflects local circumstances, we are approaching this via guidance. That applies in this case. Appropriate guidance such as good practice arising from the work being done by the best value pilots will, I am sure, be invaluable in building on the effectiveness of performance plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 117 would, additionally, have the effect that, in issuing guidance, the Secretary of State should aim to improve the way in which best value authorities exercise functions, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. The Secretary of State would also be able to issue different guidance to different authorities. Both these matters are already provided for in subsections (2) and (3) of clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of the amendments to clauses 5 and 6 is similar. Best value reviews are a key element of the whole best value process, providing for review of all functions and the setting of targets for improving performance. The way in which the reviews are conducted will therefore be central to the improvements that are made. Our intention is that best value authorities should fundamentally review all functions over a period, probably five years. It is essential that all best value authorities complete a full cycle of reviews for all their functions, in a timely fashion, so that targets for improving performance can be set and improvements brought about early.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that authorities should have some discretion in undertaking their own review programme, but there will, none the less, be a need to ensure a consistent approach on the core requirements—for example, the four Cs: challenge, compare, consult, compete. It is essential that all authorities address certain key elements in carrying out reviews and that they genuinely challenge the status quo. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Opposition Members do not wish us to concentrate on early-years education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Minister made appoint about comparability. Why is it necessary to compare local authorities, which serve different communities in different parts of the country? Local needs differ greatly, and local authorities are sensitive to the needs of their electorates. Why do the Government worship the false idol of comparability? I accept that the Government are not the first to do that— the trend was probably established after the war—but why does the measure exacerbate that trend?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Labour Members find that extraordinary because the previous Government introduced such practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that local people want to know whether services are more effective in other areas and, if so, how their authority will change matters. This morning, the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) said that local people often did not have the experience and knowledge of how things could be done differently. I want to ensure that people have information on which to assess whether they are receiving the best from local services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I have dealt with the point, and I want to move on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of local performance plans to the best value process and the need for consistency make it necessary for some specifications to be established through statutory instrument. Consistency is necessary because of the close relationship between local performance plans and the performance indicator framework, which has national and local elements. Local performance plans are also related to best value reviews, which have national features.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Key elements of local performance plans need to be specified to allow local people to compare the performance of their best value authority with that of others. We must ensure that local people have enough information on which to judge. The best value performance plan will be the principal way in which authorities are held accountable to local people. We can achieve consistency in accountability only if the requirements are established by statutory instrument. An order would list specific elements that authorities would need to include in their plans. Guidance would offer flexibility but would not have the same force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4(2) allows different indicators and standards for different functions, in different authorities at different times. Amendment No. 120 would remove that flexibility, so that all indicators and standards would apply to all best value authorities simultaneously, or to none. Neither option is sensible. Different authorities carry out different functions at different times. Indicators and standards will often relate to specific functions, and, therefore, they can apply only to authorities that carry them out in the period that the indicators and standards cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
Amendment No. 120 would also remove the flexibility to specify standards for the future, and would restrict our ability to effect our commitments in the local government White Papers to improve local authorities' efficiency and quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 124 would require the Secretary of State to take account of the various agreed EC public procurement directives when issuing guidance. I appreciate that hon. Members want reassurance that those directives will continue to apply when best value is in place. The directive set out a procurement method which contracting authorities must use when letting certain categories of contract with a value above a specified threshold. The Government wish to see local authorities following good procurement practice, which is why clause 17 allows for the amendment of section 17 of the Local Government Act 1988, which prevents them from having regard to certain specified non-commercial matters. We will have a full discussion of those provisions in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us make it clear that we intend to use the powers in the Bill to promote good procurement practice in the interest of best value, not to weaken the safeguards against abuses of contract compliance. Any change will have to be consistent with EC procurement rules and the Government's procurement policy. Best value will not affect the application of EC public procurement and acquired directives in UK law. Of course, the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales will have regard to all current legislation when he acts under clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 90 would require best value authorities to reflect sustainable development, and, in particular, an authority's local agenda 21 strategy in this best value performance plan. We have made clear out commitment to principles of sustainable development. Our White Paper on local government confirmed our manifesto commitment to place a new duty on local authorities to promote the social, economic and environmental well being of their areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
