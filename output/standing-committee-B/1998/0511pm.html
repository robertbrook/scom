<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committeee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 12, in page 3, line 26, leave out '1,100' and insert '1,600'.</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Whittingdale <span class='memberconstituency'>(Maldon and East Chelmsford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we broke for lunch, I was introducing amendments Nos. 7 and 8. As was said, clause 8 will increase VED for cars from £150 to £155 and introduce a new rate of £100 for vehicles with an engine capacity of 1100 cc or less. When the provision was introduced by the Chancellor, it was greeted as a bold step that would encourage environmentally friendly vehicles, but on closer examination it does not live up to its billing.<br><br>
I tabled several parliamentary questions on the new £100 rate. When I asked how many cars in the UK have an engine capacity below 1100 cc, I was told that, according to the records of the Driver and Vehicles Licensing Agency for September 1998, about 8 per cent, of registered vehicles have an engine capacity that does not exceed 1100 cc. On further examination, we discovered not only that the number of such vehicles is relatively small, but that they are fairly obscure vehicles. We obtained a list of all cars currently made in, or imported into the UK that have an engine capacity of less than 1100 cc. There are 19 of them and, for the Committee's benefit, I shall read them out. They are the Subaru Vivio, the 847 cc Daihatsu Cuore, the 989 cc Daihatsu Cuore, the Daihatsu Move, the Daihatsu Sirion, the Suzuki Wagon R+ and the Toyota Yaris, which are made in Japan; the Daewoo Matiz and the Hyundai Atoz, which are made in South Korea; the Perodua Nippa, which is made in Malaysia; the Fiat Seicento, which is made in Poland; the Citroen Saxo, which is made in France; the Vauxhall Corsa, which is made in Portugal; the Suzuki Alto, which is made in India; the Suzuki Swift, which is made in Hungary; the Nissan Micra, which is made in the UK [<i>Hon. Members:</i> "Hooray!"]; the Seat Arosa and the Volkswagen Lupo, which are made in Germany; and the Volkswagen Polo, which is made in Spain.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
As members of the Committee will have detected, of those 19 vehicles, only one—the Nissan Micra, which is produced in Sunderland—is UK-based.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geraint Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the Committee should pass a resolution that lower VED should be levied only on cars made in Britain?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to continue my argument, he will see that the amendment would benefit not only the environment, but British manufacturers. Precisely 38,000 Nissan Micras with the relevant engine capacity were built and registered in the UK in 1998. The amendment would extend the band to include cars with an engine capacity of up to 1400 cc. In doing so, a number of vehicles that fall just outside the present limit, and which are made in the United Kingdom would be included. For example, on hearing the Chancellor's Budget statement, drivers of the Rover 200, which is badged as having an 1100 cc engine, may have felt that they were likely to benefit from the new reduced rate. Unfortunately, that car has an 1120 cc engine, so it does not fall within the Chancellor's limit.<br><br>
The Peugeot 206, originating in this country, unfortunately has a capacity of 1124 cc, which is outside the Chancellor's limit. The Ford Fiesta is also just outside that limit. I suspect that many drivers, when listening to the Chancellor's speech, thought that they would enjoy reduced vehicle excise duty. It was only when they examined the small print that they discovered that they would receive no benefit at all.<br><br>
I should like to quote from one or two people who commented on this Budget measure. Mr. Stephen Collingbourne, who lives in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude), wrote a perceptive letter, in which he asked:
<br><blockquote><p>"What idiot came up with 1,100 cc? There must be many old, 'non-cat' cars with small engines polluting the atmosphere. Most modern, fuel-efficient 'super-minis' have bigger engines to cope with catalytic converters and larger and heavier bodies designed to meet new crash safety regulations. Drivers using their cars on the motorway, or in rural areas, need reasonable sized engines. Small, fuel-efficient cars usually have up to 1,400 cc petrol engines."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Ray Hutton, who writes in the motoring section of <i>The Sunday Times,</i> reviewed the cars that will fall into the new reduced rate band. I will not go through them all again, but he made some interesting observations about the performance of each vehicle, and it would be safe to say that he was not especially impressed with many of them. He concluded:<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"It is an undisputed fact that some engines with a cylinder capacity greater than 1.1 litres are more efficient—and therefore do more miles per gallon and contribute less to global warming—than the tiddlers Brown has favoured. The choice of 1.1 litres as a cut-off point is more about balancing the books than saving the planet."</p></blockquote>
Some industry bodies have also commented on the Chancellor's proposals. We are told that this is only a stopgap measure, before we reach the full, graduated VED scheme promised for next year. There may be some merit in moving towards that graduated scheme, which will take greater account of the emissions from different engine capacities, but the smallest-engined
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0080">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
vehicles are not necessarily the ones most likely to benefit the environment. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The motor industry had indicated that it supported a reform based on CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions, but made clear that the introduction of a temporary or interim scheme would lead to confusion among motorists and potential uncertainty in the new car market. The Treasury has already acknowledged that engine size is a poor guide to environmental performance."</p></blockquote>
The Automobile Association has also commented:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Chancellor's Budget decision to reduce VED for owners of cars 1,100 cc or less will have little or no environmental benefit. The result will be that quite significant and unfair anomalies will be introduced to VED that people will not understand or relate to."</p></blockquote>
The AA goes on to point out that engine size is not an especially good indicator as to environmental efficiency, and that
<br><blockquote><p>"the break at 1,100 cc … specifically favours older, more polluting cars at the expense of more modern, greener vehicles that might have larger engines".</p></blockquote>
The AA also cites a number of cars just over the 1,100 cc threshold that one might have expected the Chancellor to include in this measure. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The AA believes that the Government's proposals for a lower band of VED are at best under-developed. The change will make no contribution to the Government's environmental objectives to deal with global warming or urban air quality."</p></blockquote>
It calls on the Government to
<br><blockquote><p>"undertake a full and open review of all road user taxation."</p></blockquote>
We echo that because one cannot consider VED separately from other taxes on the motorist, in particular the fuel duties that we have already debated in relation to clause 2.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Love <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edmonton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: You were not here this morning, Mr. Butterfill, but we spent the whole morning being chided for our lack of environmentalism and other failures, yet, throughout the morning, there was only one mention of the cost of the Opposition amendment. As the hon. Gentleman talked briefly about taxes, I should like to ask him what the cost of his amendments would be and how the Opposition would fund their commitment to continue the Government's expenditure on health and education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that the cost of amendment No. 7, which would extend the band from 1100 cc to 1400 cc, would be about £19.9 million, so we are talking about a relatively modest sum. Of course, it is only an interim measure and we look forward to seeing the Government's proposals for the new graduated scheme in due course. The purpose of the amendment is to turn what is essentially a gimmick by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which will have negligible benefits for British motorists, into a serious measure that will benefit a considerable number of drivers of small-engined vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Love</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figure that the hon. Gentleman has given the Committee of £19 million may be a significant underestimate. According to other figures
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
that have been suggested, the amount may be in excess of £400 million. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will enlighten the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to do so. A letter from the House of Commons Library says:
<br><blockquote><p>"On the basis of the number of motor vehicles licensed in the UK, the cost of extending the reduced band would be about £19.9 million."</p></blockquote>
I know that the Government are keen on figures from the House of Commons Library—that was demonstrated during the debate on fuel duties—so I hope that they will accept that figure.<br><br>
I do not want to prolong the debate unduly. The purpose of the amendment is to turn this into a measure that will benefit people who drive smaller, more efficient, cars. Obviously, we shall want to return to the measure and the whole question of VED in due course when the Government produce their proposals for the new graduated scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 12 would go one step further than the Conservative amendment by stating that the tax benefit of reduced VED applies to cars with an engine size of up to 1600 cc. As we have said during debates on the Floor of the House, we believe that people need to be compensated for the higher petrol duty taxes that they are being asked to pay. We have given the Government our support for those higher petrol duties on the basis that they should be accompanied by reductions in VED. The two are closely linked in our minds, Mr. Whittingdale. [<i>Interruption.</i>]<br><br>
Having followed the honourable Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) in the debate, his name is uppermost in my mind. I apologise.<br><br>
We should be clear that the clause does not give people an incentive to own more fuel-efficient cars. We are promised that those incentives will be included in next years's Finance Bill. The issue on which Liberal Democrats have focused is compensation, which we believe should be more generous than the Government are proposing. Costs would be greater, and I am sure that we shall hear from Ministers about the exorbitant cost of our proposal and that of the Conservative party, but such comments should be set against the high revenues that are being raised from higher fuel duties. If the Government were concerned about the cost, they could introduce a truly graduated system of VED and charge even higher rates than the proposed £155 on cars of higher engine capacity, and thus introduce revenue neutrality in VED.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford said, the Government's proposal will help only a small number of car owners. The Government's figures in the press release accompanying the Chancellor's announcement suggested that 1.8 million car owners would benefit. According to the figures supplied to me by the Library—I understand that they came from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions—the Conservative proposal would help another 6.5 million car owners
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0081">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 123</span>
and our proposal for a cut-off at 1600 cc would help an additional 4.3 car owners, leaving just over 9 million car owners paying the full rate of VED.<br><br>
Is that the right approach, and do all those car owners need that amount of compensation? We believe that they do and that this is a sensible way of targeting compensation for the ever-increasing petrol duties that car owners must pay. Our amendment would also make the tax system more logical. It is unnecessary to tax ownership as VED has for so long, and the Government are right to increase the tax on vehicle usage. That is how to obtain the proper incentives in the tax system for environmental benefits.<br><br>
If political support for environmental taxes is to be maintained, it is important to have a benefit and a penalty—the stick and carrot approach. If the Government adopted that approach, they would not only win the argument with the public more effectively, but the public would begin to see the relevance of environmental taxes, and support for those taxes would increase. There will be other such proposals in future Finance Bills and there would be wider support in Parliament for raising environmental taxes. If the Government get it wrong now and reduce political consensus and support, that will affect not only the measures before us today, but other beneficial measures to be introduced by this and future Governments.<br><br>
My final point concerns a matter that was raised with me by my hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Mr. Jones). One of his constituents wrote to him about the applicability of the cut in VED for people who need large vehicles because they are disabled and need to transport wheelchairs and so on. They will receive no benefit from the cut and my hon. Friend's constituent is worried that disabled people are being discriminated against.<br><br>
We did not table amendments on that because there are probably other way in the tax system to ensure that people who need larger cars can be compensated for the cost of higher duty. The mobility allowance is especially relevant in this context.<br><br>
The Government do not appear to be minded to use such mechanisms to compensate disabled people, who will not receive anything under the Government's proposals. However, they could use VED to help disabled people. For example, they could acknowledge the extra costs faced by the family of a disabled person who needs additional equipment and regular transport by giving such families a special dispensation for one vehicle.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will consider the merits of the Liberal Democrat and Conservative proposals, which would strengthen the welcome shift towards environmental taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaun Woodward <span class='memberconstituency'>(Witney)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate on the amendment has made clear the clause's inherent weaknesses. It tinkers with the tax system, which desperately and obviously needs urgent reform. The clause is therefore regressive; it is also environmentally unfriendly. The AA recently said that the Government's proposals for a lower VED band were
<br><blockquote><p>"at best underdeveloped and lack economic and environmental
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
sense. The change will make no contribution to"—</p></blockquote>
the Government's—
<br><blockquote><p>"environmental objectives to deal with global warming or urban air quality and may undermine people's environmental goodwill."</p></blockquote>
The Government's proposal is neither environmentally friendly—that claim simply cannot be made for the clause—nor part of a coherent strategy to deal with global warming and other environmental matters. The issue is particularly pressing because the Government signalled the fact that they would introduce a different system in the autumn of next year, based not on engine size but on emissions.<br><br>
Road users currently pay about £30 billion in taxes, but they get back less than one quarter of that sum in investment in the roads that they use. The situation in my constituency, where roads are unrepaired, makes it clear that the Government's roads policy is a shambles, and the situation throughout the country makes it clear that their integrated transport policy has failed.<br><br>
The VED is designed to help finance the road system, which is chronically underfunded. Roads are often not repaired, but if they are repaired, work is poorly co-ordinated and lead to the chaos that we witnessed in Oxfordshire on the A34.<br><br>
The Government are going for a cheap headline by proposing to cut road tax for vehicles with a lower engine capacity. As has already been said, that proposal will have an extremely limited effect—less than 2 million of the 22 million cars on the roads will benefit. As always, the Government claim that the proposal will help the poorest, but the poorest do not buy new cars. They often drive old second-hand cars with high emissions, which do the most damage to the atmosphere.<br><br>
This is a bad Budget for poorer people who drive cars. The Government have increased fuel tax, which is bad news for those on the lowest incomes. The new fuel duties will add about £60 to the annual fuel bill of those who drive about 8,500 miles a year. What the Government have given with one hand for new cars they have taken back with the other.<br><br>
The Paymaster General knows about the relevant dangers. In April 1998, the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs published a report entitled "Green Taxation and the Budget". In that report, she is quoted as having said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The point I was making was that we have this whole area of what could be argued as a regressive tax".</p></blockquote>
In their White Paper on UK climate change, issued a year ago, the Government stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The impact of this measure is likely to be relatively small."</p></blockquote>
The Government will change their whole policy on the matter next year, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions believes that the measure will, by and large, have no effect, and the Financial Secretary acknowledges that it is regressive. None the less, the Government are introducing the measure in the clause. The incoherence of that approach is demonstrated by the fact that only a dozen of the 44 cleanest new cars in terms of CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions—according to the Government's figures—are below 1100 cc.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0082">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 125</span>
The proposal is opposed by anybody who has looked at the facts. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said:
<br><blockquote><p>"the introduction of a temporary or interim scheme would lead to confusion among motorists and potential uncertainty in the new car market."</p></blockquote>
The Government claim to understand competition and to be on the side of manufacturing, but the clause is ample demonstration that they are not on the side of the manufacturers, the motorist or competition.<br><br>
As the AA has said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's proposal for new cars to be taxed on the basis of CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions does not have environmental literacy and is a system that people will not be able to understand. Reducing VED for owners of cars of 1100 cc or less will have little or no environmental benefit. Quite significant and unfair anomalies will be introducted to VED that people will not understand."</p></blockquote>
That is a critical point, as it raises the question of why on earth the Government are introducing the clause, and why they have alighted on the figure of 1100 cc. Only 8 per cent, of currently licensed vehicles will qualify for the reduction, and only 70 per cent, of those were first registered before catalytic converters became compulsory in 1992. Vehicles with catalytic converters produce emissions more than 90 per cent, lower than pre-catalytic converter vehicles such as older Minis, Metros and Fiestas. Therefore, introducing the break at 1100 cc specifically favours older, more polluting cars at the expense of modern greener vehicles that might have larger engines. The clause has no environmental credibility whatever. It is a cheap attempt by the Government to steal the clothes of the green lobby while preparing a massive tax hike for those with vehicles whose engine capacity is more than 1100 cc.<br><br>
The clause also creates confusion about vehicles badging, as some vehicles are badged at 1.1 litre even though their engine capacity is in excess of 1100 cc. Will the Financial Secretary clarify the treatment of a vehicle such as the Citroen Saxo, which is badged at 1.1 litre but whose engine capacity is 1124 cc? The same applies to the Peugeot 106 and Peugeot 206. The Rover 2000 is badged at 1.1. litre but has an engine capacity of 1120 cc. The Fiat Seicento is badged at 1.1 litre but has an engine capacity of 1108 cc.<br><br>
Will the Financial Secretary tell us whether the reduction will apply to those cars?<br><br>
Extending the band upwards would help many people who own such cars out of difficulties. Those who own cars badged at 1.1 litre, but which have a slightly higher engine capacity would no longer be confused.<br><br>
As the AA has said:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Chancellor is just tinkering away with an archaic tax which is in dire need of reform."</p></blockquote>
The likely impact of the measure is absolutely miserly compared with the carrot that is offered in other European countries.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>

It is worth noting that the differential in the road tax paid by owners of the smallest and largest cars in the Republic of Ireland is £585. If the measure is to be used as a carrot to encourage people to behave in a different way, the Government should pay attention to the good practices of other countries. However, they ignore that evidence and crucially—the clause demonstrates this in spades—they do not understand the environmental arguments. If they did, they would not tinker with the system now, but introduce a fair system next year.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary could clarify the matter by making it clear that people who drive larger cars that are more environmentally friendly than some with a smaller engine capacity will have their environmental credentials recognised.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will promise not to impose whacking great tax increases on those drivers in the next few years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>. I support both the amendment and what my hon. Friend said. There is a lack of logic in the Government's demarcation of 1100 cc. The Treasury's press release No. 7 of 9 March says that the proposal was part of
<br><blockquote><p>"A package of measures reforming Vehicle Excise Duty ... so that it gives better environmental signals".</p></blockquote>
If that is the case, it will be interesting to hear how the Economic Secretary defends the Government's illogical position of encouraging the sales of cars with carbon dioxide emissions in excess of agreed European targets. The amendment is more consistent with reality than the Government's policy.<br><br>
The European motor industry has entered a unique and ground-breaking agreement within the European Union to reduce CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions for new passenger cars by 25 per cent, by 2008. That means a carbon dioxide emission of 140g per kilometre. An interim target of between 165g and 170g of CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> per kilometre is to be achieved by 2003. If we bear those parameters in mind, it is logical to encourage motor cars that meet those standards on to the road at the earliest opportunity.<br><br>
The logic of the Government's proposal to reduce VED for cars with engines of 1100 cc. or below breaks down because some of those cars have a CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emission level per kilometre of up to 172g. Why do the Government favour reducing VED for those cars when an emission of 172g per kilometre exceeds even the intermediate target that the European motor vehicle industry has agreed to reach by 2003?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Love</span><span class='membercontribution'>: According to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), the measure will cover 6.5 million cars. On the basis that it will cost the Exchequer just over £19 million, a quick calculation puts that at about £3 a car. What is the amendment about?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, that is not my point. I am talking about the consistency of environmental targets. Some cars are favoured by the 1100 cc threshold, although they exceed the agreed interim target on CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions. One might ask why the cleanest cars should be included in the 1100 cc to 1400

cc band. Cars with engine capacities of up to 1400 cc, such as the Suzuki Swift and the Volkswagen Polo, which produce 139g of CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> per kilometre, the Nissan Micra, which produces 151g, and the Ford Ka, which produces 155g, will not benefit from the proposed reduction in VED for cars with engine capacities up to 1100 cc, even though some cars in the latter category have a worse CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> performance.<br><br>
The Government should have adopted a logical approach based on CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions rather than simply drawing a crude dividing line. Analysis shows that the reduction in VED of £50 for the 2.3 million cars with an engine capacity of less than 1100 cc is magically compensated for through putting £5 on VED for all other cars. Equally, 1.9 litre diesel cars are also omitted from the provison. I realise that they are slightly beyond the amendment's scope, but we should note that such vehicles—for example, the Ford Focus, which produces 132g of CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> per kilometre—are not covered by the clause—or indeed, by the amendment. In his consultation document, the Chancellor tried to adopt a logical approach to the matter. The Economic Secretary should explain why the Government have failed to adopt a logical approach at this statge.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Evans. I apologise, I meant to say Mr. Davies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Geraint Evans is the singer, Mr. Butterfill. I shall not sing on this occasion.<br><br>
It is a bit strange for the Opposition to make much of the fact that engine size is not a perfect indicator of impact on the environment. The AA brief from which certain Committee members have widely quoted states that
<br><blockquote><p>"engine size in itself is not a good indicator as to how environmentally efficient a vehicles is".</p></blockquote>
Having established that engine size is an imperfect indicator, which the Government accept, the Opposition tabled an amendment that would raise the engine size threshold from 1100 cc to 1400 cc, at a cost of £400 million. That is absurd.<br><br>
The Liberal Democrats' proposal to increase the threshold from 1100 cc to 1600 cc, which would cost £35 billion, is also completely off the wall. I am sure that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton would accept that engine size is not a good indictor.<br><br>
The Government have put in place a low band that will generate net beneficial effects and send a powerful signal to the markets and the consumer about the green direction in which we are moving. What is more, in the autumn of 2000 we shall move to a graduated, sophisticated CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub -->-based system that has been applauded across the industry. Indeed, that system is applauded in the AA brief, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the government's proposals for new cars to be taxed on the basis of CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions does have environmental literacy".</p></blockquote>
How kind for the AA to say that.<br><br>
We are moving towards a position that will be universally applauded by the green community and the industrial community. It would be silly for the Committee further to contemplate excess expenditure
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
on changes that will prove obsolete within a year. We should also remember that by the autumn of 2000, some people may be questioning the credibility of moving towards a sophisticated scheme at such speed. EU legislation requires that information on CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions from cars be provided by then. I understand that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency will have in place a flexible computer system to measure and monitor such information, and collect the relevant amounts of money.<br><br>
I commend this part of the Budget to the Committee, and without further ado, I shall sit down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee seems to be afflicted by confusion over people's names. Perhaps I could take this opportunity to clarify some job titles. Unfortunately, the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack)—no, the right hon. Gentleman got it right. For the benefit of the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), who made the mistake this morning, and the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward), who made the mistake this afternoon, I should explain that I am the Economic Secretary, and I am responsible within the Treasury for environmental taxes. I am sure that their colleagues will relay that information to them.<br><br>
Turning to the amendment proposed by the official Opposition—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am feeling generous. Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady. I could not understand why the Financial Secretary kept mouthing an "F" at me this morning. I did not know what it meant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am relieved that we have cleared that matter up.<br><br>
I shall begin by telling the Committee that I have today placed in the Library—I am sure that hon. Members will be grateful for it—a copy of a report summarising the responses to our pre-Budget consultation exercise on the reform of VED. The report has been available on request, but I regret to say that no one has requested it. I thought that it might be helpful to the Committee, and courteous to hon. Members, if I were to make it available in the Library.<br><br>
Hon. Members who read the report will see that in response to proposals that we made last year to introduce the reduced rate of VED for smaller cars, many respondents said that we should use engine size as the basis for the reduced rate for existing vehicles. Most of those respondents suggested that we should set the first threshold at 1000 cc. however, we decided to go further, and set the level at 1100 cc. As my hon. Friend and others have said, that will mean that the drivers of more than 1.8 million smaller cars will benefit from a £55 cut in their road tax. Not surprisingly, that measure has been warmly welcomed by many motorists and business users who will benefit from the scheme.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 129</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Economic Secretary is in the mood to place information in the Library, will she also assure the Committee that she will place in the Library the study that she has no doubt undertaken to show how a reduction of £55 will influence motorists' purchasing decisions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that intervention, and I shall make that information available later this afternoon. I hope, although I am not entirely confident, that he will then be satisfied. However, we shall try.<br><br>
The introduction of the reduced rate—the tax cut—for the drivers of cars with engine capacities up to 1100 cc. will cost about £85 million. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford would, as I think that he now accepts, cost not £19 million but about £410 million a year extra.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Library staff have confirmed that they had misread a table. They have now told us that they believe that our amendment would cost £250 million—but some confusion still exists. We concede that it would cost a little more than we had previously thought.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We all know how easy it is to make mistakes when reading complicated tables. I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has followed my example of promptly correcting an error when it is discovered. Perhaps it will help if I explain the arithmetic to him.<br><br>
The amendment would bring within the scope of the reduced rate approximately 7.4 million more vehicles. If 7.4 million is multiplied by the £55 reduction that the amendment would secure, that gives a figure of £410 million. That is where that figure comes from.<br><br>
The real importance of the figure is that, as with so many of the Opposition's spending promises, they have suggested an increase in spending, but will not tell us how they plan to pay for it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before she develops her argument, the Economic Secretary might follow the same principle as the Government in funding the £55 reduction and the £5 addition, by telling us what it would mean if the £250 million was spread out over the remaining vehicle population of cars above 1400 cc.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms.Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will indeed come to that very point. If we increase the threshold on a revenue-neutral basis, and thus spread the additional cost across the main rate of VED, the main rate of VED would have to rise to £185, so the drivers of some 15 million vehicles that do not qualify for the reduced rate would face a rise of up to £30 in their VED bill. However, the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford quoted one correspondent who accused the Chancellor of seeking to balance his books. We can be quite certain that the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford and his hon. Friends have no desire to balance the books. I calculate that the running total of the Opposition's policies, in relation to last year's and this year's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 130</span>
Budget, is, for the current year, more than £10 billion. This afternoon, they have added another £410 million to that £10 billion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary assure me that, as a result of further consideration of the Chancellor's proposals, no motorist will pay any more than an extra £30 under any new banding arrangements on VED that she may introduce?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter for next year's Budget and next year's Finance Bill, but I can certainly repeat the assurance given by my right hon. Friend that the new graduated system of VED will be introduced on a revenue-neutral basis. In the meantime, we must deal with the amendment, which would cost £410 million, making it quite clear that, accountants or not, the Opposition are as financially irresponsible in opposition as they were in government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady cites £10 billion in tax cuts proposed by the Opposition during this year's and last year's Finance Bill, but that £10 billion reminds me of the black hole to which the Conservative party alerted the country during the general election campaign when the Labour party said that it had no plans to raise taxes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is an accountant and I am sure that he will recall the scale of the public sector deficity that we inherited from the previous Government. We have reduced—indeed, we have eliminated—that public sector deficit and, under the stewardship of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, public finances are at last safe.<br><br>
Before I return to the impact of, and the intention behind, the new threshold, I should like to deal with the amendments moved by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. Although only one amendment has been called, two were grouped together. The purpose of the amendments is not entirely clear. In speaking to the first amendment, the hon. Gentleman seemed to say that it would extend the reduced rate to cars up to 1600 cc. The effect of the two amendments together would be to abolish VED for all vehicles up to 1600 cc. A more modest interpretation is that the reduced rate of £100 would apply to all vehicles up to 1600 cc, rather than 1400 cc as in the Conservative amendment, which would bring a further 4.5 million vehicles within the scope of the reduce rate on top of the 7.4 million vehicles covered by the Conservative amendment. The total cost, over and above that which the Government are already incurring, would be some £645 million a year.<br><br>
All that can be said about the bidding war between the two Opposition parties is that the Liberal Democrats are even less financially responsible than the modern Conservative party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So that we can ensure that we have all the figures, will the Minister confirm how much revenue the Government are raising from the fuel duty escalator?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0085">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 131</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall check that—I do not have the figure at my fingertips. I am concentrating on the figures for the different VED thresholds to ensure that I get those right and do not stray, as the Library did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodward</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is £1.6 billion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you.<br><br>
If the real intention of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton is to abolish VED on all vehicles up to 1600 cc, the cost would be more than £2 billion. If that were imposed on the remaining cars, VED would have to rise to £365.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton referred to people with disabilities. I assure him that disabled people are already given significant assistance with VED and up to 2 million of those on the higher rate of disability living allowance benefit from complete exemption from VED. That exemption has been in place since 1974.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Witney began by referring to the roads programme. I remind him that the previous Government slashed spending on roads and that the result of last year's comprehensive spending review was an increase in spending on roads by about a quarter over three years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Christoper Leslie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Shipley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the hon. Member for Witney is moaning about. In my constituency, the Bingley relief road is going ahead at a cost of £80 million—[Hon. Members: "What a surprise."]—and has been waiting for more than 30 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the debate will not degenerate into each hon. Member stating the effect on his constituency of the changes to the roads programme. That is not entirely relevant to what we are discussing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Butterfill. I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention and I am sure that his constituents will be delighted with that relief road. It is by no means the only one that is being financed from the increased roads programme.<br><br>
I shall elaborate on the thinking behind the 1100 cc threshold. It allows us to reward and encourage the use of smaller cars without unfairly penalising other car drivers. I said earlier that amendment No. 7 would result in an increase in VED for all cars of more than 1400 cc to £185. A Vauxhall Astra with a capacity of 1389 cc or a Ford Escort with 1391 cc would pay £100 reduced VED, but a driver with a Hyundai Accent at 1468 cc or a Honda Civic at 1493 cc would pay £185. I do not believe that that differential could be justified.<br><br>
I have given the cost of both amendments for the first year, but it would rise even higher in subsequent years as more people bought cars with engines below the threshold to avoid paying the higher rate. That would cause stark price distortions in the new and secondhand car market.<br><br>
The central point is that wherever we set the threshold, there will be boundary problems. People will miss out at the boundary. I am one. I drive a small car and carefully did not check its engine capacity—I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 132</span>
did not know it to start with—before deciding where the threshold should be set. When the threshold had been decided and announced, I checked the registration certificate and discovered that the engine capacity is 1108 cc. I understand people's disappointment—I was disappointed—when they discover that they miss out because they are just over the threshold, but that will happen wherever the threshold is set, whether it is at 1100 cc, 1400 cc, 1600 cc or somewhere in between.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How can the Economic Secretary justify a measure that will give a windfall in residual value to some of the most dirty and polluting cars in the country? Some 70 per cent, of cars under 1100 cc are not fitted with catalytic converters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a point that was made by the hon. Member for Witney. Some 70 per cent, of the vehicles qualifying under the Government's scheme predate 1992 and the introduction of catalytic converters, but even if the threshold were raised to 1600 cc, 60 per cent, of qualifying vehicles would predate 1992. The Opposition's difficulty is that they cannot bear to oppose a tax cut-that is what we are giving to drivers of 1.8 million vehicles—and at the same time overcome their environmental difficulties with the threshold by setting it even higher without substantially increasing the cost.<br><br>
I shall pursue the point about environmental goals. Clause 8 is part of a much larger reform of VED. Our environmental goal, which is shared by all right hon. and hon. Members in the Committee, is to encourage greater use of smaller, cleaner cars. The 1100 cc threshold will send a clear signal to people to consider the environmental impact of the cars that they drive and buy. The higher the threshold, the higher the cost to the Revenue and the compensating tax increase for other drivers and the weaker the environmental threshold. We have always acknowledged that engine size is not a perfect proxy for environmental effect. Some older, smaller cars will emit more local pollutants than newer cars with larger engines, but smaller cars are less likely to emit more of the damaging CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions about which we are particularly concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodward</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly worried that the Economic Secretary does not understand that damage is caused by car emissions, not by engine size. If she is to curry favour with the environmental lobby, she must understand that we need to deal with emissions from engines. If the whole argument were premised on engine size, one would have a totally false picture. In a few years' time, all engines, whether small or large, will become extremely damaging to the atmosphere. The Economic Secretary seems to have overlooked the fact that the crucial measurement is of CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should have waited a moment for me to elaborate on my argument. He is wrong to say that engine size is unrelated to emissions. The crucial factor in relation to greenhouse gases and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0086">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 133</span>
global warming is CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions, and in that regard engine size is a pretty good proxy for environmental damage. It is not perfect, but for existing cars it is the only proxy that we have. CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions data are not recorded for existing cars at the point of registration.<br><br>
It might help Committee members if I give some figures. Official fuel consumption tests show that new petrol cars with engines of up to 1100 cc have CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions of approximately 139 g per kilometre and that engines between 1100 cc and 1500 cc have average emissions of around 160 g per kilometre. The relevant figures are higher in relation to 1400 cc engines, which are referred to in the amendment. In relation to the 1100 cc threshold, the Vauxhall Corsa with an engine size of 973 cc has CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions of 138 g per kilometre, and the Volkswagen Polo with an engine size of 1043 cc has CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions of 139 g per kilometre.<br><br>
What would happen if the threshold were 1400 cc? The Vauxhall Astra with an engine size of 1389 cc has CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions of 205 g per kilometre, and the Ford Escort with an engine size of 1391 cc has CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions of 203 g per kilometre, which is some 60 g per kilometre more than the figure for engines that fall within the 1100 cc threshold.<br><br>
Engine size is not a perfect measure of environmental impact, and we do not pretend that it is—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Colin Breed <span class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Cornwall)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the Economic Secretary considered whether the crucial factor is the number of kilometres that are travelled? A car with higher emissions that travelled only 200 miles a year would have considerably lower emissions than a car that travelled 60,000 miles a year. Should not a vehicle's usage be taken into account?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who admirably makes the case for the fuel duty escalator. However, I thought that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton had argued against that escalator. Perhaps the Liberal Democrats need to discuss that matter among themselves.<br><br>
Engine size is a reasonable proxy for fuel efficiency and therefore for CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions, but it is not a perfect measure of environmental impact. If we had CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> data for all existing cars, we could of course have considered a CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub -->-based graduated VED system for existing cars, but we do not have that data. That is why the Chancellor announced that, at the earliest opportunity in the autumn of 2000, we shall introduce a graduated VED system for new cars that is based on CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions. The clause is a step in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodward</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Next year, will Government Ministers be given cars with engine sizes of less than 1100cc?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said this morning, I shall change later this year to a gas-fuel powered car, and I believe that my hon. Friend the Paymaster General will do the same. We shall make our contribution towards the necessary reductions.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 134</span>
Our proposal will deliver a welcome tax cut to the drivers of nearly 2 million vehicles. It puts in place an incentive and gives a clear signal to drivers to check precisely the engine size and, from next year, the CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emission level of the car that they plan to buy. It is a sensible and affordable incentive, which will help to achieve our environmental objectives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Economic Secretary has conceded that the use of engine size is an imperfect measure of emissions. As many Opposition Members said, it will do little to benefit the environment. It will also affect only a few people because it is, like so many other measures in the Budget, a gimmick. We tried to make it more serious.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geraint Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I will continue because I do not want to spend long on this.<br><br>
I happily concede that our suggestion would cost a little more than the Library first thought, although it still does not think that it would cost £400 million. The real issue will be when we consider the new scheme that will be produced in the autumn. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

RATES OF DUTY FOR GOODS VEHICLES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with VED rates for goods vehicles. It sets the VED rate for new classes of goods vehicles that were available for use on United Kingdom roads from 1 January 1999. It also increases the maximum VED concession from £500 to £1,000 for vehicles that reach stringent particulate emission standards.<br><br>
For the overwhelming majority of vehicles—much more than 90 per cent.—the rate of VED has not changed. Indeed, for most vehicles, rates have not increased since 1997 and have therefore fallen in real terms. From 1 January this year, new classes of heavy goods vehicles were allowed on British roads following the cabotage agreement that the previous Government signed. In line with the White Paper on integrated transport, last November's pre-Budget report announced our policy towards those lorries that operate at the new higher rate and which are most likely to use the road-damaging 11.5 tonne axle. We said that we intended to set VED for those lorries at rates that would strongly discourage their use. That reflects the substantial additional road damage that is caused by 11.5 tonne axles, which is up to 33 per cent, more than that caused by lorries that are loaded only to a 10.5 tonne axle weight, and 10,000 times the road damage caused by ordinary cars.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 135</span>
No one needs to pay the higher VED rates. Hauliers will only incur those costs if they decide to increase the maximum weight that their lorries are permitted to carry. There is no evidence that hauliers have to use road-damaging axles to compete with foreign counterparts. According to Road Haulage Association figures, there are not enough foreign lorries on British roads to support that argument. In any case, for many loads, including foodstuffs, the lorries are usually full before they reach the weight that would require them to pay increased VED.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Dorrell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Charnwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary confirm that, although the Government said that they would not fix the rates until the Budget, licences were sold, at the rate prevailing before the Budget, for a period extending beyond Budget day? Those licences provided operators with a right to operate beyond 17 April, which is now being withdrawn retrospectively. Operators regard the schedule as retrospective legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, we made it clear last year that we would increase the rate of VED for this particular class of lorries. An anomaly arose between 1 January, when the cabotage agreement came into effect, and Budget day, when the new rate of VED came into effect. The new rate, like other VED and tax rates, came into effect on Budget day in line with normal practice. That was clearly signalled in the pre-Budget report and surrounding statements last year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it or is it not true that those operators bought licences for a 12-month period before Budget day?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that that is so. Last year, we clearly stated our intention to increase the rate of VED, not on other lorries but on this particular class of lorry, with effect from the date of implementation of the Budget.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This discussion may be more appropriate to schedule 1, in relation to amendments and a stand part debate. Although clause 9 gives effect to schedule 1, it is probably convenient for the Committee if we confine such discussion to the schedule 1 debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful for your guidance. I thought that it might help the Committee if I started the debate. I am happy to draw my remarks on clause 9 to a conclusion.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment follows on from the debate that we did not have just now. It links with the principles behind the debate on the previous clause. Indeed, it picks up on some of the issues debated on the Floor of the House during the Conservative Opposition day on 21 April. The amendments seek to reduce VED for most classes of goods vehicles. That is the most sensible—and easiest—method, in the short term, to support the road haulage industry.<br><br>
The road haulage industry has probably been debated more times in this House over the past few weeks than in the previous decade. The industry has been hit by a series of tax increases, which are causing huge concern. Although there has been debate about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 138</span>
the extent of the problems caused and many disputes about the facts, no hon. Member who has listened to those debates can remain unconvinced that a genuine problem exists. The clearest and most celebrated example of the problem is the flagging out of some fleets of road haulage vehicles by owners who decide to license them and pay the vehicle excise duty in other countries. That is because the annual VED rates in many other European Union countries are now much lower than in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
In the United Kingdom, the VED rate that applies to the most popular goods vehicle is £3,120, compared with £670 in the Netherlands, £929 in Belgium, and £486 in France. It is not surprising, therefore, that road hauliers are considering flagging out and registering their vehicles in those countries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geraint Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us what percentage of hauliers have flagged out? I put it to him that there is no such evidence available, and that his argument is based on hearsay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did preface my remarks by saying that there is a dispute over the facts. However, it is clear from listening to road hauliers that many of them are thinking of flagging out. It is better to catch the problem before it happens; the incentives are there. If people are threatening to flag out, it is incumbent on us, as legislators, to take notice. That argument applies to all the relevant rates.<br><br>
The Minister rightly mentioned, in her remarks on clause 9, the serious environmental problems caused by 40-tonners. The Government were right to be concerned about that. However, because of the possiblity of flagging out, the Government's policies on VED may not be the most effective way of dealing with that problem. They do not affect foreign hauliers, which could put our own road haulage companies at a disadvantage by making them uncompetitive. They could also increase the possibility of flagging out by UK road hauliers who decide, for various economic and logistical reasons, to replace part of their fleet with those larger vehicles. The incentive for them to flag out as they make such replacement will be greater, because of the higher VED on 40-tonners.<br><br>
Although the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) is right to suggest that flagging out has not yet happened in large numbers, there is great potential for that to happen. The Government's proposals for all the different classes of VED on goods vehicles will result in a contagion of flagging out.<br><br>
The CBI's brief reinforces the fact that there is a problem surrounding the issue. It puts the argument into a nutshell when it concludes that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The scope for measures to mitigate the competitive damage to UK hauliers being imposed by the fiscal regime must be a priority for early action by the recently established Road Haulage Forum."</p></blockquote>
Everyone in the road haulage industry is waiting to see what comes out of that newly established forum. However, it would be wrong for use to wait until it reaches its conclusions. It is within the Government's power, if they accept our amendment, to show their

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 139</span>
commitment to the road haulage industry now. VED reductions are the best way to target support for the road haulage industry because they are a simple way to help, as some of the Government's own policies show. The Government were right to freeze VED for most classes of goods vehicles over the past two years. We are merely proposing an extension of that policy, building on the Government's own approach. Our proposals are supported by many road hauliers, and can be introduced at low cost.<br><br>
Other alternatives have been proposed in our debates—for example, the Brit disc or vignette system. Clearly, to establish that would involve up-front costs, and it could not be introduced quickly. That is why VED scores more highly, especially in the short term, as the best way of helping the road haulage industry. I hope that the Government will give the Committee some idea of how they are approaching discussions in the Road Haulage Forum and say whether they have in mind that sort of measure. It would help the road haulage industry to have an early indication of the Government's likely future policy so that it can plan for the future. If the Government cannot tell us that, those road hauliers who are deciding where to locate and register their vehicles, and whether to re-equip their fleets, will not be able to plan with certainty. I hope that the Government will support the proposals in our amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory<span class='memberconstituency'>(Wells)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to associate myself with many of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, who is right to draw attention to the extremely damaging effect of the Budget on the British haulage industry. Indeed, the Government's proposals come on top of two other tax-raising Budgets, so the damage is cumulative and serious. On the Floor of the House, we debated the impact of successively raising road fuel duty well beyond the point at which it has environmental justification. As a result, there is a severe threat to the whole British haulage industry, which is being made uncompetitive in European terms. The Government pay lip service to competitiveness. The Department of Trade and Industry even published a White Paper on competitiveness, but the Treasury is working in the opposite direction. It is piling taxes on to an international business, the effect of which is simply to drive it away. Even if it does not drive the actual businesses away, it certainly encourages distorting behaviour.<br><br>
A firm called Framptons in my constituency is now filling up in France and other continental countries with 52 per cent, of its total fuel usage, whereas that figure used to be zero. It will shortly start taking tractor units through the channel tunnel simply to take advantage of lower fuel prices on the continent. That will damage the environment because it has no productive use, but that firm is responding to a clear fiscal signal. I do not know whether that is due to ignorance on the Government's part or whether they do not care about the haulage industry. I do not think that it can be due to ignorance because they were warned, before the Budget, about the consequences of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
their actions. Therefore, I conclude that they have sacrificed the road haulage industry on the altar of increased tax revenue.<br><br>
The situation in relation to vehicle excise duty is even more bizarre because, in March of last year, the Chancellor announced a review in which he asked the industry to participate. That review was to consider the basis for the existing cost methodology and to take into account external cost. That review is not complete but, in the absence of any agreed conclusions, the Government introduced substantial increases on certain heavy lorries without any warning.<br><br>
Do the Government not understand that haulage industries must plan? Purchasing decisions take a long time. To change the composition of a haulage fleet is a large undertaking. However, instead of signalling the changes after consultation, the Government have suddenly imposed punitive levels of duty on certain vehicles, giving the industry no time in which to plan ahead or make appropriate purchasing decisions.<br><br>
In particular, the industry's anger has been directed towards the enormous increase in duty for 40-tonne vehicles with five axles. They do not constitute an obscure category—they are the primary vehicles used in international haulage and have been described as the "workhorse of Europe". All Committee members will be familiar with their presence on our roads. Vehicle excise duty in the United Kingdom is not simply higher than on the continent: it is about 10 times the rate of duty in most other member states. Currently, the cost of registering such a vehicle in this country is £5,750. In Spain, the cost is £328; in Portugal, £308; in the Netherlands, £670; in Luxemburg, £358; and in France, £486.<br><br>
The Government have introduced a grotesque distortion by levying a vehicle excise duty that is far higher than in any other European Union country. Their excuse is that they want to deter the use of such vehicles, which impose a high axle weight on roads. However, the Government failed to understand that that deterrent will not apply to foreign lorries and will therefore encourage them into this country. They cannot be stopped at the frontier—it would be illegal to do so. Foreign lorries are entering the country and use the low tax rates to which I referred to enable them to transport freight around the United Kingdom. The Government have encouraged the replacement of United Kingdom vehicles with foreign-registered vehicles. Clearly, that fits in with the Government's policy of helping foreign hauliers, but what has it to do with helping the environment?<br><br>
The Minister said that she hopes that United Kingdom hauliers will be forced to adopt the new 41-tonne category using six axles: three on the tractive unit and three on the trailer unit. Such vehicles would thereby qualify for the lower vehicle excise duty which, it should be noted, is still substantially higher than on the continent. The problem is that the new three-axle tractive units are extremely expensive, costing more than £60,000 each. Moreover, the industry has already been drained of cash by the relentless increase in road
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0090">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
fuel duty. The two-axle tractive unit, which is being replaced, has been rendered worthless by the changes to vehicle excise duty.<br><br>
As has been noted, the new, three-axle tractive units, which will qualify for the lower vehicle excise duty, are more expensive to buy and to maintain, because they use more tyres and more fuel. Despite that fact, the Government have raised fuel duty and announced that they will continue to raise it. They are erecting a deterrent against switching to the more environmentally benign three-axle tractive unit. It is madness for the Government to implement policies that clearly pull in different directions. In any case, vehicles with a 41-tonne limit cannot engage in international traffic with such a payload because it is illegal in France and many other European Union countries. Our amendments would revert excise duty on that category of vehicle to £3,210 at least until the publication of the review to which I referred.<br><br>
Denby Transport, which is based in Lincoln, calculated the extra cost that a vehicle incurs if it is registered and operates in the United Kingdom rather than France. It took account of the lower payroll cost in this country, for which no thanks are due to the Labour party, because that is an achievement that we left behind.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
The lower payroll cost is a significant benefit to United Kingdom hauliers, but Denby Transport said that that is overwhelmed in the opposite direction by the higher VED on lorries and, even more so, by higher fuel duties. It calculated that the extra cost of running a single vehicle doing average mileage for a year is a net £12,604. That is a colossal advantage to hand to its French competitors. It is madness, short sighted, anti-environmental and wrong, and our amendments would reverse that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Ruffley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bury St. Edmunds)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In rising to support the amendments, I speak on behalf of many hauliers in my constituency. In rural areas such as Bury St. Edmunds, a high proportion of small businesses are haulage companies. Their questions are in two parts. The Economic Secretary has had a go at answering some of them and I hope that she will give specific answers to the two I have for her today.<br><br>
Small haulage companies realise from the schedule and the Budget announcement that the intention is to change behaviour and, as the integrated transport White Paper states, to encourage six-axle vehicles with a maximum axle weight of 10.5 tonnes. We understand the logic of that because they cause less wear and tear on country roads and roads in general. So far, so good. My hauliers want to know about the cost. The cost of new vehicles will increase because six-axle vehicles are more expensive than five-axle vehicles. Will the Economic Secretary tell us the cost of a brand new six-axle goods vehicle of 10.5 tonnes maximum axle weight compared with a five-axle vehicle of 11.5 tonnes maximum axle weight? The question is not unfair and I am not trying to catch her out.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
Some companies realise that their business costs will increase as a direct result of the schedule and the associated clause. Taxation policy is being used to change hauliers' behaviour when they make purchasing decisions on future goods vehicles. I know that the Economic Secretary will want to give an accurate answer because, if she gets it right, my hauliers will be mightly impressed. Some of them have the impression that Treasury Ministers are making tax policy without the faintest idea about the consequences for the industry. If the Economic Secretary can get the answer right, it will show that someone in the Treasury team has done the homework.<br><br>
My second question is as follows. If the Government intend to increase the number of six-axle vehicles and phase out five-axle vehicles of 11.5 tonnes maximum axle weight, how many such vehicles does the Economic Secretary predict will be in operation next year, the year after and the year after that? There is no point in setting out policy objectives to make haulage fleets more environmentally friendly in terms of wear and tear on roads if the Economic Secretary does not have accurate projections of how many of the new vehicles will be on the road and how many five-axle vehicles of comparative weight will be taken out of use. I hope that she will answer those two specific questions in the spirit in which they were put, which was to elucidate the underlying logic of the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend's hauliers have informed him that to comply with the six-axle restrictions to pay the lower VED, it is not only a three-axle unit that has to be purchased but a three-axle trailer as well. There are two aspects to the problem. A haulier could run a three-axle vehicle with a two-axle trailer but still have to pay the increased duy of £5,000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruffley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is entirely right. The upshot of the increased costs is to make our industry, especially in East Anglia, uncompetitive in rleation to other hauliers, particularly in Holland. I hope that it will not try your patience, Mr. Butterfill, if I remind the Committee of figures that have already been given but which are important in the context of our argument that the British haulage industry is suffering a serious competitive disadvantage as a result of measures that relate to VED and fuel duty.<br><br>
The VED rates in European Union member states that I shall quote relate to 40-tonne articulated vehicles. The United Kingdom VED figure is for 38-tonne five-axle vehicles, the most typical weight in this country. At the end of 1998, VED in Belgium was £929 and in Denmark, £498. In France, VED was £486, although that figure is disputed because the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions was given the figure of £660. However, both those figures are less than the VED rate in the UK, which was £3,210. Nothing in the proposals will alleviate the crippling disparity that British road hauliers suffer in relation to their close competitors and counterparts on the continent.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0091">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 143</span>
I must tell the Economic Secretary that a couple of dozen road hauliers in my constituency, including Bacton Transport in Stowmarket, H. G. Moore and Son in Walsham-le-Willows and H. C. Wilson in Elmswell, have written to me saying that the disadvantage cannot continue. Although the Chancellor stated in June 1998 that he had no intention of lowering VED rates in this country to approximate more closely the EU average, they hoped before the Budget that he would listen to them and change his mind. I urge the Economic Secretary to explain how she and her ministerial colleagues will address the Road Haulage Forum's next meeting because its members will put the same arguments that I have outlined today stressing that the competitive disadvantage cannot continue.<br><br>
As for my two specific questions, I hope that the Economic Secretary will not go into the repetitive mode of many of her colleagues and say, "Don't worry so much about excise duties or VED. When it comes to marginal rates of corporation tax, we are a much more competitive nation than our European counterparts." That argument does not wash. The killer for companies such as mine, many of which are small family businesses, is not slicing 1 per cent, or 2 per cent, off the marginal rate of corporation tax but the crippling level of VED. The clause does nothing to alleviate that problem, although the amendments would rectify it. I look forward to the Economic Secretary's detailed response to my questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am often struck by the extent to which debates in the House and in Committee can sometimes be isolated from the marketplace in which people have to operate.<br><br>
There is increasing public concern about the effect of the Government's proposals on the road haulage industry. I feel the same sense of isolation in relation to this matter, and the Government's response to it, as I felt in relation to our debate on tobacco duty. In both debates, Ministers focused on what are no doubt rational and coherent objectives, although they are completely divorced from the broader context in which those who live under the Government's tax regime have to earn their living. In our debate on tobacco duty, more than one Labour Member leaped up thinking that they had an opportunity to embarrass the Tories and said, "The Tories are now in favour of tax harmonisation." The same point applies in this context. Do we argue that we need tax harmonisation in relation to the road haulage industry? The answer to that question is the same as it was in relation to tobacco duty: no, we are not in favour of harmonisation, although we are most assuredly in favour of the need to recognise market realities, namely, tax competition.<br><br>
Ministers say that they want a successful and profitable haulage industry, but the Government's tax policy is divorced from the marketplace in which that industry has to earn its living. The Government are in severe and immediate danger of undermining their stated objective of developing a successful, profitable industry.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 144</span>
The hon. member for Kingston and Surbiton said that there was a danger of haulage operators flagging out their vehicles, but the Government replied, "No, that has not happened yet." Do we really have to wait until half of our road haulage industry has volunteered to pay tax to a foreign Government before we recognise that the costs to which they are subject render their operations uncompetitive in an open marketplace?<br><br>
There are plenty of arguments on both sides of the House on matters European. In this context, we should move away from dogmatic arguments about being for or against any specific European policy. So far as I am aware, no hon. Members has argued against the principle of an open competitive marketplace across Europe. The Government impose costs on operators who compete in that open marketplace, but the same competitive disciplines could be applied to them. In relation to the tax system, what is the price of government? Operators have to impose that system on themselves as a result of the open competitive market.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my right hon. Friend is aware that parts of government—the Department of Trade and Industry—are aware of the point that he made about competition. Does he agree that, in relation to the Rover factory, the DTI provided launch aid to BMW of £150 million for reasons relating to competition and the marketplace in Europe? In the competitive European market, that plant could have been located elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is absolutely right—that is undoubtedly one of the reasons why the Department of Trade and Industry offered such support to BMW. He underlines the fact that the Treasury—God bless it—is divorced, as some would argue it always has been, not only from the realities of the open marketplace, but from its friends in Victoria Street. My right hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) might say that there is nothing new in that.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
The Government have proposed a set of narrowly defined tax policy objectives—which, no doubt, Ministers will justify in the terms of their Treasury brief—that are divorced from the broader context and are, therefore, undeliverable. Much worse, Treasury Ministers are pursuing objectives—blind to the implications that their policy will have in the real world—that are far removed from what they said their objectives would be and from what is written in their brief.<br><br>
I hope that when the Economic Secretary replies to the debate, we shall hear less about road track costs and environmental costs, both of which are relevant, and more about how the Government expect road haulage companies to earn a living when their competitors are subject to significantly lower costs as a result of different tax systems in an open marketplace. That is the first point that I want to make forcibly to the Economic Secretary because the Government have not addressed that issue with the appropriate seriousness.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0092">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
The second point that I hope the Economic Secretary will address is the question that I raised in my intervention during the aborted debate on clause 9. It is the question of whether the treatment of the 40-tonne, five-axle set involves retrospective taxation. There is a simple way to test that. I am sure that Treasury Ministers favour retrospective taxation no more in office than they did in opposition. All Treasury Ministers should be on their guard against elements of retrospection slipping into the tax system so that they can ensure that it does not happen. When people bought a licence for a 40-tonne, five-axle unit—made legal on 1 January—between 1 January and Budget day, did they secure the right to operate that vehicle for 12 months? I believe that they thought that they did, and the burden is on the Economic Secretary to demonstrate that they did not. If she cannot demonstrate that they did not buy the right to operate for 12 months, she will be withdrawing, retrospectively, a right that they thought they bought at the time when they bought it. That is retrospective taxation, which no Government should embrace.<br><br>
The questions for the Economic Secretary are clear. How can she expect such people to earn a living when she makes them uncompetitive and, more narrowly, how can she justify the introduction of this measure, which operators believe is retrospective taxation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodward</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I totally share the concerns raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell). Several questions need to be addressed. What have the Government got against the British road haulage industry? The overwhelming evidence is that the industry will suffer as a result of the Budget. The Economic Secretary has suggested that, so far, there is no evidence that businesses have gone abroad or gone bankrupt, but the industry has given us evidence that that will happen. The Government claim to be a friend of business and to understand the climate in which business can succeed, yet when asked by business to acknowledge the problems, they do nothing to help but simply increase taxes. If they want to maintain current levels, why introduce a new band in respect of larger tonnage vehicles? One could keep vehicles with the higher revenue weight of tractive unit in the current band of 36,000 and 38,000 kg. Why invent a new band when that could be regarded as the ceiling?<br><br>
The justification for the new band is that wear and tear on heavier vehicles is 33 per cent, higher. However, the road haulage industry estimates that almost half the traffic on our roads originates from continental companies and therefore pays no British excise duty. Nevertheless, the Government want to slap a huge extra tax on our own industry, which will render it unable to compete.<br><br>
I shall give some relevant examples from my constituency. One firm, which is small and operates only four 38-tonne lorries, wants to compete with its European competitors and recognises that it may need to work at 40 tonnes. It will have to pay extra duty amounting to approximately £2,500 per vehicle, but it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
does not make enough money to pay the extra £10,000. It wants to employ people, operate successfully, make a profit and compete with businesses in continental Europe, but the rates in this country are nearly 10 times those in France. The Government are forcing it out of business.<br><br>
Last year, Roy Betts and Son, a family-run business that was set up in Chadlington in 1929, made just £18,000 profit on a turnover of £500,000. For this year, it projects a £5,000 loss. Last year, having been in business for 70-odd years, it thought that it was doing the right thing in investing £300,000 in four new Euro 2 Volvo lorries. That is a big investment for a company with an annual turnover of £500,000. It is run by good, honest people. Nevertheless, and despite the purchase of wonderful, environmentally-friendly vehicles, it may go out of business because of the Government's decision to cripple it with a high rate of tax.<br><br>
Of course, Roy Betts and Son has a choice, which the Economic Secretary may not wish to recognise. It will probably decide to flag out, because that will be the only alternative to going bust. Perhaps it is Government policy to encourage flagging out. Clearly, when confronted with the choice between going bust or flagging out, those who are honourably engaged in trying to make a profit will try to continue. That means that, in their greed to grab that little bit more, the Government will lose all their revenue.<br><br>
I shall cite a further example of a firm in my constituency. Indeed, I could cite many others, and I suspect that every hon. Member could do so. It would be interesting to hear whether Labour Members of the Committee have received representations from businesses in their constituencies. I suspect that they have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Gardiner <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can hold my hand on my heart and say that I have not received a single representation on the points that the hon. Gentleman has raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodward</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an extraordinary statement. I do not doubt the hon. Gentleman's word, but that statement shows that his constituents do not even think it worth writing to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gardiner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way so courteously, as always. On average, I receive 75 letters a day from my constituents, which I consider to be somewhat in excess of most hon. Members. My constituents raise many issues with me, but they have not raised any of the issues that the hon. Gentleman mentions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Woodward</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We know precisely where the hon. Gentleman—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that hon. Members will not be tempted down the route of comparing the number of letters that they receive a day and that we will return to the debate on the amendments. I have been fairly lenient in allowing a wide-ranging debate on the amendments, and I shall continue to do so in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0093">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
debate on amendment No. 28, but in those circumstances, it will probably not be appropriate to debate the schedule as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Woodward</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Butterfill. You are right—we should not compare the size of our respective postbags. However, I shall mention one more example of a firm in my constituency. It is called MacBurnie International and is a sizeable firm in many ways. It runs 13 five-axle articulated lorries. It has considered the clause carefully and has reached an obvious conclusion: it must go abroad. The firm has calculated that it will save £66,950 on running its fleet if it registers in Holland. That sum will be lost to the Exchequer. There is no reason why that firm should stay registered in this country, when it can register in Holland.<br><br>
Perhaps when the Economic Secretary chooses to speak, she will tell us why MacBurnie International should remain registered in the United Kingdom. What financial reason or advantage exists for it to do so? It may go abroad not because it chooses to, but because the Government will force it out of Britain. That can hardly be described as creating a climate in which business can prosper and competition can thrive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Casale <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wimbledon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that we should lower the rate of vehicle excise duty for lorries to that of the country with the lowest level in Europe? If so, has he calculated the cost to the Exchequer of doing so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodward</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may recall that I said that I do not understand the need for an extra level. Why not tax such vehicles, which were introduced only after January because of an European Union directive, at the previous highest limit? Why introduce a new band in which the Government greedily want to charge an extra £2,500 for vehicles plated up to 40 tonnes? Why have the Government gone for that money if they know that doing so will force some firms out of business and others to go abroad and flag out? There is no point in doing that.<br><br>
Can the Economic Secretary genuinely tell the Committee that she has not received a single proposal from anyone on that issue? It is incredible that the Opposition have been inundated with protests from the road haulage industry, but Labour Members have received no representations. Although the example given by the hon. Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner) may be perfectly bona fide, it would be interesting to know whether that is the case for every Labour Member in the Committee. That would tell us that there is no point in constitutents writing to this Government about business because they are not prepared to listen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Breed</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have received representations—as, I suspect, have several hon. Members. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there are some uncomfortable similarities to the fishing industry, where companies that are located in one country often have their principal assets registered in another in order to gain significant advantage. That led to the whole business
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
of quota hopping. It was not envisaged that under the single market businesses could choose to be registered where they wish for tax so that they could register their main assets in another country to obtain its fiscal benefits.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodward</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not discuss the fishing market, although the hon. Gentleman made some fair points. However, the crucial, and final, point is that the single market exists to be fair and to allow competition to work so that all countries within the European Union can benefit. What is extraordinary about the proposal and the way in which the Government are tax-grabbing at every opportunity, prepared to put companies out of business through their greed, is that they are working against the principle of the single market. As MacBurnie International told me, its complaint is that the single market is meaningless unless its terms of trade are fair. The clause makes them unfair for business in Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Nick. St. Aubyn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Guildford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I warmly endorse my hon. Friend's comment. I am amazed by the complacency and brazenness of the Government's approach to the issue. They seem to be saying that, thanks to the golden economic legacy left them by the Conservatives, which delivered far more efficiency and far lower social costs for our businesses, they will claw back that advantage—in this as in so many other areas—by raising taxation. They seem to believe that they are good Europeans if they force as many transport costs on businesses in this country as in other parts of Europe. Are the Government not aware that the reason why, until they started getting their hands on the levers of power, we had higher growth here than on the continent was because we kept some of those costs far lower?<br><br>
My hon. Friends have explained in detail why the proposal is a threat to the road haulage industry. Several road hauliers in my constituency have written to me because they are up in arms about the proposals, while being enthusiastic about our proposed Brit tax because it would answer some of their problems if continental hauliers entering this country had to face the same barriers as we face when we go abroad.<br><br>
I also wish to address the effects of the changes on British industry in general. I remind the Committee that my own business will be affected by the level of vehicle excise duties. I used to run another business based in Cornwall; we depended on 40-tonne lorries to take our products around the country. I know that for many small businesses in the far reaches of the country—I am sorry that the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) is not present throughout our debate because I know that many businesses in Cornwall will be worried about the issue—transport costs are a big factor in their business viability. The Government wish to give more grants to some outlying regions of the country, but that is no substitute for keeping down business costs. What estimate has the Treasury team made of the number of jobs that will be lost in manufacturing business as a result of the

increase in costs? I have no doubt that it will cause haulage businesses to close, and will be the final nail in the coffin for some manufacturing businesses.<br><br>
I have a personal interest in the construction industry. Heavy weights that have little added value—such as wood, cement or steel—are carried about the country. The additional costs imposed by the higher duty sought by the Government will have an inflationary effect. Have they estimated that effect?<br><br>
Whenever the Government see an area where we have built up an economic advantage, they seek a way of undermining it. They are trying to undermine the strength and health of our economy. It is typical of Ministers' indifference and lack of understanding that they natter away as the debate continues, without a clue what we are talking about. On that note, I can do nothing else but sit down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As always, we have had a lively and interesting debate, although the arguments were rehearsed on the Floor of the House recently.<br><br>
I should start by discussing the effect of the various amendments. They would create new sets of VED rates for goods vehicles, all of which would be lower than the existing rates—I refer to the amendments that would replace the tables in schedule 1. Those tables achieve two different purposes: they freeze the VED rates for the vast majority of goods vehicles, and they set new rates for that small group of heavier vehicles that have been available for use in this country since 1 January this year.<br><br>
The rates that we have set for those heavier vehicles—40 tonnes on five axles—pursue the policy that we announced in our pre-Budget statement, which I referred to briefly on clause 9. In our pre-Budget statement last autumn, we said that rates would be set to discourage strongly the use of the heavier vehicles commonly used, with 11.5 tonne axles, in view of the significant additional road damage that they cause.<br><br>
In the 1998 Budget, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced a thorough review of VED rates for all goods vehicles, in order better to reflect the environmental impact of different vehicles. The analytical work that will underpin that review, I am sure the right hon. Member for Fylde will be pleased to hear, is under way, and will be overseen by an advisory board that includes representatives of the haulage industry. The review has not yet concluded. When it does, it will inform our future decisions on VED rates for goods vehicles.<br><br>
In advance of that review, we have sought to set VED rates on as fair and consistent a basis as we can. We are freezing the rates for more than 90 per cent, of lorries, and increasing them for the new, very damaging class of lorries that has been allowed on our roads only since 1 January.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodward</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary explain how it is reasonable and fair for those running such lorries to be paying nearly 10 times what their competitors in continental Europe pay?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that point and answer it precisely, but first I want to say more about the amendments, because we have heard very little about them from the hon. Members who tabled them.<br><br>
The rates set out in the amendments are arbitrary and lack a rational basis. In many cases, they would cut VED from the rates that applied before the Budget. They raise the spectre of lorries, including large vehicles such as a 38-tonne six-axle articulated lorry with a reduced pollution certificate, being subject to less VED than a family car or a light lorry. It cannot be right that light vans under 3.5 tonnes should cost £60 more in VED than vehicles of between 3.5 and 7.5 tonnes. Yet that is the implication of the amendments, with all the consequent market distortions. It is difficult to believe that that is the aim of Opposition Members.<br><br>
At least one of the rates proposed in amendment No. 51 conflicts with European law. Directive 93 of 1989 sets minimum VED rates for goods vehicles, most of which are extremely low. The rate of £150 set out in amendment No. 51 for a 41 to 44 tonne six-axle lorry is clearly below the European Union minimum of 336 euros—equivalent to about £220—for such lorries. The amendment is defective. Its main justification, as offered by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), the right hon. Members for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) and for Charnwood, the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton and others, is competitiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary said that the vehicles that are to pay the increased rates of vehicle excise duty are more damaging to the road and more costly to run. What are the annual road track costs for that weight of vehicle, and what are the costs for the next lightest vehicle?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The 40 tonne, five-axle lorry imposes about £2,500 more in road track costs than the 38 tonne equivalent, which is why it will cost £2,500 more in VED.<br><br>
Contrary to what is said constantly by Opposition Members, the British road haulage industry is competitive. Most British hauliers operate within the British market and, because they are so effective, they face little competition from foreign hauliers. Indeed, the latest available figures show that less than 1 per cent, of total journeys are undertaken by foreign hauliers. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport and I have said repeatedly in other debates that competitiveness must be considered on the basis of the total business costs facing a firm if it operates here or abroad.<br><br>
The total business costs for a typical firm might be £600,000 higher in the Netherlands and £820,000 higher in Belgium. The problem facing the industry is not competitiveness, but overcapacity. We are discussing that and related problems with the industry in the forum that we have set up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady is satisfied that that is the case, has the Treasury conducted any studies into the extra journeys that will be undertaken by foreign haulage companies as a result of the Budget?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0095">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 151</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing that issue with the industry in the forum. We have invited it to make information on that point available to us. As I said in the House the other day, we have undertaken to consider the proposal made in various quarters, including by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, for a British disc—a Euro vignette. However, because so few foreign hauliers operate here, it is not clear that the costs of introducing it would be covered by the revenue raised.<br><br>
As for the increased rate of VED for the most damaging 40-tonne, five-axle lorry, I stress that we are not forcing hauliers to pay increased rates. Various options are available to them, one being to fit an extra axle and to take advantage of the lower frozen rate of VED for a six-axle lorry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruffley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the average cost of fitting an extra axle?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The cost is about £2,000—about the same as the reduction in vehicle excise duty that would result from fitting it. It would therefore pay for itself in the first year. Hauliers have the option of using a 41-tonne, six-axle lorry which would have the same payload but a lower rate of vehicle excise duty, and of running at lower weights; a relatively small proportion of lorry journeys are made at maximum payload. If hauliers want to use 40-tonne, fixe-axle vehicles but need to run the maximum weight for only parts of the year, they have the option of licensing at the higher rate for only the month or months that they need to do so. In response to requests from the industry, we have made that process much simpler administratively.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodward</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary talks about options, but what sort of option is there when the maximum weight allowed in most EU countries, including France, is 40 tonnes? What sort of option is it for hauliers to have a 41-tonne vehicle if they want to compete with their European counterparts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not the only country that has weight limits of more than 40 tonnes. Hauliers in many other EU countries operate vehicles at more than 40 tonnes, but when they make journeys into countries such as France and Germany, they must run at a lower weight limit to comply with regulations in those countries. In any case, only a small minority of British-registered hauliers travel abroad. There is no reason why they should not be encouraged to use the more environmentally friendly 41-tonne lorries in the United Kingdom. Moreover, most lorries travelling to the continent carry light goods and are loaded well within the weight limits, so they should not be affected.<br><br>
I shall try again to reassure the right hon. Member for Charnwood about retrospection, to which he referred both in this debate and on clause 9. If a vehicle has up-plated to the new higher limits and has been relicensed between 1 January and 9 March, there is no obligation on the firm to relicence at the new rate until the licence expires. The requirement to license at the new rates applies to a vehicle that was up-plated
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 152</span>
between 1 January and 9 March but was not relicensed at the old rates during that period. In such circumstances, the firm involved will indeed need to relicense at the new rates. Similarly, if a vehicle has been run at the new higher rate without up-plating, as is allowed under the regulations that will remain in force until 31 December, it will also be liable to the higher rate. However, that is not retrospective, and is consistent with what we have said.<br><br>
That table of vehicle excise duty rates in schedule 1 freezes vehicle excise duty for the vast majority of vehicles. Increasing vehicle excise duty for a small group of extremely environmentally damaging vehicles is entirely consistent with our environmental objectives. I hope that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton will withdraw the amendment, which, for the reasons that I have outlined, is simply unacceptable. If he feels unable to do so, I must urge my hon. Friends to vote against it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister of Transport has a different message when he speaks at the dinner for the Road Haulage Association tonight. I was not convinced by the Economic Secretary's arguments. Indeed, they seemed inconsistent. On one level, she assures the Committee that the road haulage industry in this country is competitive, but on another she says that there is overcapacity. If the industry were as competitive as she says, surely it would be knocking the socks off our competitors and would not have an overcapacity problem. Her argument is illogical.<br><br>
I was not convinced by the way in which the hon. Lady answered the debate. Many of our arguments were about the need to compensate road hauliers for the extra taxes that they pay because of the fuel duty excalator. We debated how the escalator is affecting the ordinary motorist, but it is affecting the road haulage industry much more severely. The Government seem to feel that their policy of freezing is sufficient—a view that is not shared by the industry.<br><br>
The Economic Secretary did not really deal with the issue of the 40 tonners, which was addressed in a Conservative amendment. Although the Government are right to be concerned about that environmental problem, we feel that their approach will not solve it, and will make flagging out more likely.<br><br>
Comments on the Brit disc and Euro vignette were welcome, but I hope that the Government will make haste in their discussions on those proposals with the road haulage forum and others, and will come to the House as soon as possible with a proposal. I think that the right hon. Member for Wells talked about the need for the industry to plan ahead, but unless it knows all the different aspects of the fiscal regime facing it, it will not be able to do so.<br><br>
Our amendments, setting out different rates of duty, were tabled with the aim of probing the Government to see what the future direction of the policy would be. We believe that vehicle excise duty is one of the key weapons that the Government could use to assist the road hauliers in the future. I would be grateful if the Economic Secretary would be a little clearer, make remarks to that effect and suggest to the road haulage

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 153</span>
industry, which will pay particular attention to the debate, whether VED is one of the tools that the Government have in mind to help it in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In replying to the debate, the Economic Secretary seemed more concerned to point out some alleged deficiencies in the details of our amendments than to deal with the substance of the issue. She showed complacency on a staggering scale in calling the British haulage industry competitive, as though that gave her a licence to do her best to make it uncompetitive. Through its own efforts over many years, working with the previous Government, it has achieved a competitive position on the continent, which the present Government are doing their best to undermine.<br><br>
On an almost daily basis, British hauliers report a loss of business to continental haulage companies for the transfer of freight to and from the continent. That is a serious situation that the Economic Secretary must be aware of, but which she cares little about. Instead, she lives in a fantasy world where other lower taxes somehow offset the extraordinary increase in vehicle excise duty and fuel duties that she has put through in successive Budgets.<br><br>
I gave an example provided by a haulier called Denby, who had made that precise calculation and fairly taken into account the lower payroll and other taxes. He reported that those were overwhelmed by the higher vehicle excise duty and fuel taxes. The Minister completely ignores the evidence presented to her own Department and others, which contradicts what she has alleged.<br><br>
Finally, the Economic Secretary calls the 40-tonne lorries running on five axles extremely environmentally damaging. Why then does she allow them to come in from other countries without any penalty, check or hindrance? If they are damaging, they should not be allowed. If they are allowed, British industry should not be put at a competitive disadvantage. In the light of the wholly unsatisfactory nature of her replies, I shall press amendment No. 43 to a division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of courtesy, I shall respond to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton and repeat the point I made earlier. We are undertaking a review of the environmental basis of lorry VED. We are currently putting the evidence together for that review with the help of the industry. However, if he is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 154</span>
proposing further tax cuts as a result of a new and more environmentally sensitive system of lorry VED, I again challenge him as to where the money for that is to be found.<br><br>
My response to the right hon. Member for Wells is that I have spoken generally on the issue of competitiveness. I simply stress the fact that in schedule 1 we are making a real cut in VED on the vast majority of lorries. As for 40-tonne, five-axle lorries being allowed on British roads, that is the effect of the cabotage agreement signed by the Conservative Government—an agreement to which we are committed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not say whether the review would result in lower VED rates. That is to be regretted. My hon. Friends and I support the amendment proposed by the official Opposition, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
