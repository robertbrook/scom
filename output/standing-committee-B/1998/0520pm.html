	<div class='title'>MAINTENANCE PAYMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 96, in page 16, line 40, leave out subsection (7).—	<i>[Mr. Heathcoat-Amory.]</i></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are considering amendment No. 97, in schedule 20, page 157, column 3, leave out lines 23 to 28.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wells)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the end of this morning's sitting we were debating the proposed withdrawal of tax relief on maintenance payments. I was complaining about the inadequacy of the Paymaster General's response to our debate and, in particular, about the excuse that she offered that the withdrawal of married couples allowance left an unfairness, because the existing tax relief on maintenance payments would reward marriages that had broken down. I was pointing out that that is a bizarre justification. It amounts to saying that, because the Government have penalised one set of taxpayers, it is unfair if they do not penalise another. We do not agree that it was right to withdraw married couples allowances, but that does not justify the withdrawal of tax relief on maintenance payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seem obsessed with creating a quality of misery for all taxpayers, believing that an increase in one area justifies an increase in another. That is faulty logic, particularly as there is no necessary or close connection between the two allowances. The fact that married couples have until now received an allowance called married couples allowance does not mean that its demise necessitates the withdrawal of a separate tax relief on maintenance payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another excuse that was offered by several Labour Members was that it was simply another tax change and that those suffering could alter their affairs and change their savings or tax liabilities to suit the new situation. Such arguments have been advanced in a number of other debates, notoriously when the Government abolished the repayment of dividend tax credits to non-taxpayers. The Government said that those affected could switch their investments out of shares and into other forms of savings. That may technically be possible, but they were referring to
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
possibly the poorest and least sophisticated group of savers in Britain—often elderly people who have a few shares. It is inappropriate to expect them to rush off and consult an adviser to take out individual savings accounts or whatever it may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that was a somewhat cynical response, it is entirely inappropriate in this case, because the clause deals with people who may be paying and receiving money under court orders. Therefore, it is impossible for them to adjust their payments without returning to a court for a variation order, and we all know that that is a lengthy, uncertain and expensive procedure. The Government are deliberately, unnecessarily and retrospectively interfering with arrangements made many years ago under court orders. We maintain that that is unfair and unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the completely inadequate reply that we have received, we intend to divide the Committee on the main amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaun Woodward 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Witney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. I do not know whether you have heard from the Paymaster General since we discovered this morning that there may be a lacuna in the Government's intended arrangements for widows benefits and for the changes to the widows bereavement allowance. Has the Paymaster General told you whether she has been able to discover whether the Library research paper was right to suggest that a particularly large group of people will suffer severe financial hardship as a result of the changes that the Government will introduce?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, that is not a point of order for me. The Paymaster General must decide whether she wants to address that problem in Committee. No doubt, she will seek to catch my eye should she wish to say something on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>349</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Whittingdale 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Maldon and East Chelmsford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. I wish to raise a separate matter that is a point of order for the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you will be aware, Mr. Butterfill, the proceedings of the Committee are of considerable interest not just to those of us who are lucky enough to serve on the Committee, but to many people outside, who follow what is said—particularly by Ministers—with close interest. I have received complaints that some people have found it difficult to obtain copies of the 	<i>Hansard</i> report of our proceedings until a considerable time has passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding is that the proceedings of the Finance Bill Committee are second in priority only to proceedings in the Chamber. However, some people found that the report of our proceedings last Thursday was not available until the beginning of this week. That is much longer than is usually the case. Could you, Mr. Butterfill, look into the matter to see whether things could be speeded up so that people can find out relatively quickly what has been said?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will look into the matter and I raise it with the appropriate authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Dorrell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Charnwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Butterfill. The points raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Witney (Mr. Woodward) and for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) are closely related. There was a dispute this morning about what precisely the Paymaster General said in her response to some important questions about whether the Government were delivering this package to widows on one date or on two separate dates with a gap between them. The Paymaster General says that she said one thing and Opposition Members heard her to say something quite different—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already ruled on that matter. If the Paymaster General wishes to catch my eye to clarify the position she is at liberty to do so on a point of order. I have said that I will look into the publication of 	<i>Hansard</i> and I will endeavour to see that publication not just of that item but of all the reports of our proceedings is expedited as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to challenge that in any way, Mr. Butterfill. I was simply going to suggest that for the good order of the Committee and to ensure that its deliberations are available to the public, the Paymaster General has the opportunity to set out this disputed issue in writing so that the public can see what the Government's position is today—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Gentleman is questioning what I am saying and I have already made it clear that I will give the Paymaster General the opportunity to make a statement, should she wish to do so. Alternatively she can always put in writing the matter that the right hon. Gentleman mentions. However, that is not a matter for the Chair, and he knows that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>350</span>
	<p>	<i>Clause 33 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 34 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 35</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>WITHDRAWAL OF RELIEF FOR INTEREST ON LOANS TO BUY LAND ETC</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause abolishes MIRAS. We object in principle to measures that increase the burden of taxation further on the British people, because it is being done in breach of a clear promise before the election that the Government would do no such thing. Tax increases already announced and commitments already made will increase the burden of taxes on the British people by some £40 billion over the lifetime of this Parliament. We look for all opportunities to stop this tide and, where possible, to reverse it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore take a very critical view of a clause that withdraws tax relief on mortgage interest. It has been restricted in recent years and currently stands at 10 per cent, on qualifying loans up to £30,000. It is one thing to restrict or limit tax relief if that is done in the context of a commitment and a mission to cut the burden of taxes overall. It is quite another to try to end a tax relief simply to raise money and, in the context of an overall project, to raise the burden of taxes on the public, particularly as many other taxes that have been raised hit the property sector and home owners in particular. I refer specifically to the three increases in stamp duty that we have seen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We look for opportunities to halt this tax-raising project and we oppose the clause on those grounds. I have a more specific question for the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Love 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edmonton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question to Opposition Members is about the interference of MIRAS in the free market in housing. Do they agree that that system deformed housing tenure choice, and do they continue to support it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course. Tax reliefs can have a distorting effect, but I doubt whether it can seriously be suggested that 10 per cent, tax relief on loans up to £30,000 has the distorting effect that the hon. Gentleman suggests. It can happen, certainly in theory, and in practice it has sometimes happened, but given the present level of relief, that is neither an objection nor a reason for abolishing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question for the Minister is about company employees who have season ticket loans given by their employers. I am not referring to football club season tickets, but to tickets for public transport. This serious representation has been made to us because the result of hitting these loans might be to drive people from public transport into cars, which would be contrary to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>351</span>
what the Government have in mind. After all, in clause 45 of the Bill, the Government's expressed aim is to encourage the use of public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The abolition of MIRAS will have the unintended side effect of hitting such loans. This is because, at the moment, most season ticket loans fall below the £5,000 threshold, therefore do not give rise to taxation. But if mortgages cease to qualify for tax relief, they will be aggregated—if they were lent by an employer—with other loans such as those to buy season tickets. The overall total will certainly rise above £5,000, which will render ticket loans taxable. That would be an unfortunate unintended consequence. Will the Minister confirm that if the Government agree that that would be undesirable, they will, without delay, take measures to correct the damage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has made comments that I intended to make about the ending of MIRAS and the tax position of benefits in kind such as loans for season tickets. Continuing my right hon. Friend's argument, I should be interested to hear why the Government did not carve out a specific provision to exempt benefits in kind. An employee, in, say, a bank or building society might have obtained a loan to buy a house at a preferential rate of interest. The ending of the provision in this clause and other clauses for such loans to qualify for MIRAS will mean that beneficial loans will fall into the same category as loans that might be had to buy a season ticket, as my right hon. Friend said. The possibly unintended effect of ending MIRAS will be the washing out from tax relief loans of up to £5,000, which, under existing provisions, are exempt from tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should this small concession now be so effective, especially for those working in finance or banking who had loans from their companies at beneficial rates to help them buy their house? Those loans were categorised as qualifying for MIRAS but now, with its removal, they are of the sort that will be affected by the benefit-in-kind legislation. Will the Paymaster General explain the Government's position on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee should not allow the demise of MIRAS to pass without some recognition of the work of those from all political parties who campaigned for its abolition over many years. People campaigned against it because it distorted the housing market and caused inflation, which resulted in higher interest rates for the wider economy, hitting manufacturing industry and jobs. As the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) said, it also caused problems within the housing market, favouring one form of tenure over another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Love</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: According to the Council for Mortgage Lenders, another body that does not support the continuation of MIRAS, house price inflation rose by around 5 per cent, because of the subsidy. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the abolition of MIRAS will have a beneficial effect on the housing market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>352</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do, indeed. I was arguing that the beneficial effect goes even wider than the housing market and will be felt by the wider economy. The abolition of MIRAS is a welcome measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised at the remarks of the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory). His Government saw a considerable reduction in MIRAS over several years and many Conservatives believed that it should have been abolished many years ago. It was kept on by a few people who misunderstood free market economics, and the Conservatives effectively left it to the Labour Government to pursue free market policies within the housing market. I am therefore surprised that the right hon. Gentleman did not stand up today to apologise—to industry and to the British people—for retaining a subsidy that had such a dreadful effect on the housing market and the wider economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Love</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman again and apologise for intervening a second time. Whenever "MIRAS" is mentioned, it conjures up a vision of Cabinet Ministers who wanted at least to reduce MIRAS, sat around the Cabinet table being handbagged by Mrs. Thatcher to continue it. Did it not take the abolition of Mrs. Thatcher to start the process of the abolition of MIRAS?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tempting though it is to go down that road, I am sure that I would be ruled out of order if I did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who defended MIRAS for so long did so in the name of supporting home owners, but they betrayed home owners because the net result was higher interest rates. Those who wanted to defend home ownership should have developed completely different policies such as stable macroeconomic management buttressed by an independent central bank. I am pleased to say that the Labour Government borrowed that policy from the Liberal Democrat manifesto. We have not yet heard whether the Tories are going to fight the next election on renationalising the bank or keeping it. We await hearing about that with some interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Sally Keeble 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Northampton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not got my handbag here, but I was quite a supporter of MIRAS. Many of my constituents received it— obviously, given that 70 per cent, of them are home owners. The Labour Government are able to get rid of it without detrimental effects because they have got rid of boom and bust. We have low inflation and low interest rates. Had the Liberal Democrats supported us consistently on the economy, they could claim with a bit more credit that they support us on MIRAS as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be interested to see whether the hon. Lady votes for this clause. She makes a rather odd point in trying to suggest that Liberal Democrats do not support the most important policy of getting rid of boom and bust. That policy was in our manifesto, but not in the Labour party's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>353</span>
I shall return to the issue of interest rates, and the hon. Lady may support my points on that. One of the best ways of ensuring that interest rates are low for home owners and for industry is not a tax relief scheme but for the United Kingdom economy to join Euroland. If we do that, we shall have low interest rates. At the moment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying very far from the clause. Will he direct his remarks to the subject of the debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me, as a young Member of the House, to question your ruling, Mr. Butterfill—[HON. MEMBERS: "YOU are losing your hair."] I am not losing my rag.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing a relief for home owners. Interest rates are a key issue in their finances and the package that they must consider. If we want lower interest rates in the short, medium and long terms, we must ensure that this country enjoys the low interest rates that are enjoyed in Euroland, which are nearly 3 per cent. lower than in the United Kingdom. If the right hon. Member for Wells really supports home ownership, he should reconsider his and the Conservative party's views on the euro. Liberal Democrats believe that home ownership is important. The best way to encourage it is to ensure stable macroeconomics and low interest rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people want to use the tax and benefits system to support home owners and to help people who have trouble paying their mortgages. The best way to do that is to target resources in a completely different way from mortgage tax relief. My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) was once a senior researcher at the Insititute for Fiscal Studies and he produced a proposal for a mortage benefit scheme. It would have ensured that, when people moved from unemployment into work, they had support for their mortgage payments in the transition period. At present, the benefits system provides support for mortgage payments only for people on income support. They lose that support when they return to employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Love</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his forbearance. I shall be interested to see whether the official Opposition confirm that they will re-introduce MIRAS, should they be in the fortunate position of winning an election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing how to replace MIRAS with a more effective benefit. Is not a housing allowance, which has been suggested by several housing groups and which would cover all forms of tenure and support low-income owner-occupiers, by far the most effective way of encouraging home ownership?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) will not be tempted down that road. We are in danger of straying still further from the clause under discussion. Hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be delighted to do that, Mr. Butterfill. However, I thought that, on this historic day when we are discussing the abolition of MIRAS, we should debate how we can assist home ownership. That is why—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has plenty of opportunities in the House to secure a debate on home ownership. This is not the place. We are discussing a particularly fine issue here. Will the hon. Gentleman confine his remarks to it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Butterfill. I am about to conclude my remarks, and I shall be happy to do what you say. I simply wanted to reassure the Government that if the official Opposition call for a Division on the clause, we shall support the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton for his final comment. I did not have to sigh with great relief at the prospect of the Liberal Democrats voting with the Government this time, but I know that his party has long argued for the abolition of MIRAS. Indeed, their party leader welcomed its abolition in the Budget debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to intrude into the personal grief of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton or the right hon. Member for Wells with regard to their views on Europe, although I should warn the hon. Gentleman that the right hon. Gentleman has robust views. We shall be able to hear them if they step outside to exchange those views, but they are not relevant in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 35 and schedule 4 together deal with the withdrawal of mortgate interest relief, a process begun by the Conservative Government in 1988. During the Conservatives' time in office, they cut the relief seven times, and its value has been reduced so much that it is now worth an average of only £2.50 a week. As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, like my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has said, over the past year short-term and long-term interest rates have fallen considerably, so now is the right time to make this change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>. Will the Paymaster General give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the Budget proposals have been widely welcomed. Michael Coogan, the director-general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"with mortgage rates at their current low levels borrowers will be in a better position to absorb the rise in their mortgage payments next year."</p></blockquote>
The Halifax said that the changes would have little effect on the housing market. Midland Mortgages said
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>355</span>
that the abolition of MIRAS was unlikely to damage the mortgage market. Richard Best, director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are pleased to see a level playing field between the owner-occupied and the renting sectors of the housing market."</p></blockquote>
The Abbey National said of MIRAS:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Its value has been eroded, it is a distortion in the market, and the impact will be offset by changes to personal taxes."</p></blockquote>
Even the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer is on record as saying that MIRAS has outlived its usefulness, should be abolished and the sooner it happens, the better. We also know the Liberal Democrats' views. Therefore the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Liberal Democrats, Government Members and those involved with the housing market have welcomed abolition of MIRAS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Members for Wells and for Fylde (Mr. Jack) asked about loans that employers can offer to employees for a range of benefits such as season tickets. Loans up to a maximum of £500 are outside benefit-in-kind taxation. Where an employee has both a mortgage loan and a season ticket loan on favourable terms from his employer, the benefit of the cheaper loan is generally taxable, but there is an exemption if the total loan is £5,000 or less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation will not change for a person who has a season ticket loan for less than £5,000 and no other loans. The benefit in kind legislation will apply to a person who has a loan for a mortgage from his employer at a beneficial rate and a preferential loan for a season ticket—or for anything else—and who receives MIRAS. Whether someone will be affected depends on how many preferential loans he has received from his employer, including, in this context, a loan for a mortgage. If he stays under the £5,000 limit, the position will not change, but if he goes over that limit the benefit in kind legislation will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposal is entirely reasonable. Provisions elsewhere in the tax system deal with benefits in kind that are provided by employers to employees. The position of season ticket holders will not change, unless the loan exceeds £5,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General accurately described the technical consequences that will arise when a beneficial loan for a mortgage is aggregated with, for example, the loan for a season ticket. However, she did not answer my question, which was why the Government did not carve out an arrangement, perhaps only for a specific period, to ring fence or to safeguard the position of people who currently enjoy the benefit of tax-free status on a loan that their company gave them, for example, for a season ticket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in a slightly perverse situation. Later clauses will allow someone to enjoy tax free the benefits of riding on the work bus, which means that more people will be on the roads. However, if I have correctly understood the Government's environmental and transport policies, they want fewer people on the roads. The removal of the tax concession, through the mechanisms that the Paymaster General accurately described, could dissuade someone from seeking a
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>
loan for a season ticket, because he knows that he can get a tax-free ride on the works bus. What does she make of that conundrum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman did not mean to make a joke about free rides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an employee has a preferential loan from his employer for a season ticket that is less than £5,000, he will fall under the limit in the benefit in kind legislation. He might exceed the limit only if he had several different loans, including a home loan. The right hon. Gentleman knows that the benefit in kind legislation is complicated, but it ensures that people pay the proper tax and does not involve the pay-as-you-earn system in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policy does not involve a conflict. As the right hon. Gentleman rightly said, we can discuss the relevant matters later. We have announced a reform of the company car tax regime, which will apply from April 2002 and which will be based on CO2 emissions. We are encouraging the development of green transport with a package of seven targeted tax measures. We previously discussed our proposals to reduce vehicle excise duty for smaller cars and for more fuel-efficient cars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were not convinced of the need to make an exception for the small number of people who already benefit from a cheaper loan from their employers. Provided that they remain under the £5,000 limit, their position will not change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a genuine spirit of seeking information, may I ask the Paymaster General two questions? First, will she set out the seven times that the previous Government cut MIRAS, to which she referred? Secondly, she calculated that MIRAS is worth, on average, £2.50 a week. According to the explanatory notes, the typical mortgage interest rate is 5.5 per cent. Can she confirm whether her calculation of the value of MIRAS is based on that figure, and, if so, where can I obtain a such a mortgage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman really wants to endure the pain of having those cuts read into the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, well—be it on his own head. In 1988, relief was limited to £30,000 per resident. In the same year, relief was abolished on home improvement loans, on the purchase of homes for former or separated spouses, and on the purchase of homes for dependent relatives. In 1989, the rate of relief for borrowers' marginal rate of tax was reduced to the basic rate. In 1994–95, it was reduced from 25 per cent, to 20 per cent.; and in 1995–96, it was reduced from 20 per cent, to 15 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I misunderstood the right hon. Member for Wells, but he seemed to say that the Opposition oppose further cuts in MIRAS because it should be seen in the context of the overall tax burden. In 1995–96 the overall tax burden was the same as in 1979, but, as the Paymaster
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>357</span>
General has demonstrated, the previous Government made numerous cuts in and changes to MIRAS. I find it difficult to reconcile those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is up to the right hon. Member for Wells to answer that. There is a limit to the amount of pain that should be inflicted on the Opposition with regard to their record in government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford asked about the average rate of 5.5 per cent. That takes into account all available rates, including discounts. I doubt whether the hon. Gentleman wants me to advise him on his mortgage and I am not about to do so. He is perfectly capable of sorting out such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case is clearly made for the abolition of MIRAS. The clause is widely welcomed and I look forward to even Conservative Members voting for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition continually accuse the Government of imposing stealth taxes, but they appear to be unaware of the seven decreases in MIRAS during the previous Conservative Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the benefit of Opposition Members, we should resist discussing the 22 tax rises and return to the substance of the Bill. I am sure that no Labour Member will miss an opportunity to highlight the achievement or otherwise of the previous Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has shown that the attempted justification for the abolition of MIRAS is as nothing compared with the enormous tax-raising project on which the Government have embarked. Our efforts to stop this almost weekly breach of the Labour party's pre-election promise not to increase taxes at all may be no more than a gesture, but they are none the less important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall therefore vote against the clause, which also gives us the opportunity to separate our position from that of the Liberal Democrats. Their solution to the issue of interest rates would be to hand over the entire matter to the European central bank—which does not even attempt to get interest rates correct for this country—thereby making the situation worse rather than better. We will therefore divide the Committee on the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>WITHDRAWAL OF RELIEF FOR INTEREST ON NEW ANNUITY LOANS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 106, in clause 37, page 18, line 34, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>'the conditions in paragraphs (aa) and (a)'</p></blockquote>
and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'the conditions in paragraph (a)'.</p></blockquote>
I should point out that the amendment refers to clause 37, but it may be convenient for debating purposes to discuss it with clause 36 stand part. If an hon. Member wishes to press the amendment to a vote he may do so at the appropriate time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been debating the abolition of mortgage interest relief. Clause 36 abolishes another relief—that on loans taken out to buy life annuities when the loans are secured on the main residence of the person concerned. That seems to conflict with the Government's professed aim to encourage self reliance, and we have heard a lot from them about welfare reform. We know that they are failing to reform the welfare state systematically and that the flat level of expenditure that we left behind has been converted to an annual increase in social security expenditure of some 3.2 per cent. over the next three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is against that background of failure to reform the welfare state that we must examine critically any measures that might encourage people to rely more on the state and less on their own actions to build up funds and assets for their old age and retirement. Removing tax relief on the purchase of life annuities seems to be contradictory and requires an explanation from the Paymaster General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>360</span>
The second issue concerns timing and the abolition of MIRAS. MIRAS will be abolished from 6 April next year, but tax relief on loans to buy life annuities takes place from 9 March this year—from Budget day. It seems strange that those matters were not aligned. Consistency and symmetry demand that if similar tax reliefs are to be abolished, it should be done on the same day. The Government may complain that that would invite forestalling, but, given the 10 per cent. rate that applies, it is unlikely that there will be a rush on new annuity loans before next April. The Government should provide further explanation. Although the Opposition's amendments and questions are probing, the Government should give serious consideration to the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to associate myself with many of the right hon. Gentleman's remarks. We must consider the social policy issue of how to assist elderly people to realise the value of their savings within the capital value of their houses. That is an important factor in tackling pensioner poverty and other aspects of pensioner finances. I accept that there may be better ways than providing relief for such annuities—many alternatives were proposed by the recent royal commission, and those are being debated. Will the Minister tell the Committee what the Treasury—or any other Government Department—regards as the best option? New annuity loans are helpful to elderly people and, as the right hon. Gentleman said, they are in line with what the Government say they want to encourage. Before we get rid of the incentive under discussion, the Government should say whether there are alternative ways of realising pensioners' property assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a personal experience of this matter, as my grandmother was living in a property valuable enough to more than double her income. I explained to her the financial plans that were available, but it was hard to persuade her of their merits. She found the concept difficult to understand, despite my attempts over a number of years to explain how she could realise and spend her wealth rather than leave it to me or my brothers. That showed me the barriers that stop elderly people realising their wealth and enjoying it in their lifetime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue before us is important in terms of assisting elderly people to have dignity in retirement. I hope that the Paymaster General can assure the Committee that the Government have some thoughts about how to provide such help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause makes changes to the legislation on mortgage interest relief on loans to buy life annuities. The changes withdraw the relief for new loans with effect from Budget day. In response to the first question asked by the right hon. Member for Wells, the Government chose to withdraw the relief on Budget day because a longer period might encourage people to use such vehicles. We followed the practice of the previous Conservative Government, who used a similar cut-off point when changes to the rules in mortgage interest relief for home improvement loans were announced.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton and the right hon. Member for Wells asked how widely used the vehicle is by elderly people who want to release capital from their homes, and whether any alternatives exist. It simply is not true that the effect of the measure will be to destroy the home income plan market. In fact, less than 15 per cent, of home income plans qualify for mortgage interest relief. There are about 10,000 plans in total, which means that a couple of hundred plans are being taken out each year. One of the main providers of home income plans, a representative of a company called Stalwart, said that withdrawal of the relief would not destroy the home income plan market. Cathy Horsley, the market manager at Stalwart, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are delighted that existing mortgate/annuity plan members will have their MIRAS relief for the rest of their lives."</p></blockquote>
People with such plans will also be able to move home without their plans being affected, but we shall discuss that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton asked about other ways of realising assets. Those issues are being addressed as part of the on-going discussions between the Inland Revenue and the mortgage providers in order to ensure the smooth abolition of MIRAS and ensure that we do nothing inadvertently that would be detrimental to people who already have home income plans. It is not for me, a finance Minister, to advise or suggest, but the hon. Gentleman will be aware that there are several different plans on the market that enable people to take capital out of their homes. They do not all attract tax relief but, none the less, they provide a better and more popular way of allowing elderly people to take capital out of homes that they have paid for, perhaps to carry out repairs or to pay for other things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is simply not true that this provision sounds the death knell for old people being able to take money out of their houses. This is not an attack on pensioners, as the right hon. Member for Wells said yet again—quite the opposite. We have preserved the position for people who already have plans, even if they move house. The issue of how people can take capital out of their houses is already widely dealt with by the financial market. There are already several different ways in which people can achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Home income plans have not been without controversy, surrounding the issue of whether, as a way of taking equity out of property, they provide best value for money. I shall not say specifically why the amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Wells is defective. He said that it was a probing amendment, but it does not do what he said it would do. It was supposed to accompany other amendments that have not been selected and, therefore, it cannot achieve its intended purpose. If the right hon. Gentleman intends to press it to a vote, I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CONDITIONAL ACQUISITION OF SHARES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 156, in page 20, line 18, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) In section 120(5A)(a) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 omit "acquisition or".</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(4B) Section 149B of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 shall be omitted.'.</p></blockquote>
This clause undoes some of the incompetently presented sections in the Finance Act 1998. Clauses 39 and 40 amend some of last year's changes. The amendment would help the Government by ensuring that the correct consequential changes are implemented. It was recommended by the Chartered Institute of Taxation, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In view of the repeal by Clause 39(2) of the 'acquisition charge' under section 140A(2), we would suggest that the words 'acquisition or' in section 120(5A)(a) Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 and the whole of section 149B"</p></blockquote>
of that Act
	<br><blockquote><p>"should be deleted."</p></blockquote>
I agree with that. Does the Paymaster General?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Butterfill. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] Yes, this one falls to the Economic Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer is no. It might assist the hon. Gentleman and the Committee if I give a fuller explanation. As he said, clause 39 amends the tax provisions for employees who are paid in shares that they may later forfeit. It will no longer be possible for a double charge to arise when an employee first receives such shares. The provisions in last year's Finance Act ensured that employees who receive shares, subject to forfeiture, are taxed on a fair and sensible basis. However, the way in which the provisions are structured makes it possible for a double income tax charge to arise once under these provisions and again under other provisions of the tax code. Although that is not common, it could arise when an employee exercises an option over shares that are subject to a risk of forfeiture. Clause 39 deals with that problem. It ensures that a double charge to tax can no longer arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first part of amendment No. 156 deletes the words "acquisition or". That is not necessary or harmful because, in light of the other changes that we are making, they are not needed. The difficulty with the amendment arises from the proposed omission of section 149B of the 1992 Act. The hon. Gentleman should withdraw the amendment because it would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>363</span>
allow an employee in the situation that I have described to get excessive deductions for capital gains tax in some circumstances and to pay less tax than would be fair. Section 140A, as amended by clause 39, will apply a charge in respect of shares that are subject to the risk of forfeiture at the point when the risk of forfeiture is lifted or when the shares are sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 149B of the 1992 Act ensures that when shares that are subject to forfeiture are sold, the acquisition cost for capital gains tax purposes is the amount paid for those shares. If the section were deleted, the acquisition cost would be the market value of the shares when they were acquired. There is also a deduction under the same Act for any amount charged to income tax under section 140A of the Taxes Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two provisions together ensure that the employee is charged capital gains tax on the correct amount, that is to say, his or her actual gain on the sale of the shares, but with an allowance for any gain charged to income tax, to prevent a double charge. If section 149B were removed, as the amendment proposes, in many cases the employees would pay capital gains tax on considerably less than that amount. There is no justification for that special treatment, which would be unfair to other taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a technical provision, which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) who is an accountant, will have followed in great detail, although it may not arouse the same fascination in other members of the Committee. However, I hope that in the light of my explanation he will seek leave to withdraw the amendment. If he does not, I shall urge my hon. Friends to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 107, in page 20, line 19, leave out from 'section' to end of line 20 and insert 	<br><blockquote><p>'shall be deemed to have effect from 17 March 1998'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause seeks to remedy some of the design faults in last year's Finance Bill that would have led to a double charge for tax in some instances. Similarly, clause 40 seeks to introduce an exclusion to the conditional shares provision when an employee leaves a company compulsorily, because of misconduct. Both clauses state that the proposals would be effective from the time that this Bill becomes law, but surely, as the measures remedy a defect in the law passed last year, they should be effective from the date when that law became effective, namely, 17 March 1998. The amendments would change the effective date to 17 March 1998. That is the view not
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>
only of the Opposition but also of the Institutes of Chartered Accountants and the Chartered Institute of Taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society takes a different view. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Given that the amendments … are designed to smooth difficulties to which the 1998 rules as drafted give rise, we would suggest that equivalent relaxations should be applied in cases where cases have inadvertently fallen foul of the 1998 rules in the period between the 1998 Budget and Royal Assent"—</p></blockquote>
of the Bill. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment, but if she cannot, I ask her to make a statement for the record, which will help in respect of Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart, effectively applying the measures extra-statutorily, so that no one suffers by falling within the period to which the old rules apply but the Bill does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said in the previous debate, clause 39 prevents a double charge to tax arising in relation to the acquisition of shares subject to forfeiture. Amendment No. 107 makes the change retrospective to last year. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton invited me to accept the amendment. I have to disappoint him on that point, but I can give him the reassurance that he seeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, the circumstances under which a double charge might arise are comparatively rare, because it would require somebody to have taken an option on shares that were subject to forfeiture. However, if those circumstances arose, the Revenue would not, in practice, seek to collect the double charge. Therefore amendment No. 107 would introduce the complexities of retrospection into the Bill for no practical purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 108, which you have properly grouped with amendment No. 107, Mr. Butterfill, would apply retrospection to clause 40. Clause 40 adds two new cases to the categories of shares that are specifically excluded from the special tax rules introduced in last year's Finance Act. The excluded cases are, instead, taxed in line with general tax rules. Amendment No. 108, like amendment No. 107 in relation to clause 39, would make the change retrospective to last year, but would have a more mixed and less happy effect. Amendment No. 108 would change the tax treatment of employees who have already received shares in the expectation that they would be subject to the special tax rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>365</span>
In a number of instances the employee may be better off being taxed in line with the general tax rules, but that is not always the case. As we all know, the value of shares can go down as well as up. Furthermore, as a result of the amendment, employees who subsequently forfeited their shares, having paid tax on their acquisition, would find themselves stuck with a tax bill but no shares, and would have no right to reclaim the tax, although they had forfeited the shares on whose acquisition the tax charge had arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I recall from an earlier debate about vehicle excise duty on lorries, Opposition Members are extremely worried about the retrospective application of Finance Bill clauses, and I am surprised that in this case the hon. Gentleman seeks to apply retrospection to clauses 39 and 40. I hope that I have been able to reassure him, in the case of clause 39, that were a situation to arise in which a double charge to tax might apply, the Inland Revenue would not collect it. I hope that I have also been able to persuade him, in relation to clause 40, that it would be wrong to present an unexpected retrospective tax bill to some employees, as amendment No. 108 would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will therefore feel able to withdraw the amendment. If not, I must ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary's answer was full, frank and helpful. It shows how important it is to get such measures right in the first place. It is a pity that the Government did not bring forward a set of watertight anti-avoidance clauses last year. People outside the House will find her statement on amendment No. 107 useful, although I emphasise again that it would be better if all such provisions were in one place in the legislation, rather than taxpayers having to rely on reading 	<i>Hansard</i> to fill out all the details. In view of that helpful statement, and the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problems that the clause is meant to alleviate are those of private companies that are not quoted on the stock exchange, and have quite strict conditions in their articles of association about who can hold shares in them. The Government have made a limited attempt to deal with those concerns by taking out measures designed to deal with what are called "bad leavers". But that still leaves difficulties in place for other leavers. They will be forced to forfeit their shares, and the fear is that they will then fall foul of the anti-avoidance provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to deal with the problem by applying the exemption not only to those who are leaving
	<br><blockquote><p>"as a result of misconduct"</p></blockquote>
but to those leaving for any other reason. Amendment No. 154 would remove that phrase so that the exemption would simply read: 	<br><blockquote><p>"if he ceases to be an officer or employee of the company".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 155 would add other reasons for leaving, such as
	<br><blockquote><p>"death, retirement, redundancy, injury or resignation".</p></blockquote>
If the Government accepted either amendment— clearly they cannot accept both—it would make it much easier for private companies to offer shares to employees as part of an incentive arrangement, which I understood was the Government's intention. They wanted to get companies without liquid market in their shares to try to offer those shares to employees. Either amendment would make that much simpler.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can once again persuade the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment. We are making wonderful progress here. As he said, both amendments seek to exclude all the circumstances in which employees receive shares that can be forfeited only if they leave that company, from the special tax rules for shares subject to forfeiture that were introduced in last year's Finance Act. As the clause stands, it excludes only the case of employees who will forfeit the shares if they leave the company because of misconduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point to make is that the special rules that we introduced last year for the taxation of shares subject to forfeiture are not in any way penal. On the contrary, they ensure that employees are taxed on a fair and sensible basis, and pre-empt possible avoidance schemes involving shares whose value is artificially depressed by a risk of forfeiture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where an employee receives shares that can be forfeit only if that person is sacked for misconduct, the effect on the value of the shares is negligible. Where, however, the shares can be lost if the employee leaves the company for any reason, the value of the shares can be significantly depressed. That is why the clause is worded as it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>367</span>
The result of amendments Nos 154 and 155 would be that many employees would receive a tax bill earlier than they would under the special tax rules, and in some cases would have to pay tax on shares that they might not ultimately own. Conversely, the amendments would also allow tax avoidance schemes to be set up whereby employers pass value to their employees without paying enough tax. That would stem from the possible artificial depression of the value of the shares that could result if they were subject to forfeiture when the employee left for any reason, and would clearly be unfair to other taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My main point was not how penal the anti-avoidance measures were.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 153, in page 21, line 36, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) If under this section there is no charge to tax under section 154 (or would be no charge if the employee were in employment to which this Chapter applies) there is no charge to tax under section 141 (non-cash vouchers) in respect of a voucher evidencing the employee's entitlement to use mobile telephones requiring pre-paid vouchers.'.</p></blockquote>
The clause is welcome because it attempts to simplify the law. Mobile phones are no longer the luxury goods that they once were. As they become a more integral, indeed essential, tool of business rather than merely an annoyance in restaurants, it makes more sense to remove the relevant provisions from the taxable benefit rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the clause's drafting, several issues require clarification. The amendment would deal with one specific area of uncertainty, regarding mobile phones that require pre-paid vouchers. Does the supply of such vouchers constitute a taxable benefit for employees to whom they are supplied by employers? Will the Economic Secretary give a definite response to that question? The amendment would make it clear that it would not, but any statement from the Economic Secretary would be appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also unclear whether the exemption in the clause applies to all phone charges—for example, personal non-business calls made by the employee.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman needs to realise that technology changes. When the tax was introduced, mobile phones were a luxury product, available to only a few people. They were often a perk of employment, so it was right at that stage to tax the benefit as a perquisite. Mobile phones are now part of everyday life. There are several in this Room—although I hope that they are switched off. Now that they are part of everyday business life, it is no longer necessary to regard them as a taxable benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Economic Secretary answer a final question about the wording of the clause? Why has she excluded from the exemption cases in which an employer reimburses employees for all the costs of owning and operating their own mobile phones? That is almost the same as having the phone supplied directly, so it is odd that the exemption should not apply to such cases. Are there any specific reasons why it does not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healey) has reminded us of the one joke that the then Chancellor told when he introduced the tax on mobile phones. It is a tax that Conservative Members now regret. I recall another famous joke about mobile phones and the impact of the incredibly rapid changes in technology that have made them smaller and smaller: for the first time ever, we see groups of men standing around boasting about who has got the smallest. I hope that that joke will not be thought inappropriate for a Finance Bill Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will accept—I think that he did—the great benefit of clause 41 for both employers and employees. I am not sure that he has had to do the form-filling, or to draw up the list of private and business calls that has been required in every tax year to meet the conditions of the tax on mobile phones introduced by the previous Government. It has proved to be one of the most unwelcome and complicated aspects of employees' benefits tax legislation that employers have had to operate. That is why we have decided to abolish it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>369</span>
We shall abolish the tax completely. When an employer provides a mobile phone for the use of an employee, no charge to income tax or to national insurance contributions will arise. It will be necessary for the employer—unless he chooses to do so—to require the employee to keep records or to analyse the bills of the telephone company to ascertain which calls have been made for business and which for private purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would extend the thorough exemption that the clause introduces, to cover the employer's provision of pre-paid vouchers to an employee to allow him to make a limited number of calls using a phone that belongs to someone other than the employer. Vouchers that provide benefits and cash are taxable under separate rules set out in section 141 of the Taxes Act 1988. It is not necessary to extend the exemption provided in clause 41 to cover vouchers, nor to allow employers to reimburse employees' mobile phone expenses with tax-free cash payments. These days, employers should find it simple to ensure that employees come within the wide terms of the relief that they provide, if that is what they want, simply by subscribing for mobile phones used by their employees, and meeting the cost in the usual way. I ask my hon. Friends to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady's answer was helpful in that she made it clear that personal phone calls will not be regarded as a taxable benefit. But it is a pity that she did not accept the amendment, because tax legislation will in future be biased against certain types of telephone provision, which will make it difficult for employers to provide certain types of phones for employees. However, given the Economic Secretary's full and frank response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The objectives of clause 42 must have seemed laudable to the Chancellor of the Exchequer as an effort, based on the Swedish experience, to spread the use of computers. However, the part of the clause
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
to which my amendment relates contains what appears to be an unnecessary restriction on the way in which tax exemption for employees will operate. Clause 42(2) would ensure a uniformity of application of the proposal. All employees would be treated equally. No one employee—a director for example—could get a better deal than would be available to employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute of Directors said in its representations to us that the subsection could deny the exemption to a company if anyone could identify a director and a non-director and say that the director was favoured over the other employee. It said that the consequence would be that all employees would have to be treated as favourably as the most favourably treated director. It qualified that observation with the following words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"More generally, it is not appropriate to deny the tax exemption where only directors and senior staff receive equipment. Employers must be allowed to limit equipment to the staff who will make the best use of it, and they may happen to be the senior staff. We appreciate that the point of the tax exemption is to encourage the development of skills as well as the business use of computers, but employers are not charities. They cannot be expected to supply computers to staff who will not make a significant business use of them."</p></blockquote>
I tabled the amendment because subsection (2)(a) and (b) of proposed new section 156A of the Taxes Act 1988 appear unnecessarily restrictive in the way that they allow the tax concession. One can perceive the difficulty for say, a micro-company with perhaps one director and two or three employees, in which, for good technical reasons, there is a need for the director to have a more powerful—and therefore more expensive—computer than could be made available to others on a loan basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Limitations on a company might prevent it from raising the standard, and cost, of computer equipment to the level needed by the director. If a company cannot upgrade everyone to the same higher, more expensive level, the relief will be denied to the appropriate employees. There are distinct advantages in making such equipment available; it encourages the use of computers, especially at home. Proposed new subsections (2)(a) and (2)(b) will knock out that possibility in companies that might want to encourage the general availability of computer equipment on a loan basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove an unnecessary restriction. If the Government want to encourage companies to make computer equipment and the associated software available to employees on a loan basis, they should allow companies to make whatever distinctions are consistent with the running of the business, and let the clause's limitations and the tax restrictions take care of any monetary differences that may result from the fact that—perhaps for exceedingly good business reasons—different types of equipment are made available to different classes of employee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 42, too, is welcome, but I am not sure why the Government consider it necessary. It would be absurd to levy an income tax charge on employees who take home their portable computers and may happen to play a game of solitaire or write a personal letter on them. That would be as absurd as charging an employee a taxable benefit for personal phone calls made at work, or for the central heating bill savings that an employee makes because he is in the warm office at work rather than at home. The Government have not advanced provisions to tackle those perks at work, so why does the Bill contain provisions covering computers that are taken home?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled a question to the Chancellor asking him to estimate the number of employees being charged income tax on any taxable benefit arising from the provision of computer equipment by an employer during the past two years. In her reply, the Economic Secretary said that she regretted that the information requested was not available. If no information is available, one wonders what prompted the Government to propose the change in the law. I ask that not simply because I suspect that the Chancellor simply wanted an excuse to talk in his Budget speech about having computers in every home— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, my hon. Friends say that it was another gimmick. The Government's proposals may trigger a benefit charge that, in practice, did not arise previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal also gives a neon light to tax planners to find benefits that comply with the clause's provisions and enable employers to give employees some tax-free benefits. Difficulties arise in relation to the cost limitation implied in the Bill, especially subsection (2)(b) of proposed new section 156A, which states that if a director is given a computer of a higher value and specification than the computers given to other employees, the computers given to everyone in the firm would become taxable benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the concern of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are concerned at the restrictive nature of new section 156A(2). Whilst we can see why preferential treatment for directors should exclude the director concerned from relief, we are unclear why such provision should impose a benefit charge on all the rest of the employees."</p></blockquote>
If an employee's use of a computer at home involves 75 per cent, business use and 25 per cent, private use, will the value of the computer, for the purposes of the new section, be the whole value of the computer or just 25 per cent? For example, would a £10,000 computer fall within the scope of the provisions, so that the benefit would be exempt?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the concern of the Confederation of British Industry, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would welcome confirmation that where there is mixed business and private usage it is only the private use element that will be counted. Thus, if a computer and peripherals cost £5,000 and 75 per cent, usage is business, there is no benefit in kind
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
taxable because the value of the private element is less than £2,000."</p></blockquote>
That is also the concern of the Institute of Directors, which states that new section 156A(2)(b), the subject of the amendment,
	<br><blockquote><p>"is likely to be too restrictive. It could operate to deny the exemption if one could identify any one director and any one non-director, such that the director was favoured over the non-director. The consequence would be that all employees would have to be treated as favourably as the most favourably treated director."</p></blockquote>
The IOD is also worried about new section 156A(5)(a), stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Suppose that a computer plus its general software cost £2,000, so that the exemption given by section 156A would cover the taxable benefit that would otherwise arise, but the computer also contains specialised business software that cost an additional £3,000. That specialised software is only used for business purposes. Would the Inland Revenue accept that the computer plus all of its software could be separated into two elements: the £2,000 worth that is covered by the exemption and the £3,000 worth"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the well known fears and anxieties of many Opposition Members in the face of the introduction of new technology, will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee whether he thinks that getting a computer into every home is a good policy objective, and whether it can and should be pursued through the tax system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am dripping with technology, myself. The hon. Gentleman should realise that technology is moving very fast, and it will soon be difficult to distinguish between all the pieces of equipment. Such technology may soon be in every home, because every home has a television set. The hon. Gentleman must not get too Luddite in his approach to technology, and he must keep up to speed with what is going on in the real world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a computer being used at home has a quantitiy of expensive software—£3,000 or £5,000 worth, for example—that is soley for business use, will that value be taken into account by the Inland Revenue when assessing the value of that computer for the purposes of assessing a taxable benefit? On that point, I will rest my case and wait to hear the Economic Secretary's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not take offence at this, but listening to him makes me understand why I never wanted to become an accountant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of clause 42 is straightforward. It is to exempt from tax the first £500 of the annual benefit provided to an employee when an employer lends or provides at low cost a computer to that employee for use at home. At present, the provision of computer equipment for use by an employee at home would be wholly chargeable to tax. As the right hon. Member for Fylde said in moving his amendment, a similar tax exemption introduced in Sweden resulted in a dramatic increase in loans of employer-owned computers to employee households.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the provision in clause 42 will have similar effect in this country. We want to ensure that the tax relief provided by clause 42 will not be used by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>373</span>
directors of a company, who would almost certainly determine whether and on what terms computer equipment was made available to employees for home use, to introduce arrangements that deliberately advantage themselves to the disadvantage of other employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, it would be unreasonable to require employers to provide computers of equal value or otherwise to all employees in order to claim the benefits of the exemption. Employers will have to judge how best to allocate computer equipment to employees by reference to the financial resources of the company, business need and the existing computer skills of employees, who would include directors. If the proper criteria were applied and the directors of the company happened to be the least computer-literate in the work force—I hope that that would not be the case—and if one of those criteria were the need of staff to get up to speed with computers, the computers would be lent to the directors. That would be the proper result. We merely want to exclude arrangements designed to privilege directors over employees. The clause would not have the effect that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and some outside organisations are worried about— that to qualify for the tax relief, a company would have to provide every one of its employees, including directors, with equipment of precisely the same value. That is not the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful piece of analysis, but will the Economic Secretary be a little clearer about how the test of whether directors were being favoured would be assessed? If there is no necessity for everyone in the company to have the same computer equipment, how will a judgment be made on whether a director is advantaging himself?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A company that made an arrangement whereby only directors were given employer-owned computer equipment to use at home would not qualify for the relief. A company would also not qualify if it gave directors privileged terms—for instance, if they were given computers to use at home free of charge, while other employees had to pay a contribution towards them. If an employer determined the availability of computers for home use according to the computer literacy of the individuals concerned— and the least skilled were given the first call—that would be a proper arrangement, even if the computer-illiterate directors were to have the first call on the available equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements that a company puts in place are what is significant. The exemption under the clause will not be given if the equipment or the arrangements are confined to directors or made available to them on privileged terms, because, clearly, that would be unfair. Directors usually control the allocation of resources and equipment in a company. They should not be able to take advantage of a tax exemption that is designed to spread computer literacy and the use of
	<span class='label label-info column'>374</span>
computer equipment and restrict the benefit of those arrangements to directors as such. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the restrictions on privileged use or use confined to directors only were replaced with the tax relief purpose test that the hon. Gentleman proposes in his amendment, the system would be more difficult to operate. We would have to examine the intention behind the arrangements, and that would be less clear than the arrangements that we are putting in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 151, I have dealt with most of the points raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, but I draw his attention to the fact, which is clarified in the explanatory notes, that even under existing tax law, equipment and software used purely for business purposes, including equipment used at home and elsewhere, is already exempt from tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the purpose of the clause is clear and I hope that the Committee is reassured that we are trying to exclude from the exemption in the clause only unfair arrangements that wrongly privilege directors over other employees. The clause will not have the deleterious effects feared by chartered accountants. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment, but if not, I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little concerned that the Economic Secretary confined her case studies to people brushing up their computer skills. She shows lack of understanding of the use of portable computer equipment in the sort of small business that I outlined in my comments in support of the amendment. There may be companies with only two directors and a limited number of employees, and there may be good business reasons for computer equipment to be lent to those directors by the company, which, as a legal entity, owns the computer equipment. The directors are also employees of the company, and a loan approved is the right way to confer on them the ability to take that equipment home, because they may wish to conduct their business affairs there. I know many business people for whom the portable computer is part of the portable office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a small company with only a few employees cannot make portable equipment available, that is not a reason for restricting the relief. It seems to go against the thesis of helping small start-up companies, and it is disappointing, that the Economic Secretary has not seen fit to concentrate on that. Her entire perspective is based on the concept that the facility will be used only by people who want to take the equipment home to learn or brush up their skills. It is more likely that the equipment will be used for serious business purposes within the home or at other locations away from the workplace. It is sad that she did not acknowledge that argument, because the provision poses unnecessary restrictions on how companies operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>375</span>
The Economic Secretary also identified a minefield of complexities connected with the motive test which the Revenue will no doubt apply to determine whether the reliefs are appropriate. Companies will waste a great deal of time trying to clarify, in discussions with the Inland Revenue, where they stand. Will the Inland Revenue produce one of its helpful little booklets to help businesses to get through this minefield of complexity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I have had a naughty and slightly malicious thought. Have the Ministers or their officials had any contact with representatives of the computer or software industries about the implications of the clause? Some companies could gain a distinct commercial advantage from the extension of the facility. I want to understand why the Government have introduced the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend put his finger on the issue. The Economic Secretary's answer confirmed that. This measure, which should not be complex, has created a vast amount of complexity. It would help outside bodies if she would answer my questions. Will a computer that costs £5,000, and 75 per cent. of its usage is business and 25 per cent. is private, fall within the exemption? Given that it costs £5,000 and there is some private use of it, will that take it above the £2,500 limit of the exemption? Similarly, if a computer has £3,000 of software that is used solely for business purposes, would that £3,000 not be included as part of the value for the purposes of the provisions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try again, although Opposition Members are making heavy weather of this. I suppose that having got three clauses through with all the amendments withdrawn, the honeymoon had to end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me stress that the new tax relief provided in the clause is additional. It does not weaken exiting provisions of the tax regime. Computer equipment and software that is provided for business use by an employee at home is already exempt. When we discussed mobile telephones, I gave the example of the appalling bureaucracy that millions of people have to endure and which I experienced as an employee. A mobile phone was provided for use when I was travelling, which had to be accounted for by my company. A portable computer was also provided by the firm for my use in the office, at home or anywhere else. As business equipment, it was not chargeable to tax, and that remains the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked whether a tax charge would apply to expensive software equipment installed and available solely for business use. If it is supplied solely and necessarily for business purposes, it can be exempt under existing law, as the hon. Gentleman knows, given his expertise in tax law. The new relief does not affect that. It will be a question of fact in every case. Whether the conditions of the exemption are met will be determined by reference to individual circumstances. On the face of it, his example of expensive software that is provided solely and necessarily for business purposes would stand to be exempt under existing tax law. I hope that I have reassured him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>376</span>
The purpose of the new tax relief is to spread greater computer literacy. That was the effect of a similar relief in Sweden. However, in the case of equipment that is used privately as well as for business, it is clear from the Bill that any value in excess of £2,500 will remain taxable. I hope that my answers have reassured the hon. Gentleman and that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It remains to be seen how the measure will work in reality. In fairness, the Economic Secretary identified some technical deficiencies in the amendment, and it is important that we pass good tax law, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share none of the enthusiasm that has been expressed for the clause, nor do I share much of the sense of benign tolerance that I detect on the Opposition Front Bench. It would be hard to find a clause that is more redolent of old-fashioned micro-interventionism of the worst possible kind. Before the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Mr. Casale) jumps up and asks me whether that means that I am against the development of the wider use of information technology, I assure him that I am whole-heartedly in favour of the widespread use of new technology. I simply do not know where Committee members have been for the past few years if they seriously believe that we need a tax concession in order to promote the market for personal computers in the home. Sir Stanley Kalms, to name but one, has made himself and others a great deal of money by developing precisely that market. We are told that the Chancellor much admires the example of events in Sweden. This really is old times coming back! It is a long time since I have had the Swedish example held up to me as an object of admiration. Might not the Swedish Finance Minister be looking at the development of the use of personal computers in Sweden and in Britain and asking himself whether the tax concession that he launced in Sweden was actually a waste of money, given that exactly the same thing happened in Britain without a tax concession?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a typical example of the difficulties politicians get themselves into when they seek to launch themselves at the bandwagon of new technology. When politicians do that, they invariably learn about new technology second hand; they launch themselves at the bandwagon, but the bandwagon is already in the next county. That is exactly what has happened in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the Economic Secretary think represents computer equipment? I notice that the Bill does not define it. It assures us that the definition of computer equipment, whatever it may be, includes,
	<br><blockquote><p>"printers, scanners, modems, discs and other peripheral devices".</p></blockquote>
I am sure that it does, but if the Economic Secretary were as conversant with new technology as she claims to be, she would know that the phrase "computer equipment" covers a much wider range of potential
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>377</span>
uses than that. I have listened to compact discs on a personal computer. In may households, that is a normal use of computer equipment. Those involved in the industry regularly write articles about the disappearance of the distinction between the television and the personal computer. Every personal computer has a screen that can be used as a television. The Economic Secretary is introducing into tax law the principle that equipment such as compact disc players, televisions and telephone equipment—admittedly, one subsection makes a half-hearted attempt to eliminate telecommuncations equipment—is definable as computer equipment. Employers who are looking for an alternative to the company car as a tax-efficient way of remunerating their employees will find that the Economic Secretary has opened a socking great gap, which will enable them to find that alternative without giving the tax man his due.

I understand why the Liberal Democrats chose not to move their amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Casale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment. The Liberal Democrats said that the proposed tax loophole should be doubled in size. That would be not a tax loophole but a tax chasm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promised to give way to the hon. Gentleman, but I would have only four minutes in which to develop my argument. I should be genuinely interested to hear how the Economic Secretary will guard against the exploitation of that loophole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I looked at the press release. The Committee may wish to remember that the estimated revenue cost of the proposed tax loophole is £5 million. If we assume that everyone will get £500 of taxable benefit, the revenue cost at 23 per cent, will be about £115 a taxpayer. Of the total number of taxpayers—about 24 million—40,000 will benefit from the proposed loophole. I have a simple question for Economic Secretary. Why should not the other 23.96 million taxpayers participate in the bonanza that she is creating?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Love</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>378</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment. The Economic Secretary is confident that 23.96 million taxpayers are not interested in joining in her party, but if they did join in, the revenue cost would be £2.75 billion. Will she confirm that figure? Never knowingly undersold, the Liberal Democrats tabled an amendment, which they did not move with a potential revenue cost of £5.5 billion. There goes another penny on income tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that as a result of the provision £2.75 billion will go down the pan, but we have seen where that road leads. The same approach was adopted 20 years ago in respect of company cars, when we thought it was a good idea to promote the British motor industry and car usage. The argument was that company cars were more likely to be British-owned, and that there was a public interest in promoting company car use. Now we are busy clawing it back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir Stanley Kalms empire was built through entrepreneurial zeal. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde, the former Financial Secretary, hinted in his intervention, perhaps Sir Stanley's tax accountants are working out how his staff, and the staff of every employer in Britain—including, perhaps, the House of Commons Commission—might use that loophole to deliver tax-efficient remuneration to their staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that the provision is a £2.75 billion loophole, but I do suggest that to promote something that is in any case growing at a geometric rate is absurd, and is the worst kind of intervention. As my hon. Friends have argued, it puts an over-complex proposal into tax law. The Economic Secretary's answer to every charge that it is complex is, "Oh, no; it is not complex. Anyone who wants it will be able to benefit from it." Every time she said that, another million taxpayers were added to my mental calculation of the cost of her proposal to the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is to be a vote on the Floor of the House at seven o'clock, so I must finish now—but I hope that the Economic Secretary will take seriously the suggestion that the proposal is precisely the kind of tax planning opportunity that makes tax lawyers and zealous entrepreneurs rich.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
