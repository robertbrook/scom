<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span>: I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that there is a second financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room.</p>

SUPPLEMENTARY POWERS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed [8 July]:</i> No. 116, in page 10, line 33, leave out subsection (1).—[<i>Mrs. Spelman.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 48, in page 10, leave out line 38.</span></p>
<p>No. 49, in page 10, line 40, after 'Wales', insert 'in Scotland'.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment was proposed on Thursday, but I call the hon. Lady.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: She was on the second Martini.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The sun not yet being over the yard-arm, the real Martini must unfortunately elude us—for the good health of all members of the Committee<br><br>
I wish briefly to round off my opening remarks on this group of amendments. We seek to constrain the Food Standards Agency's wide-ranging powers. Even the explanatory notes describe those powers as being "very general", and it remains our primary concern that too much power could be conferred on the agency as a result.<br><br>
Since Thursday, however, I have established why Scotland is not listed in subsection (2)(d), which is the subject of amendment No. 49. The explanatory notes state that the procurator fiscal is the recognised authority for instituting criminal proceedings, and I thought that it would be better for me to correct myself than to have to suffer the humiliation of being told that the answer was to be found in the explanatory notes.<br><br>
The fact that the agency can institute criminal proceedings in all other parts of the United Kingdom could lead to a discrepancy in how proceedings are instituted, especially if a devolved authority was able to approach the matter separately. Again, we learn from the explanatory notes that that power is subject to other provisions in the Bill; that is the reason given for the wide-ranging powers allowed by clause 21(1), but a simple reading of the Bill does not make that perfectly clear. We seek to constrain the powers that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 252</span>
the clause could confer on the agency, so that there will be no confusion among those reading the legislation about whether the agency's powers could be abused in that way.<br><br>
That brings the remarks that I wanted to make on Thursday to an end, Mr. Hood. Thank you for giving me the chance to conclude.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am fast getting a reputation for being co-operative and tolerant when in the Chair. The amendment was proposed on Thursday, but I was pleased to allow the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) to say a few more words before asking the Minister to respond.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not comment on what the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) said about amendment No. 49. Since Thursday, she has read about the law in Scotland, and it is not the Committee's function to rewrite Scottish criminal law. I shall deal first with amendment No. 48, which would leave out subsection (2)(b).<br><br>
The agency needs to be able to give support to the activities of others, as it will work in co-operation with other organisations in various ways. For example, it will provide financial support for scientific and other research, collaborate with others in health promotion or food safety campaign and provide support in kind for publicity or educational activities such as materials for schools and leaflets for food safety week. That is the sort of assistance that we envisage being given under paragraph (b).<br><br>
It is wrong to suggest that clause 21 is a Martini clause. The hon. Lady was rather over-egging it. The agency will not be able to do whatever it wants, but it will be able to do anything that it needs to do in order to perform its functions as specified in the Bill. A massive constraint will be placed on the agency compared with what some hon. Members—not necessarily those in this Committee—have alleged. Some people have suggested that clause 21 empowers the agency to impose charges on food businesses. It does not.<br><br>
We do not accept that the clause gives the agency sweeping powers. It is a technical and legal provision that confirms that the agency can carry out its ancillary functions, such as renting property and paying for office cleaning. Such functions are not central but are necessary. Unless the agency can have its office cleaned, it will have difficulties, so it needs the power to make contracts. It cannot do whatever it likes, only what it needs to do to fulfil the Bill. That power is general. We have not tried to include a list of all necessary ancillary functions, but they must be related to the agency's main functions. It is not necessary to include such a list in the Bill. It is usual for other agencies to have such powers. The agency must be able to enter into contracts in order to carry out its research functions and operate as an organisation entirely separate from the day-to-day control of other Government Departments.<br><br>
I have been brief because we want to make progress, but I hope that I have made it clear that the clause is not the catch-all clause that people may have thought it to be. It must be read in conjunction with the agency's other powers in the rest of the Bill.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 253</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a wide power, probably more so than the Minister suggests. The industry is worried because the FSA itself will set the standards that it will subsequently audit and enforce. How will it be accountable, to ensure that it does not set unreasonable standards?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is the overall constraint. The agency must use proportionality and assess risk, as specified in clause 22 and its mission statement, which we shall reach later. It cannot constantly set what might be termed gold-plated standards over and above those considered necessary and proportional in carrying out its functions. It will be subject to judicial review, for a start. Moreover, the drafting of the Bill ensures that it will not go down that avenue. It will be constrained by its guiding principles. Provided that it operates within those principles, it should not cause the difficulties that the hon. Gentleman envisages.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have listened carefully to what the Minister has to say, but we feel strongly that the clause does not provide sufficient safeguards. To say that the agency may do anything to facilitate, or that is "conducive or incidental to", the exercise of its functions remains immensely subjective to the agency's view of carrying out its functions. Given that some of the safeguard measures with which we have tried to amend the Bill, such as an appeals procedure with an adjudicator in the event of a dispute, have been disallowed as amendments, we feel strong that it is important to register our protest at the extent of the powers that the unamended clause will grant to the agency, so we shall press the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 50, page 10, line 42, after "make" insert "reasonable".<br><br>
The Minister referred briefly to the question of charging when we debated the previous group of amendments. He rightly tried to explode the myth about the imposition of charges, but a provision to charge is clearly outlined in subsection (3), the only nuance of it being that such charges will be requested. We will discuss later the distinction between imposition and request.<br><br>
We feel that it is important to restrict the subsection by adding the word "reasonable", which would qualify the level of charging that the agency will be able to make. The explanatory notes seek to assure us that the charges will be made in accordance with the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 254</span>
Government's guidance on fees, but what assurance does that give us that the charging level will be reasonable? A straw poll of farmers' views about the scale of charges imposed on the livestock industry by the Meat Hygiene Service would show that farmers dispute the fact that such charges are reasonable.<br><br>
The industry has had little room for manoeuvre in terms of disputing or resisting the level of charging. That leads us to be concerned about how realistic it is to stand back and say that the charges will be made only when they have been requested. It is easy to see how businesses could feel unable to resist charges from the agency, because they might want to be seen to be good boys, to be compliant and to do all that they can to ensure that food standards are as high as possible. There is a certain ethos in which it becomes difficult to resist charges, even those that seem to be for requests. The safeguard that the charges will be for requests only is not perhaps as secure as might be thought.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
Subsection (3) must be seen in the light of the history attached to the agency. We were delighted at the Government's climbdown over the introduction of a flat-rate charge for the FSA regardless of the variable turnovers of the food premises or retail outlets that would have been subject to it. It was patently unfair that the same charge would have been levied on a small corner shop as on a large supermarket. Common sense has prevailed and the Government decided not to impose that food tax—a good decision—but we are anxious that it should not be possible to introduce any form of taxation via the back door under subsection (3).<br><br>
Charging for the facilities or services provided by the agency, supposedly at the request of the businesses that need them, will result in an additional cost on those businesses. It is not wrong in principle to charge for those services, but it is important that the scale of the charge should be constrained and that, as far as possible, it should be reasonable and proportionate to the service or facility provided.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me make it abundantly clear that clause 21 will not allow the FSA to impose charges on food businesses. Let us get that out of the way straight away. I do not care what Dr. North or Christopher Booker says, the clause contains no provisions for levying charges on food businesses. We are absolutely aware of what the clause means, and it does not mean back-door levies or charges. We must knock such ideas on the head straight away. It does not even cover the Meat Hygiene Service, the charges of which are provided for under section 45 of the Food Safety Act 1990.<br><br>
It is difficult to drum up an example because most of the information provided to the public will be free of charge, but if people request photocopies of large research documents, there will be a charge. The charge must be reasonable. We are not talking about charges being imposed on the food industry; the clause contains no such power. I intend to say that at least six times before I sit down.<br><br>
The normal Treasury guidelines, as referred to in the notes on clauses, must be followed for any charge
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0589">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 255</span>
levied for providing a service. If an agency is the only source of a regulatory activity or service—meat hygiene is a good example—it can recover up to, but not more than, the cost of providing the service and, generally, it must be transparent about those costs. The clause does not cover charges on the food industry. There is no back-door, hidden agenda. It is normal for most Government agencies to be provided with such a clause, so that they can charge for the information that they provide on request, or perhaps for consultancy services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the charges under subsection (3) be solely for the services provided, or will they include an element of cost recovery for the agency's overheads, including depreciation on fixed equipment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, the service will be requested and the charge will then be levied for the reasonable costs of providing that service. I cannot believe that the agency would be allowed to include a charge for its overheads in a fee levied for photocopying a lengthy research document, for example. It would be unreasonable for the costs of the agency to be added to the cost of the paper and of the staff who do the photocopying.<br><br>
The clause is narrow and I fully understand why the amendment was tabled; I do not criticise that in any way. We agree that the charges should be reasonable, but the nature of the charges covered by the clause are not the kind that we have had other debates about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Paice <span class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Cambridgeshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In an effort to save the Minister from more declarations of what the clause is not about, I put it to him that he has said that the Government accept that the charges must be reasonable—he himself used the word in his comments—and that all that we are suggesting is that the word should be included in the Bill. Accepting at face value the Minister's comments about the efficacy and scope of the clause, if a charge is simply to pay for photocopies or whatever, why can he not accept that "reasonable" should be inserted in the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because the charges would be governed by the usual Treasury rules on the collection of fees and charges, insertion of "reasonable" would cast doubt on those guidelines. As a former Minister, the hon. Member knows perfectly well that that is an honest answer to a reasonable question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We listened carefully to the Minister and we accept that he sees the point of our amendment. We do not intend to cast doubt over the Treasury's usual practice or in any way imply that practices elsewhere in Government might not be reasonable. Given that the Bill is qualified elsewhere with "reasonable"—in regard to making appointments, for example"—we thought it worth while to push that point. However, we accept that the charges will be reasonable if they are within normal Government guidelines. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin by welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Hood; this is the first time that I have served under your chairmanship in Committee. I am sorry that I was not in Committee last Thursday, when you were also in the Chair.<br><br>
On several occasions during our proceedings we have debated the agency's independence, not just in law but in terms of perception, and I am sure that we will do so several more times in Committee and on Report. If the agency is to be credible, it is essential that the food industry and consumers see that it is independent of Government interference. The amendments are designed to enhance that independence and to remove from the Bill aspects that we see as compromising to the agency's real and perceived independence.<br><br>
The clause states that the statement of general objectives and general practices must be submitted to the appropriate authorities, not out of courtesy but for their approval. The appropriate authorities may approve the draft submitted to them, with or without modifications, and the agency will then publish the approved statement
<br><blockquote><p>"in such manner as the appropriate authorities acting jointly may approve."</p></blockquote>
The clause makes it clear that the statement of objectives must receive ministerial or other agreement, and that Ministers can change the statement and determine at what level and in what way it should be published. That is wrong. The Government talk about the independence of the agency, but they seem to want to circumscribe that independence by vetting the agency's work.<br><br>
I shall not embarrass the Minister by referring to the reports on genetic modification. A ministerial committee sought to interfere in how they were presented to the public. The Government seem to want to keep handcuffs on the agency. If they do that, they will compromise the independence that we think is necessary, so we believe that those aspects of the clause should be removed.<br><br>
In retrospect, perhaps we should have tabled an amendment to require Parliament to approve the overall statement of objectives. It is clearly sensible that the statement should receive some overall approval, but there is a great difference between requiring Parliament to approve or disapprove the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0590">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 257</span>
statement as presented, and giving Ministers the opportunity to be involved at every stage in changing the statement without reference to Parliament. There is no reference in the clause to Parliament being required to scrutinise the statement of objectives. That is totally wrong.<br><br>
I feel strongly that we should consider more carefully what the level of potential Government interference will be. I have no doubt that the Minister will make light of what will happen and what the clause means, but whatever Ministers say, the clause means what it says, despite the fact that there is now a precedent to allow what Ministers say to be taken into account. What will carry the most status for the future is what is law, and that is what is included in the Bill.<br><br>
There is no doubt that the Bill gives wide powers to Government to interfere in the agency's work and there is no reference in the Bill to Parliament having the final say in approving the statement of objectives and general practices. I hope that the Government understand our objection to the clause and the purpose of the amendments. We want to enhance the agency's independence in reality, as well as its perceived independence among those with whom it will have contact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have already made several references during our proceedings to clause 22, which is an important clause. The first few words read, "The Agency shall prepare". The statement of general objectives and practices is the agency's mission statement. It gives effect to the guiding principles set out in the White Paper, which are littered throughout the Bill. The nine guiding principles set the parameters for how the agency will work. They also guarantee the agency's openness and commitment to consulting interested parties. Some of what should be included in the statement is set out in the Bill, and other objectives can be determined by the agency.<br><br>
We will have to take a step backwards, as legislators and as a Government, and let the agency get on with the job. The agency must provide the draft of a general statement of the principles of how it will work. It is true that there is nothing in the Bill about the agency consulting interested parties. I take it for granted that the agency will consult interested parties before any draft of a general statement of principles is provided to the appropriate authorities—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I suspect that I heard a mobile telephone ring. I remind hon. Members that it is out of order to have mobile phones in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Mr. Hood, and to the Minister. I was in the process of switching the phone off.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said, I take it for granted that the agency would consult interested parties before producing a draft for submission to the appropriate authorities—the Government and the devolved bodies.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 258</span>
The other fallback is that if the agency provides a draft to the Government and the devolved authorities, as required under subsection (4), and, for some reason, the Government do not accept all of the draft, everyone will know about it. That is because the agency has the power to publish its advice to Government and any information in its ownership. If the agency wants something in the draft that the Government do not want, or the Government insist on the inclusion of something that the agency does not want, that will be a matter of public record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point. The Minister has said that the agency's general powers to publish its advice—indeed, the requirement to publish its advice—would mean that any proposals for the general statement would be published regardless, and would be in the public eye. Subsection (6), however, clearly states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Agency shall publish the approved statement (including any modifications made under subsection (5)) in such manner as the appropriate authorities acting jointly may approve."</p></blockquote>
Is the Minister saying that that is secondary to the agency's overall obligation to publish its advice? If so, a conflict might exist between what the Minister says about that obligation and what subsection (6) says.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. Subsection (6) would not stop the agency publishing other information if it had had a dispute with the Government, or if it wanted to make it clear that it had been imposed on to include something in the statement that it had not proposed. If the agency were asked to publish the statement including modifications—as referred to in subsection (6)—and those modifications were ones that it did not want to include but was required to, the fact that it was being forced to do so would be in the public domain. Ministers would have to justify why they had demanded that the agency modify the draft statement. That is an important safeguard.<br><br>
Overall, the draft statement does not fetter the agency; it would be a mistake to regard it in that way. Giving the agency the the power to publish its advice to Ministers—and other information that it gathers or holds, including working papers—does not create a conflict. Information to be published would include the documentation that will have to be used to arrive at the statement of guiding principles, as required by the clause. That is not a problem. The agency will have to obtain approval for its guiding principles, and for the way in which it will work, from the appropriate authorities. There is no dispute about that. The way in which the agency and the Government go about that will be open and transparent. I assure the Committee that everyone will know whether there is any dispute about what is in or out of the statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to come back to that point, but also to consider subsection (4), which states that
<br><blockquote><p>"The statement shall be submitted in draft to the appropriate authorities for their approval before it is published."</p></blockquote>
The statement will be a confidential document at the stage at which it goes from the agency to the relevant authorities. It will not be until it is approved that it will be published in a way decided by the authorities. Taking the two subsections together, I cannot see
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0591">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 259</span>
when the Minister feels that the agency will be at liberty to publish the statement before approval, so that the general public and the House of Commons can see what is being proposed rather than what has been finally approved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not a lawyer, but there is nothing in subsection (4) to prevent the draft from being sent to the appropriate authorities in a public form. There is nothing to say that it must be kept secret or confidential.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why does it say "before it is published"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That means before the final document is published. The draft statement about the way in which the agency will work will be in the public domain, and I am certain that the agency will want to consult industry and other interested bodies when it drafts it. The issues will be known. Nothing in subsection (4) requires the draft to be kept secret before the appropriate authorities approve it. There is no point sending me a note about that as I shall not be contradicted on it. To require otherwise would go against the agency's ethos of working in a transparent and open way.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made a fair point, and I have given him a fair answer. When the agency is up and running, Ministers in the House and the devolved bodies will be responsible for making any changes in legislation for key policy decisions. There will be a chain of accountability, so it will not be unreasonable to have a say in the way in which the agency will set its objectives and practices. That is all that there will be; final approval, but in an open manner.<br><br>
We have discussed a point that the hon. Gentleman made outside an amendment. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health and I are but lowly cogs in the Government machine; we are not the business managers, the crème de la crème of the Government. However, I can say that I imagine that the agency's statement of objectives will have a high profile, given the nature and importance of the agency in terms of the Government's intention, Parliament's support and the fact that the agency was a strong manifesto commitment. I would be astonished if there were not a facility via the usual channels for a debate in the House to consider the document before it is given final approval.<br><br>
It would be outwith the spirit of the legislation to say, "We demand that there must be approval and a vote in the House beforehand." The Opposition have made no such demand. However, people will be interested in the subject, so Members who want to hold Ministers accountable for policy decisions based on guiding principles will legitimately be able to say, "If that is the way in which the chain of command and accountability goes, we want to voice our opinions before the statement is finally approved". There is no problem with that whatever.<br><br>
I cannot go any further than I have done to meet the spirit of the hon. Gentleman's speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the chain of command and responsibility, I believe that the Pesticides Safety Directorate and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 260</span>
are to remain independent executive agencies of MAFF. How will those agencies interact with the FSA? Will the FSA be responsible for legislation and enforcement?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The agency will have a veto on the regulation of veterinary medicines and pesticides. The Secretary of State for Health has charge of the Medicines Control Agency; veterinary medicines are dealt with separately. The agency will have assessors on the committees and be involved in the secretariat of the Advisory Committee on Pesticides and the Veterinary Products Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Cotswold was tempting the Minister away from the amendment. I ask the Minister to return to the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In short, the agency will have a veto on the approval of pesticides and veterinary medicines, as mentioned in the White Paper and other documents. In its statement of general principles, the agency could say how it intends to work with those continuing executive agencies that, unlike the Meat Hygiene Service, will not come under its wing. The statement will doubtless say how the agency should manage, audit and keep at arm's length the Meat Hygiene Service and the other agencies with which it will be required to work.<br><br>
I could go on for 20 more minutes, Mr. Hood, and stay in order, but, remembering what you said, I shall not do so. However, I can satisfy the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) that the agency will be very much involved, because it is part of the food chain. The statement of general principles will make it clear that there will be no no-go areas.<br><br>
In respect of amendment No. 138, I am absolutely certain that the agency will have discussions. We are not ordering it to, but, because of its nature, it will wish to have discussions with interested parties. The extensive consultation of the past two years, including the James report, the White Paper, the draft Bill, the Special Select Committee and the roadshow, was such that the ethos of openness and transparency should result in a consensus that will, I am sure, transfer to the agency.<br><br>
The amendments are not necessary, but what they seek to achieve will be fully taken on board by the agency. Ministers and the appropriate devolved authorities will be accountable. They are entitled to have a say, but no more than that because they are not initiating the draft document. The agency will write its own mission statement and present it to the appropriate authorities. I am sure that the difficulties envisaged by the hon. Gentleman will not arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Peter Brand <span class='memberconstituency'>(Isle of Wight)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we all agree that the agency should be independent, and that it should be under a duty to publish its findings. However, I am worried about taking the advice of the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) and setting up a body to protect the public, giving it an enormous amount of public money but then allowing the body itself to determine its objectives. Where is the accountability in those circumstances? We will not support amendments Nos. 51, 52 and 54, and we welcome the Minister's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0592">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 261</span>
statement that the draft objectives will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
I listened carefully to the Minister's comments on amendment No. 138, which we tabled. The spirit of what he said is written down clearly in subsection (2)(a). However, I have been consulted in my career in the health service for 30 years, and I know that there is a difference between being consulted and being ignored when recommendations are produced. If the agency wants the support of the various bodies with legitimate interests in its activities, it is important that they are involved in the draft. It is a matter of giving assurance to those who will put great effort into supporting the agency. We want the agency to be independent, not isolated. Therefore, to give the consultations credibility, it is important that at least the consultees have sight of the draft report before it is published, when it is open to influence. That is why I support amendment No. 138.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would expect the agency to be as genuinely consultative about the draft statement on principles as the Government have been about the Bill. I shall not get into an argument about the levy, but no one can argue that our consultation was not genuine. People did not believe it when we said that it was a draft Bill, that we were consulting and that we would listen. As a result of that consultation, we have changed the Bill in terms not only of the flat-rate levy, but of other matters.<br><br>
We want to find the solution to a problem, not to push through measures about which people have considerable doubts. We have been genuine. I should like the agency, the chair and the deputy chair, who will be appointed in due course—I am sure that the interested parties will read <i>Hansard</i>—to take on board the spirit in which the Government have introduced the Bill, the guiding principles and the draft statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have heard an absolutely typical expression of what the Liberals do all over the country: they go around, stirring up people because no one took notice of their consultation. The simple fact is that the views of those consulted do not necessarily have to be taken. The attitude of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) is that consultation cannot possibly have been done properly if someone has not taken on board his views and changed accordingly. That is simply impossible. Any organisation, Government or other authority that consults knows full well that it must listen to the views expressed, but that it does not necessarily have to abide by the responses, which often conflict.<br><br>
Although the Minister said that he would not be contradicted, I am afraid that I shall try to contradict him. In many ways, he has made the problem worse, because he clearly stated that there was no reason why the statement produced under subsection (4) should not be open to the public, but that the draft would not be published. He fails to understand that the word, "publish" does not necessarily refer to the final
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 262</span>
document. Publishing means putting a document into the public domain. A document is in the public domain once it is published, unless it is leaked.<br><br>
By saying that the draft should be in the public domain, the Minister is effectively saying that it should be published. Subsection (4) clearly states that the statement should be submitted in draft "before it is published". I contend that the phrase, "before it is published" clearly belies what the Minister has said. As the Minister says, the general ethos of the Bill is one of openness and transparency, so I fail to understand why it is necessary to include such phrases.<br><br>
If the draft is to be published, let it be published at the same time as it is submitted to Ministers. If Ministers decide, for whatever reason, to amend or modify the draft because of the consultation referred to in subsection (5), that, too, should be in the public domain. The inclusion of the caveats in subsection (4) about approving the statement "before it is published", and in subsection (6), referring to publishing
<br><blockquote><p>"in such manner as the appropriate authorities … approve", implies a degree of control.</p></blockquote>
When the hon. Member for Isle of Wight was trying to debunk our amendments, I said that perhaps there should be an amendment requiring Parliament to approve the final document. I still hold that view. The Committee and Report stages operate in such a way that if the Government were to concede our general point, we could come back on Report with a better set of amendments requiring Parliament to be involved in the process. I was not suggesting that there should be no control; of course, there should be democratic control, but there should be parliamentary approval for the final statement of objectives, rather than Ministers' approval without parliamentary involvement at any stage, other than possibly a debate, as suggested by the Minister. Ministers will be influencing those objectives and, therefore, circumscribing what the agency does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with every word that the hon. Gentleman says about accountability, but unfortunately, his amendments do not say that. Will he table a new set of amendments, so that the amendments can say what he means?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had just said that, if the Government were to concede the general principle of what we are trying to establish, our objective could be achieved by tabling further amendments on Report. I know that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight has been in the House for only a couple of years, but that is often how things are done in Committee. He knows that the Opposition do not have access to all the clever lawyers and parliamentary draftsmen who drafted the Bill in the first place, and an amendment may not always be technically right in its drafting. As I said, I have sat where the Minister is now sitting, and I have had to reject amendments because they were technically unsuitable to be included in the Bill. That is different from the general objective of amendments.<br><br>
The Minister has not convinced me. By requiring the authorities to be involved, rather than automatically publishing the draft statement, will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0593">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 263</span>
mean that the statement of objectives will be circumscribed. The Minister says that he wishes the public to know what is being produced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may have explained the point about publication less than adequately. Subsection (6) refers to the approved statement, but subsection (4) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The statement shall be submitted in draft".</p></blockquote>
It is perfectly possible for the statement to be printed up with the words, "draft statement", which can later be approved by the appropriate authorities. It will then be published as the approved statement. The two documents are separate, so there is no problem about the first one being in the public domain, which was the hon. Gentleman's central point on this group of amendments. Subsections (4) and (6) take on board his concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the Minister's response. Subsection (4) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The statement shall be submitted in draft to the appropriate authorities for their approval before it is published."</p></blockquote>
If the draft itself is published—draft documents are published regularly—there will be no need for the final words in subsection (4) because, as the Minister implied earlier, that requirement will be included in the overall obligation of the agency to publish. I contend that the clause is not acceptable as it stands. I interpret the wording of the provision as meaning that it does not require—indeed, it could be construed as meaning that it does not enable—publication until the statement has been approved.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 55, in page 12, line 2, after 'the', insert 'comparative'.<br><br>
Clause 23 requires the agency to consider several factors before exercising any of its powers. Our amendment concentrates on the requirement to consider
<br><blockquote><p>"the nature and magnitude of any risks to public health".</p></blockquote>
Adding the word "comparative" would strengthen the clause and enhance the agency's work.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
The purpose of introducing assessment of comparative risk to the agency's decision-making process is to enhance its credibility. In preparing to move the amendment, I looked hard at several Government decisions that have entailed risk. I read an interesting report that the interdepartmental liaison group on risk assessment produced on the use of risk assessment in Departments. Its author is the Health and Safety Executive, which commissioned a study in February 1997 to try to improve risk assessment in Departments. Several of its conclusions are relevant to our discussion.<br><br>
Although we now live longer and healthier lives than at any time in our history, we are more preoccupied than at any other time with risks to our health. That is a curious paradox of the advance of human progress.<br><br>
The HSE is quick to point out in its conclusions that communication about risk is critical—but that communicating risk is not always straightforward. Poor risk communication can have both emotional and monetary costs and we can think of examples where poor risk communication has led to great anxiety among the public about different types of food and substantial monetary costs to the industries producing food that is under the shadow of a health threat. The public need good, clear communication about comparative risk and I hope that that will be what the work of the agency is all about.<br><br>
At the time of the ban on beef on the bone, the then Minister of Agriculture, now the Minister for the Cabinet Office, made a statement describing the risk of contracting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from eating beef on the bone as "very small". The trouble with using such words in the public domain is that they are relatively meaningless unless they can be compared with other risks that we take on a daily basis. At the time, the <i>Evening Standard</i> made a stab at drawing up a comparative scale of risk and, using its own number-crunchers and the information available at the time, quantified the risk of contracting CJD from eating beef on the bone as 1.2 billion to 1.<br><br>
Such huge odds are difficult for members of the public to get their minds round; it is difficult to think on such a scale. To make it easier to comprehend what
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0594">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 265</span>
"very small" really meant, eating beef on the bone was compared with other risks, some of them extreme— such as the risk of being struck by a meteorite which is, according to the <i>Evening Standard,</i> 10,000 to 1, or of an air crash, which is 20,000 to 1. Even such low risks are more intelligible than the estimated quantifiable risk of contracting CJD from eating beef on the bone. Comparing it with the risk of dying from the nicotine consumption of smoking 10 cigarettes a day, for example, which is 1,200 to 1, makes it easier to understand what "very small" meant. Even the chance of being killed in a road accident is significantly less, at 10 million to 1, or dying from choking on the T-bone steak that one should not have been eating in the first place, which is 250,000 to 1.<br><br>
The newspaper was trying to produce a simplified Richter scale of risk. If such a thing could be created, it would help the public understanding of risk. In considering more closely how to help Departments with that risk assessment, the Government came close to establishing their own scale of risk, which they quantified at the bottom end as negligible risk and at the top end as unacceptable risk. The points in between were on a line of trying to achieve as low a risk as reasonably possible, the acronym for which is ALARP; specialists in risk assessment will know what I am talking about The general public are not privy to that scale, which is used in government to try to reach the right decision. Paragraph 58 on page 17 of the report states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Society's tolerance of risks is buttressed by an expectation that people will be told the nature and level of the risks, and confidence that the risks are being controlled as low as is reasonably practicable."</p></blockquote>
That is the principle on which life is lived, and it is quite right for the public to expect the Government to contain risk to an acceptable level, as far as possible. The problem is that, in the past, decisions that did not have public confidence have been taken because the risk seemed to be so small. For example, there was widespread public contempt for the ban of beef on the bone because the perceived risk was so small that it did not seem to warrant the Government's response.<br><br>
The Government document, "Modernising Government", which was published in March, says under the heading "What must change" on page 16 that the Government are often criticised for intervening too much to protect people from some risks while failing to protect them sufficiently from others. I suggest that the absence of transparent comparative risk assessment perpetuates the problem. That document pledges the Government to follow good practice in policy making as they assess, manage and communicate risk. Comparisons are a helpful guide to the consumer, who, properly informed, is better able to decide for him or herself. The purpose of a previous clause is to make available the information upon which the consumer can make a good informed choice, possibly without the guarantee of there being no risk at all—since trying to achieve no risk is the pursuit of Nirvana—but to enable the consumer to make a decision on the basis of clear information.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 266</span>
Consumers of food take risks all the time. A few simple examples illustrate the point. I have three small children, who are most particular about how an egg should be boiled. We have heard that the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) likes his eggs boiled for seven minutes—well over the recommended time—so that they are as hard as possible. The technical problem with that is that the egg is then no good for soldiers. For a small child, the egg must be sufficiently softly boiled for it to be possible to dip soldiers into it. As a well-informed and careful mother, I realise that, in preparing eggs in this way, I am entering into some form of comparative risk because salmonella can be passed on through a raw or partially cooked egg. I balance the risk and make my decision in the interests of peace around the breakfast table.<br><br>
Another example of a risk that is regularly entered into by the well-informed consumer is granny's favourite recipe for chocolate mousse, which requires raw egg. To cook the eggs would have a disastrous effect on the composition and texture of that recipe.<br><br>
Another kind of risk is that, at present the consumer's entire trust rests with the food outlet. The consumer of shellfish in a restaurant must trust the proprietor's judgment as to the freshness of the shellfish at the time of purchase. The very small risk of contracting shellfish poisoning is one that the consumer takes.<br><br>
My final point depends on the information available to the individual making the decision on the preparation of food, on the third party who is responsible for purchasing and cooking the food, and on the outlet that sells the food. A food consumer who visits a supermarket will often find that a number of items have been reduced because they are fast approaching their sell-by date. Such an item may be purchased and taken home, and may need to be stored in the fridge. The consumer takes on the whole risk of whether to use an item that is close to or even past its sell-by date by the time that it is taken out of the fridge.<br><br>
Those are examples of risks that the food consumer takes on a daily basis. A large part of the risk relates to the quality of information that is available. Opposition Members would contend that people do not need to be nannied; they merely need proper, accurate information. A comparative risk assessment would provide consumers with a good scale to inform their decision making.<br><br>
It is right to expect that the Government's decisions on food safety should be in proportion to the risk. Clearly, their decision on beef on the bone was not in proportion. The present provision of information and advice is riddled with inconsistencies—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Committee members should refrain from talking during an hon. Member's speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The agency must remove such inconsistencies. People are allowed to smoke as many cigarettes, eat as many roast potatoes or fried slices of bread—which are subsequently dripping in fat—as they like, but beef on the bone has been banned. People do not need to be told what to do unless the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0595">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 267</span>
Government assess that the risk has reached or is moving towards an unacceptable level, which would require the Government to protect the consumer.<br><br>
A risk assessment detailing every decision that the FSA proposes to make, on which the consumer's choice will depend, should be published. The consumer wants to know how safe a product is, whether it is chicken, cheese, a processed product or a combination of products. That would enable the consumer to make an informed choice. Constraining the clause with the word, "comparative", is the only way that the agency will be able to make a difference to the way in which the public perceive information on which they make their decisions. The history of poor provision of advice, and of decisions that appear to the general public to be disproportionate to the risk of the particular food product, can, therefore, be put behind us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Meriden. Her analysis contains much that is common between us. She spoke about the tensions and dilemmas that the Government face when trying to achieve the right balance of policy—between acting protectively or preemptively in order to protect the public health and making decisions that are rightly in the realm of private choice and private responsibility. If Government act too readily, they are charged with creating a nanny state; if they get it wrong by not acting, they are charged with negligence. In either case, the cost to human health can be great.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
There is between us a clear understanding of the complexity of public policy on the matter. It is an emerging science, although not even the best study of risk assessment, communication and management could give us the scientific certainty that would enable us to set aside the need to make judgments based on evidence. That is why the clause gives effect to the third guiding principle of the Food Standards Agency, one to which we expect it to make regular reference. I commend the documents to which the hon. Lady referred.<br><br>
I shall explain how the agency will be expected to act in its new and emerging public health functions. It will be expected to approach risk analysis scientifically. It will also be expected to recognise the complexity of risk analysis, which will involve it in assessing not only the quality and reliability of scientific evidence but the different risk to various groups—for instance, the disproportionate risk of salmonella to the elderly or young children would offset the personal risk assessment of whether to eat mayonnaise or soft-boiled eggs.<br><br>
A comparative approach to risk can have some value. A response to what is known to be a low risk will be different to a response to a high risk. However, risks from food can be quite different in nature and cannot be controlled mathematically. It is therefore important not to oversimplify the matter. Although I commend the excellent efforts of the <i>Evening Standard</i> to make the calculation and assessment of risk intelligible to its wide readership, we must also
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 268</span>
recognise that that approach has limits when it comes to the application of Government policy.<br><br>
We must find the critical boundary between defining when the Government should act—and when the public would expect them to act—in a protective way, and decisions that should be left to informed personal choice. I depart from the view of the hon. Member for Meriden on the value of the numerical calculation of the risk of transmission of new-variant CJD through eating beef on the bone.<br><br>
I supported 100 per cent, the decision to ban beef on the bone on public health grounds. We are operating a policy on the control of new-variant CJD, which seeks not only to minimise but to eliminate risk when there is evidence that risk may occur. The risk from beef on the bone was not from eating the meat, but from eating the potentially infected nervous tissue in the bone, against which the meat rested. The second risk arose from the possible transmission from eating soups, gravies or stocks that had been made with potentially contaminated bones.<br><br>
We hope that the ban is temporary. That is our clear aim, but given all the other steps that we are taking to close off every opportunity for new-variant CJD to become widespread in the human population, we had to take that protective action on the basis of the evidence that was available to us. When the assessment of risk changes in the light of the success of the measures taken to control the incidence of BSE, so, too, can the measures to prevent risk in the food chain similarly be lifted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say whether the Spongiform Encephalophathy Advisory Committee has advised that the risk of eating beef on the bone has reduced considerably? Is she suggesting that SEAC can say that it has been eliminated, or only that the magnitude of the risk has been significantly reduced? Unless the Minister is saying that SEAC has said there is no risk, which I venture to suggest no one could ever do, we are talking simply about the magnitude of the risk. That brings us all the way back to the issue of comparisons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, SEAC will consider the latest data on incidence. We are not aware of any known cause of BSE in the herd, apart from the potential for maternal transmission. SEAC will provide advice on the assessment of the latest figures. The main work has been done by Professor Anderson and colleagues at Oxford university. That advice will then be considered by the chief medical officer, who will then offer advice to Ministers. As soon as the key data is available, the chief medical officer will offer advice, and Ministers will make a judgment on that basis.<br><br>
With regard to the hon. Gentleman's point about how SEAC formulates its assessment of risk, that is a matter for SEAC to decide, as it sees fit in the light of the evidence that is presented by Professor Anderson and his colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Lady, but I do not think that her last remarks addressed my point. The mechanics of lifting the beef-on-the-bone ban are irrelevant; we merely used it as an example. She said from the start that it would be wrong to allow
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0596">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 269</span>
into the food chain food that could be a contamination risk. That is why she says that she supports the beef-on-the-bone ban, although it would be amazing were a Minister to say that he or she did not support it. Unless the day comes when she can contend with justification that there is no BSE risk from eating beef on the bone, the judgment, whether made by Ministers, SEAC or the chief medical officer, will be based on the magnitude of the comparative risk from doing so. That is why we contend in the amendment that that should be part of the FSA's responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the whole thrust of Government policy on the subject has sought to close any potential routes of transmission. As I suggested, the outstanding concern, when the beef ban was most recently reviewed, was in relation to maternal transmission.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman challenged me to say that a decision will be made at the point when there is no known risk, but I am reluctant to accept that challenge. The epidemiology of new-variant CJD is such that we learn all the time about its scope, scale and possible means of transmission. On the best available evidence, the only remaining transmission route in relation to the beef herd is maternal transmission. We calculate that that route will be closed 30 months—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thirty-nine months from August 1996.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That will be October this year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. At that point, we should be confident that that route has been closed. However, I would not want the Committee left with the false impression that we understand fully the nature of new-variant CJD, the degree of infectiveness, levels of exposure, likely incidence levels, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On issues of food safety, the Government proceed on the precautionary principle whereby all risks, however remote, must be considered. The clause covers the entire agency's work, which goes much wider than simply food safety. There is a fear that the agency will set excessively high standards in inspections of food processing organisations that could make them uneconomic compared to their competitors abroad. Does the right hon. Lady consider that in those circumstances the technique of BATNEEC—best available technology not entailing excessive costs—might be more appropriate for assessing risk in food processing plants?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Bill and the agency's guiding principles make clear, the agency has responsibility to approach the assessment of risk in a proportionate way. The clause takes account of those matters. I suspect that we shall have that debate in two or three years' time, when the scientific framework will be more sophisticated.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ian Gibson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are several scales of risk. There is the Richter scale that we hear about from the Opposition, measurable in terms of 1 in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 270</span>
20,000, 1 in 1 million and so on. Another scale, based on the public perception of risk, is not necessarily based on figures. For example, it is clear from the GMO debate that there is no risk to human health, and I would go along with that line, but no one—or perhaps one in 100 people—agrees with me. When making political decisions, one must weigh up the different scales of risk used in the different techniques; one is scientific, the other is based on public and media perceptions. It is a difficult path to tread and the question will be left open.<br><br>
The political decision made on beef on the bone was absolutely correct because the public perception was not based on 1 in 5 million, but on the scale of people's own perceptions, and of their control over the process. The public do not generally understand risk. They understand what chance a horse has at 10 to 1 as against one at 45 to 1, but they do not usually have such information about what to eat in a restaurant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention.<br><br>
The BATNEEC assessment of risk to which the hon. Member for Cotswold referred might be appropriate in some cases. That technique is usually used for environmental matters, but the principles are similar. The hon. Gentleman is no doubt aware of the consideration that the EU and the Codex Alimentarius Commission are giving to codifying the approach to risk and the application of precautions. Whenever the approach to risk is considered, so too is the importance of proportionality. It is extremely valuable that those two elements of assessment should be tied closely together.<br><br>
I draw the Committee's attention to the comparative risks mentioned in the White Paper "Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation", which was published last week. The White Paper sets out what I hope hon. Members will agree are a clear set of guiding principles on the management of risk. It states that the management of risk should be based on a high quality scientific assessment, that it should show consistency of approach and have a clear framework for intervention. If judged in retrospect—we know how important that is—it should have integrity and the capacity to protect the vulnerable. It should also offer a realistic sharing of uncertainty, and information about risk should provide insight. We want better ways to engage the public in making decisions on risk. Indeed, some of the tricky issues raised this morning will be resolved only if we succeed in achieving a balanced and informed public debate about where the responsibility lies for assessing and managing risk.<br><br>
Those broad principles lead to a set of clear steps, which form the template for a public-health approach to the management of risk, ensuring access to high-quality scientific and medical advice, communicating to the public, assessing risk at an early stage and making it clear that in cases of uncertainty we should talk much more about risk and whether food is safe than we do now. That matter, too, will involve further public education.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0597">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 271</span>
We also advocate giving advice about cases that cause public anxiety, because people do not know what risks they may face; identifying options for intervening to eliminate, reduce or control risk; selecting appropriate options in a way that involves the public and evaluates, using clear criteria, the appropriateness of intervention; and ensuring, through the application of science, that intervention is successful in controlling the risk for which it is intended.<br><br>
That describes the Government's developing approach to the management of risk in a field that involves considerable uncertainty. In the light of our full debate and full examination of the issue, I urge the hon. Member for Meriden to withdraw the amendment on the ground that it would add nothing more to the agency's responsibility in enacting one of its guiding principles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have listened carefully to the debate. It is important to take time over the clause, because it will be key to how the agency works. From listening to what the Minister had to say about it, I am not satisfied that the clause will not present a risk that the agency will make on behalf of the consumer too many decisions that are not based on a transparent, comparable assessment of risk.<br><br>
We strongly supported the provision in clause 7(2) that the agency's primary role should be to inform the public, so that consumers are well placed to make well-informed decisions about the food that they eat. I am not confident that the clause will not encourage the temptation to make decisions on consumers' behalf. The risk entailed may not be satisfactorily measured against the other risks that consumers regularly face.<br><br>
It was also important to take time to analyse the example of banning beef on the bone. The Minister's explanation led logically to the agency's deciding to lift such a restriction on the consumption of food only in the absence of further risk. However, it was clear from the epidemiology of the disease in both cattle and humans that, by removing a generation of the vectors of the disease, as was done with livestock over 30 months, the disease would eventually be eradicated from the national herd, and subsequently from the human population. That was largely predictable and constituted something very close to a no-risk scenario. In using that example, the Minister appeared to be saying that the comparatively small risk of contracting the disease through eating beef on the bone could not be quantified to the public with sufficient confidence on the part of the agency to allow the consumer to assess whether to take that risk in respect of the timescale of the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to interfere; my right hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health is dealing with this matter. However, I recall the meetings, and I laid the order before the House. A key added factor to the points made by my right hon. Friend, which were seductively reasonable, was that we did not know then, and we still do not know, the incubation period of new-variant CJD. It is an unknown quantity, and we do not know whether there will be an explosion of that disease within the human population. That is an added factor in the considerations that we debated in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 272</span>
Ministry before bringing the order to Parliament. Believe me, the decision was not taken on the simplistic ground of no risk or a small risk. There was a vast unknown, which remains the case today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty in the Government's handling of this unpleasant condition—it has spanned two Governments—is the scientific uncertainty that surrounds it. We are sympathetic to any Government who have to make such a decision when the science remains unclear. In future, the agency may still have to make decisions when the science is unclear. The Government's scientific advisers described the risk as very small and we remain convinced of the need to amend the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two important points here. SEAC provided three options. The then chief medical officer supported a ban on beef on the bone on public health grounds. To add to the uncertainty of my hon. Friend about the uncertainty on the length of incubation, there is also uncertainty about the degree of exposure that results in infection and the exposure that humans would have to face to contract or to begin to incubate new-variant CJD. Those are important other factors and the reason why the simple assessment of risk in numerical terms of new-variant CJD misrepresents the complexity of the judgments that have to be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that further expurgation. Of course we accept that such decisions are highly complex and cannot be based only on the numeric factor.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) made a relevant point, and it is the reason we remain convinced of the need for our amendment. He is right about the perception of risk, but comparison on the numerical side would help with that perception. The contrast that the hon. Gentleman made was between the numerical approach to the risk entailed in eating beef on the bone and the consumer's perceived risk of genetically modified foods. As far as I am aware, there has been no comparable effort to quantify the numeric risk, or at least not one that has reached the public consciousness. The perceived risk in relation to GM food is based more on an emotional and subjective response, without the numeric comparative approach that would be a more sensible approach to decision making on the risks of the different types of food involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Sally Keeble <span class='memberconstituency'>(Northampton, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am just concluding my remarks.<br><br>
We have had a lengthy discussion on the matter, but remain unconvinced that the clause should go through as it stands. We want to press our amendment to include the word "comparative".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Keeble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health or my Learned Friend the Minister of State may be able to say something further about the comparatives on risk. I should have thought that, before the previous Government licensed GM products for release in this country, they would have looked seriously at the health risks and would have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0598">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 273</span>
made decisions based on sound information. My understanding, and that of most people who have taken an interest in the GM debate, has been that the actual food safety risks to the public were negligible. Much of our consideration of that issue was based on the fact that it had been through an exhaustive process of licensing and was approved by the previous Government, who presumably considered the substantive, comparative and scientific figures.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew George <span class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 84, in page 12, line 5, after 'costs', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'(including any potential long-term cost to public health)'.</p></blockquote>
Notwithstanding our debate on the previous amendment, perhaps the Minister will reassure me by saying that the words we seek to include are already intended by the current wording of the clause. Although I believe that that would involve a verbal contortion, I shall wait to hear what the Minister says in reply.<br><br>
The need to take account of the long-term cost to public health arises from the stated main objective of the agency. In addition, we should recognise the importance of applying a precautionary approach, as was discovered in relation to the BSE crisis and genetically-modified food. We need to be more aware of the consequences of potential developments in the food chain, especially where the results may be irreversible. An inclusion of such a requirement in the Bill would not be novel, and it is recognised in environmental policy. Perhaps the Minister will either give the Committee an assurance that the Government intend to consider the long-term consequences or agree that the words proposed by the amendment are already intended by the current wording of the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can help the hon. Gentleman by saying that we certainly accept the spirit of the amendment. It is entirely right that in considering costs, the agency should take account of not only immediate costs to business but the cost to public health if it fails to take action. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the amendment is unnecessary. The potential long-term costs to public health are included in the definition of costs in terms of their nature, magnitude and uncertainty, as well as being risks to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 274</span>
public health as specified in subsection (2)(a). They are therefore already being considered. The amendment adds nothing to the clause, and risks casting doubt on the meaning of costs in the subsection. I hope that that reassurance will allow the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's reassurances and clarifications, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 128, in page 12, line 9, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(d) the probable impacts (including cost) upon small food processors, craft producers and small food retailers.'.</p></blockquote>
I want to discuss a matter that the Committee has not so far considered. As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire pointed out, we do not have the assistance of parliamentary draftsmen. The wording of the amendment may therefore be crude and even technically incorrect, but its purpose is to draw attention to the probable impact on small businesses of the agency's actions. That is a serious matter, especially in rural locations where there are many small-scale food producers, processors, craft producers and food retailers. Such businesses operate on a small scale and may be disproportionately affected by the agency's actions. I agree with the hon. Member for Meriden that this clause is key to the way in which the agency works, and its impact on small businesses would be significant.<br><br>
Hon. Members may believe that the welcome removal of the flat rate charge—irrespective of business size, as proposed in the White Paper—has nullified the need for an amendment of this nature. However, the agency's actions, as proposed in the Bill, could still have a wide-ranging and significant impact on small businesses. The detrimental impact that the Bill and the agency may have on small businesses might be ended, but that does not diminish the impact. Whether we believe in conspiracy theories or coincidences, many small food processors have expressed the view that large supermarkets and food processors would strongly favour aspects of the Bill that have a disproportionate impact on small businesses. Some small businesses have claimed that large businesses may be more supportive of the agency because they may gain a greater share of the market as a result. Small businesses may find it increasingly difficult to stay in the market because of the red tape and costs that the agency may impose.<br><br>
Attention has been drawn to the fact that the significant increase in notified food poisoning cases over the past 15 to 20 years has coincided with a decrease in the number of small businesses and processors. Whether that is an appropriate or inappropriate correlation is a matter for debate, but the Committee should consider it, and the Minister may want to comment. Yesterday, I spoke to a constituent who runs a successful fishmongers, called Quayside Fish, on the quayside of Porthleven. He started 25 ago years selling fish from the back of a car in his lock-up garage. In an article in <i>The Western</i>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0599">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 275</span>
<i>Morning News</i> on Friday 9 July, he referred to the early days of his business. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We used to just open the garage door, a pretty crude arrangement compared with what we have now, but at the time it was just what people wanted. You would never get away with it today."</p></blockquote>
My constituent does not suggest that that should necessarily be allowed today, but the question arises as to how people with only a little capital but with a great deal of enthusiasm can ever start a small business, given the investment required to establish a business in such an environment. He is pleased to have a good relationship with his district council environmental health officer, but he claims that much fear is created in the food industry, especially among small businesses. He meets the highest standards and has an excellent record, but he believes that the paperwork is produced in order to protect the inspectors. He is worried that those requirements will protect the agency and the environmental health officers, not necessarily the food producers and processors. My constituent says that a further burden of regulation could put impossible demands on small businesses. Of course, he is conscientious—he keeps cooked crab meat away from fresh products—and, like many small businesses, he has grown up in the premises from which he operates now. However, he understands the need for regulations.<br><br>
That example throws up a number of important points. My constituent, like all small businesses with fewer than 10 employees, needs extra help, not necessarily further regulation. He is not opposed to the regulations, but he needs assistance to meet them. For example, the environmental health officer recently told him that he needed to produce a hazard report. That is an understandable demand, but he is a busy man. He will have to find the time to produce a hazard report, uninterrupted and with little assistance, and he simply asks for some help. Through the amendment, we seek some recognition of the fact that the agency will have an impact on small businesses. Its impact is not made sufficiently explicit. We do not seek lower standards, but a recognition of the impact of the agency's actions and decisions on small businesses.<br><br>
I have spoken recently to a low-throughput abattoir in my constituency. It, too, asks only for help and flexibility—and some understanding of the difficulties that it faces—in meeting the new and improved regulations. They are not opposed to them, but they need help in drawing up the hazard report. The firm estimates that, with a staff of four and two occasional part-time employees, it will require one extra member of staff to prepare the report, because it will not have the time. In the medium-term, one part-timer will be required for the paperwork. That amounts to a 15 per cent, increase in the staff costs for that business alone. It may be said that increased costs are necessary to meet improved regulations, but those costs are disproportionately high for small businesses. The Minister should take that into account and the Bill should recognise the impact of the regulations on small businesses. On killing days, the low-throughput abattoir often has three inspectors watching two members of staff. There is a vet, watched by a principal vet, and a meat inspector.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 276</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What day of the week is killing day? In my experience, most small abattoirs insist on killing on Mondays, which is inefficient in terms of the use of the Meat Hygiene Service and the placement of inspectors. There is often a refusal to be more flexible, even though it would reduce costs.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot answer, though I understand that the killing day in St. Just is mainly Thursday, but occasionally other days. I will let the Minister know if I am incorrect, but I can assure him that this low-throughput abattoir operator is doing as much as she can to co-operate with the Meat Hygiene Service. She is not trying to be obstructive or difficult, but finds the burden of regulation and inspection disproportionate to the size of the business that she operates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the article by Christopher Booker on 21 February 1999, which mentioned inexperienced Spanish vets being employed among the 280 EU and other foreign nationals to enforce Brussels hygiene rules? Apparently, one of those vets stood for more than an hour watching Mr. Coles expertly dressing a bullock and then began clapping. "I applaud, I applaud", said the young man from Barcelona. Mr. Coles asked him why and the Spaniard replied, "Because I have never seen it done before."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not debating the Meat Hygiene Service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Hood, for pointing that out. I am aware that <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> columnist raised the issue and the Minister will doubtless comment on it if he feels that it is relevant to the impact on small businesses. I am not sure that it is.<br><br>
Low-throughput abattoirs meet high food hygiene standards and the highest animal welfare standards. Animals do not have to travel so far in order to get to the abattoir. If St. Just abattoir closed tomorrow, the nearest abattoir for the bulk of the livestock would be 30 to 40 miles away, which could have a detrimental impact on people visiting the area and on animal welfare standards.<br><br>
In fairness, the Minister has, after a recent ministerial statement, recognised the potential impact of new charging regimes by suspending the introduction of the charges under the additional costs of the specified risk material. That pinpoints the fact that the Minister, the Department of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are aware of the likely impact of the charges on small businesses.<br><br>
I appreciate that I am raising concerns rather than listing technical solutions to the problem, but I fear that solutions will not be found if the agency has no obligation to consider the impact of its actions and decisions. It could assist small businesses with the HACCP reports. It could seek to put a grant system in place to help small businesses meet the cost of new regulations. In many cases, the costs of new and capital investment are disproportionately high in relation to such businesses.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 277</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the great services that the agency could do for small producers is make the regulations crystal clear and limit them to small amounts of paperwork, so that producers simply have to tick a few boxes? That would make life a lot easier. The obscurity of the drafting of the current regulations is a problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my research in relation to the amendment, several small businesses commented on and complained about the complexity of the regulations, especially in relation to the need to prepare the hazard reports required of food processing operations, irrespective of size. The regulations may be relatively easy for larger organisations to comprehend and respond to, as they have dedicated staff who are used to dealing with the requirements and documents that Departments constantly produce. My hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight raises a significant point, which we can add to the list of actions that the agency could promise to undertake in order to respond to, and be cognisant of, its potential impact on small businesses. It could also take into account the impact of new charging regimes at some future date, as they may have a disproportionate impact on small businesses.<br><br>
The agency may result in a few large companies relatively quickly taking over the commercial activities of many thousands of small, often rural retailers and producers. If it does, this country will rapidly lose a great deal, and the Minister needs to recognise that. It would significantly harm regional distinctiveness and would have a detrimental impact on the many people who want to start new food producing businesses, who, as I have already said, would find it difficult to meet the enormous investment costs required. There would be a reduction in the variety of local cuisine and products available, which would lead to an increasingly sanitised and bland product range for consumers. That is not necessarily a consideration for the FSA, but consumers should be aware of it. It would result in a destruction of a rural way of life. In constituencies such as mine, and, undoubtedly, in those of many Committee members, there would be a reduction in the number of food producers, many of which add to the colour of life, not only in terms of their products but in the employment that they provide and their contribution to a rural way of life. It would also result in a massive loss of jobs in the countryside.<br><br>
The amendment would not lower or compromise standards. Its purpose is to take proper account of the impact of the agency's actions and decisions on small businesses and a rural way of life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mark Todd <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Derbyshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is unnecessary as, under clause 23(2)(b), the costs and benefits would be analysed in terms of society as a whole, the small business sector, and the Government. The micro level and the macro level are, therefore, taken into account. However, I accept the points made by the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. George) about proportionality in relation to the scale of the exercise. By their nature, most small food
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 278</span>
enterprises carry fewer risks than large ones. The reason for that is partly that their supply chain is simpler, and usually sourced from a local area, and that their customer base, similarly, is less scattered. It is, therefore, much easier to trace a product through the supply chain than it is in the case of a large business. The processes involved are often much simpler, and there is less risk attached in terms of the number of human beings likely to touch the various items or have contact with other processes and products. Small processors tend to carry a much lower risk, and that should be recognised in the regulatory framework that is applied. Larger suppliers tend to have supply chains drawn out across the country, which requires much more complex methods to discover where a product has gone and where it was sourced. They also use far more complex processes, in which the likelihood of cross-contamination is far greater.<br><br>
It is not necessary for the Minister to accept the amendment, but I hope that she will summarise how the Government will deal with the needs of small businesses in the food sector. Proportionality must be used in regulating against risk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the amendment would be to suggest that the cost effects on small businesses were more important than other matters of which the agency must take account. Clearly, that would not be correct. However, I hope that I can provide the hon. Member for St. Ives with some reassurance. I want especially to respond to the point made by his hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight about the importance of regulations being in plain English, which ensures that the purpose of their application and the way in which they are expected to be applied is readily understood and unambiguous. I entirely accept that point.<br><br>
The amendment adds nothing to the Bill, for the reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) has already given. Clause 23 already requires the agency to take account of risks, costs and benefits, which includes the probable effects on small businesses. That will be underpinned by the requirement in clause 22 to consult interested parties wherever possible. In addition to the requirements in clause 23, the agency, like other Government Departments, will be expected to follow the principles of the "Better Regulation" guide, published by the Cabinet Office, when considering new regulation. The Government's guidance for carrying out regulatory impact assessment expressly requires that the impact on small businesses should be addressed, so it was never intended that the agency should impose disproportionate burdens on small businesses—or, indeed, on any other type of business. It is worth remembering that food safety is the responsibility of everyone in the food chain. We must not imply—I am not saying that the hon. Member for St. Ives was suggesting this—that any individual sectors are automatically special cases or that lower standards can be tolerated.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
We must keep in mind that the agency's main task is to protect public health, but that it is right that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0601">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 279</span>
agency should take a proportionate and flexible approach. The risk-related framework in the Food Safety (General Food Hygiene) Regulations 1995 are useful for small businesses in that respect, because they require the introduction of controls that are commensurate with the nature of the individual business and the risks involved. I hope that, following my clarification and reassurance, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply has helped to reassure me that there is some recognition of the impact that the agency will have on small businesses. As I believe I made clear in my opening remarks, there is no suggestion in the amendment that the small business sector should be immune from setting the highest possible standards of food hygiene. There is no suggestion that lower standards should apply to small businesses or that there should be some sort of caveat, which would exclude small businesses from the clause.<br><br>
I must correct the Minister's first statement that the amendment suggests that the impact of regulations on small businesses should be more important than other factors. It is not a question of whether the likely impact of regulations and decisions should be more important, but that they are significant and should be taken into account. I have never said, and would not say, that the interests of small businesses are more important than food hygiene regulations, and there is no intention to imply that.<br><br>
This is an important area and, although the Minister's reply contained reassuring words, it may be an area that requires further debate. I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment, but I should like to flag up, if that is a parliamentary expression, the need for further debate on the matter on Report—if it is acceptable for me to point that out at this stage. I seek your guidance, Mr. Hood.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That will be a matter for the Speaker on Report. Would the hon. Gentleman like to withdraw his amendment?</span></p>

<p>No. 60, in Clause 24, page 13, line 15, leave out subsection (9).</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak only to amendments Nos. 126 and 131, as we shall withdraw our other amendments in the group. Some of the arguments have already been covered, and we do not want to detain the Committee on matters about which we have already had a good debate.<br><br>
The amendments propose alternative wording and are designed to achieve the same objective. The wording was devised by the National Consumer Council, to attribute correctly the source of the information that has given rise to our desire to change the Bill in this way.<br><br>
The clause gives the Secretary of State the power to issue directions to the agency. It could be used if the agency fails to comply with the statement of objectives, to take account of the advice of advisory committees or to consider risks, costs and benefits in exercising its functions. If the agency subsequently failed to comply with such directions, the Secretary of State could remove its members from office, so the powers are important.<br><br>
The relationship between the agency and the Secretary of State lies at the heart of the agency's independence, which we want to be as strong as possible. We want it to be perceived to be as independent as possible in the public eye. Those direction-making powers may threaten the agency's independence or harm that public perception of its independence. It is, therefore, important that the Secretary of State should be required to publish his reasons for issuing directions, so that he is fully accountable when he takes such action.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 126 and 131 are broadly similar, but the wording of amendment No. 126 gets closest to our objective. Amendment No 126 would ensure that, regardless of which authority issues direction under the clause, it should publish it and give reasons for issuing it.<br><br>
The way in which the Minister and the agency relate to each other in making decisions will be key in determining perceived independence. We are worried that the Bill contains a great deal of decision making, which to needs to be as transparent as possible.<br><br>
Earlier clauses provided for power of entry and power to make observations—without the reasons for entry and for making observations having to be given. In that instance, we understand why that is so. It may be fully in the public interest for those two powers to be exercised in that way. However, when the agency can give clear reasons, it should do so, and that should be specified in the Bill.<br><br>
Giving reasons for a direction could help educate businesses that carry out functions similar to that to which the direction applies. Little would be gained from giving narrow direction unilaterally to the business involved, as it would mean depending, only on an ad hoc basis, on other businesses in a similar position getting word about the implications of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0602">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 281</span>
direction that has come down from the agency. The failure to give reasons would give credence to the view that the agency is part of a faceless bureaucracy. No member of the Committee would want such criticism to be levelled at the agency. For those reasons, we are keen that the Bill should be amended.<br><br>
There is no question but that transparency would contribute to consumer confidence in the independence of the agency. We have been a little unsure about the relationship between the Minister and the agency, and about how transparent it is. Of course, we understand that emergency control orders must come from the Minister—that will be understood by the public—but wherever possible, the reasons for making decisions and giving directions should be made transparent so that the public have greater confidence in the agency, which will then do a better job in creating the right framework for high standards of food safety.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Maclean (Penrith and The Border)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden on amendment No. 126, which is vital. It will help to ameliorate some of the other draconian powers in the clause, especially in subsection (7). In that subsection, we see the fig leaf blown off the agency: it is independent; it can do as it likes, free from Government interference, except that if a Minister so decides, all its members can be sacked. In the old days, universities used to become very upset about such security-of-tenure clauses.<br><br>
Academic freedom in universities is guaranteed only by the fact that the people appointed to chairs and doctorates cannot be dismissed easily on the whim of a Minister, the principal or anyone else. The independent people in the agency will always have a sword of Damocles hanging over them; they will be totally independent, except that they can lose their jobs, civil service pensions, all their rights, benefits and privileges, and become unemployable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 282</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to my hon. Friend in a moment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 126 is important because the Minister must state the reasons why he or she gives directions to the agency, so that no one has any doubt about the Government's view if they disagree with the agency. It is extraordinary that those independent people could be sacked, dismissed or chopped and lose all their pension rights because the Minister decided that the agency had not performed its duties under clause 23, and that the Minister would not have to give reasons for doing so. The Minister will no doubt say that, in the highly unlikely circumstances of his sacking all the members of the agency, he would expect to give reasons because the Opposition would ask questions and Parliament would be concerned. That may be so, but there is no harm in including such a provision at the end of subsection (8).<br><br>
Amendment No. 126, under which the Government would have to give the reasons for any direction that they gave, is absolutely vital. It would provide transparency and ensure that the public had no doubt about what would happen if the Government were to exercise their powers under any of the subsections in the clause, including that which I single out as being the most draconian—subsection (7), the power to sack members of the agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendments do not relate to subsection (7).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments. Nos. 126 and 131 relate to subsection (8) and would mean that reasons had to be given if the Minister implemented any direction. One of the directions that the Minister might give is contained in subsection (7), which could result in people being sacked. Nevertheless, the Government may give the agency other directions, and whenever they exercise those powers, it is vital that the reasons be given.</span></p>
