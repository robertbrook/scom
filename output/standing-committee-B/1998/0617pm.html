ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION: TAXES AND DUTIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [<i>this day</i>]: No. 201, in page 84, line 8, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2) This clause will not come into effect until a referendum on Britain's participation in Economic and Monetary Union has been held.'.—[<i>Mr. Gibb.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Whittingdale <span class='memberconstituency'>(Maldon and East Chelmsford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that we have had this opportunity of debating economic and monetary union. Until now, the Government have been anxious to avoid discussing the matter at almost any cost and during the recent European election campaign they were happy to talk about any issue other than Europe. After publication of the national changeover plan, to which the clause directly relates, they refused all the requests of my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition to debate the matter on the Floor of the House. Our only previous opportunity to do so arose when the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) was fortunate in obtaining a Wednesday morning Adjournment debate and I had the opportunity of debating the matter with the Economic Secretary. It is notable that no Government time has been available to debate one of the most important issues facing the country.<br><br>
I had thought that the clause might not be debated because the Government might withdraw it following recent events. Since publication of the Bill, there has been a continual decline in the value of the euro—it fell yet again against the pound yesterday—and last week the British people voted overwhelmingly to reject the single currency. However, we are being required to debate a clause that will issue a blank cheque. We were told that the Government would exercise tight control over public expenditure and the Chancellor prided himself on how he would allow expenditure only if it was scrutinised and justified. Yet the explanatory notes state:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Revenue Departments may need to spend some tens of millions of pounds on preparations".</p></blockquote>
The clause will provide them with the ability to do so.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) referred to the matter in his speech. It is simply not good enough for the Committee to be asked to approve such sums with no further indication of precisely how much we are talking about. The Economic Secretary's reply was inadequate in that she did not even attempt to answer the questions asked by my right hon. Friend. I hope
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 688</span>
that she will now tell the Committee the precise sums involved.<br><br>
The clause relates to the expenditure which Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue may have to make to prepare for the possible introduction of the euro. The explanatory notes state that that may require
<br><blockquote><p>"tens of millions of pounds".</p></blockquote>
If it will cost Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue tens of millions of pounds, how much will it cost British industry to prepare for an event that is unlikely to happen? Again, the Government have refused to try to quantify how much it will cost to go into the single currency.<br><br>
Estimates have been made and I want to put on the record some of the evidence that we have received about the sums involved. The British Retail Consortium has estimated that the total cost of preparation is between £1.7 billion and £3.5 billion. Eurocommerce suggests that the cost to the European retail sector is around 1.8 per cent, of annual turnover, or up to £25 billion which equals approximately £40 per head for each of Europe's 372 million citizens. Marks and Spencer has estimated that it will cost roughly £100 million to install new systems and technology. That implies a cost to the UK retail sector as a whole of about £2 billion.<br><br>
The sums involved are huge, yet the Chancellor is asking British industry to start spending without knowing whether it need do so. Our amendment would show that the Government have made it clear that we should not participate in the euro unless a referendum records a positive vote. It is unrealistic and absurd to ask the taxpayer and British industry to start spending such sums without first holding a referendum. The amendment would require that a referendum take place before any expenditure is incurred.<br><br>
The failure to debate this issue is causing huge concern in all quarters of the House. I draw the Government's attention again to early-day motion 185, which calls on the Government
<br><blockquote><p>"to publish a White Paper on the constitutional, economic and political implications of the United Kingdom joining the European single currency."</p></blockquote>
It was signed by more than 100 Members of Parliament, including Liberal Democrats, Ulster Unionists and a number of leading Labour Members. By an extraordinary coincidence, the Committee of Selection appears to have overlooked those signatories when deciding on the composition of our Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geraint Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is about to say that he is going to add his name to the early-day motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If an early-day motion with 100 signatories is a subject worthy of debate, the hon. Gentleman may like to know that my early-day motion, calling for first aid to be part of the national

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 689</span>
curriculum in schools, has more than 200 signatories. Therefore, it should be debated for twice as long.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that right hon. and hon. Members will not be tempted to rise to say how many signatories there are to each of their early-day motions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I were Leader of the House of Commons, I would doubtless find the hon. Gentleman's case convincing. Unfortunately, he must address his remarks to his own Government, not me.<br><br>
The Government have embarked on a policy of taking this country into the European single currency by stealth. The clause forms part of that objective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Halton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given that the Government have made it clear that there will be a referendum on entry into the single currency, how can the hon. Gentleman make that ridiculous comment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The whole point of our amendment is to show that the Government are committing tens of millions of pounds without a referendum. If the hon. Gentleman is committed to the idea of a referendum, I invite him to vote for the amendment, which would ensure that a referendum takes place before such expenditure is incurred.<br><br>
I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to a letter sent to accounting officers, authorising expenditure on what can only be described as propaganda in favour of the single currency, and to a letter sent to national health service trusts, which threatens that a contract with a supplier might not be made unless it demonstrates an intention to make its software euro compliant.<br><br>
A vast exercise is being undertaken to create the impression that participation in the European single currency is inevitable. Before lunch, the Economic Secretary suggested that British industry fully supports that objective and, in doing so, quoted Lord Marshall. I shall quote the Director General of the Institute of Directors, who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Not content with having frittered away £7.5 million of taxpayers money in advertising the euro, the Government now wants the public sector and business to spend millions of pounds preparing for something that may not be right for the economy nor have the support of the British people. Neither Government nor business should invest precious resources in preparing for the euro unless first, the Chancellor's five economic tests are met, and second,"—</p></blockquote>
this is the critical point—
<br><blockquote><p>"the British people vote for the introduction of the euro in a referendum. The Government's changeover plan is a classic example of putting the cart before the horse."</p></blockquote>
Furthermore, Sir Stanley Kalms, the chairman of Dixons, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Changing our systems to accept the euro would cost £40 million. If the public say no to the euro, which seems likely, that money would be wasted".</p></blockquote>
The Government are asking the Committee to authorise the expenditure of tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, without first bothering to ask the British people whether that is what they want.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 690</span>
Last week we saw evidence that the overwhelming majority of the British people are opposed to British entry into a single currency. If the Government really believe that it is in the interest of British industry, the British economy and the British people that we prepare for entry, let them have the courage to accept the amendment, so that if expenditure of this nature takes place it will do so with the authority of the British people in a full referendum.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 254, in page 86, line 10, leave out from 'instrument' to end of line 11 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'which shall not be made unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, the House of Commons'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may also consider amendment No. 255, in page 86, line 26, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'9A. Regulations under this section shall only be made after first being published in draft form for the purposes of consultation with relevant trade bodies and after such consultation process has been completed.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These two amendments have been tabled to prise out of the Government some information about what they intend to do about consultation. Amendment No. 254 urges the Government to pass the regulations that will be introduced under the clause by the affirmative resolution procedure because the Government are introducing too many statutory instruments by negative resolution procedure. I believe that hon. Members would prefer these regulations to be approved by the House through the affirmative resolution procedure.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0391">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 691</span>
Amendment No. 255 deals with the question of consultation. The Chartered Institute of Taxation has suggested that a full consultation exercise needs to be undertaken before the regulations are finalised in order to prepare a manual of best practice. In addition, the institute says that Government Departments need to adopt a single view on the future of electronic communications, as it believes that an expert group should be set up to take the project forward. I look forward to hearing the Government's response to both of those points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 122 and schedule 20 make provisions for electronic services to be provided, so that taxpayers who wish to file accounts and make payments electronically can do so. Of course, there is no compulsion on taxpayers to use electronic services if they prefer to send information on paper. However, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) outlined, the amendments would require regulations to be made by positive resolution, rather than by negative resolution procedure, and would require trade bodies to be consulted. In this clause, we are responding to taxpayers' needs and catering for those who want to send tax information electronically.<br><br>
The regulations made under this clause will do no more than give taxpayers an alternative to sending their tax returns on paper. However, the regulations will need to set out in detail the precise nature of any new electronic service. Discussion of material about detailed technical matters is inappropriate for the affirmative resolution procedure. Of course, such specifications are a matter for consultation with interested parties, such as representatives of taxpayers and businesses and tax practitioners, not just trade bodies.<br><br>
I am glad to say that the revenue departments have already shown—for example, with the development of the Revenue's electronic lodgement service and the simplification of Customs' freight procedures—that they can work closely with the private sector and representative groups, and it would be wrong for their ability to make regulations to be constrained as suggested.<br><br>
The amendments would mean that regulations providing for even relatively minor changes to existing services would have to be the subject of both formal consultation and the positive resolution procedure. That cannot be a proper use of departmental resources or parliamentary time. We are already setting up an expert group to look at service delivery of electronic communications by the Revenue and Customs, but there is no need to introduce the constraint or additional burden on departmental resources and parliamentary time that is suggested in the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Healey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wentworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the clause is part of a quiet revolution in the way that the Government conduct business, in particular, in the relationship between Government and citizen? The clause allows us to meet part of the tough target that requires 25 per cent, of Government transactions to be conducted in an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 692</span>
electronic form by 2002. The Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise are leading the way</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. He makes an important point about the Government's determination to transform the way in which we deliver services to citizens and taxpayers, and the way in which they communicate with us. However, an aspect of the technological revolution is the extraordinary speed with which software and technological possibilities are changing. There is a need for constant consultation and partnership with the private sector and expert groups on such matters. There will sometimes be a need for a rapid response in regulations to technical changes on technical matters. In light of the reassurance that proper consultation will occur before regulations are laid before the House, I hope that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) will withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced by the Economic Secretary's response to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. We must get this right. We will have four, five or six years to perfect the administration for the electronic communication of tax affairs. That sunset period will end when the regulations are right, and I hope that they will be drawn loosely enough to take technological change into account. It would be silly if they were not, because that would make for bad regulations.<br><br>
The amendments are appropriate. The House should closely monitor the revolution. The uproar that greeted the proposals for legislating on electronic commerce shows the necessity for parliamentary debate on such regulations. We are not trying to stop development; we want to ensure that the Government get it right. The regulations should be loosely drafted. We often try to prevent the Government from being trigger-happy with regulations. The amendments would enable us to ensure that this complicated issue is not littered with mistakes.<br><br>
I hope that the Economic Secretary will reflect on that. I also hope that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton agrees that the Government have not considered the specific characteristics of the change in tax administration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak on the amendments or the clause until I heard the Economic Secretary's dismissive language. She seemed to be saying that we should not be troubled by the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton because it would waste our time and that of Parliament. This issue is of immense importance. I am surprised that she has not realised the full import of clause 122(4), which specifies a power to make provision
<br><blockquote><p>"for facilitating the use of electronic communications",</p></blockquote>
including a power to make
<br><blockquote><p>"such provision as the persons exercising the power think fit … as to the manner of proving for any purpose"</p></blockquote>
information in the categories that it then lists.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0392">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 693</span>
When we have to deal with the difficulties that our constituents encounter in their attempts to deliver information within a time scale to the Inland Revenue, we realise that the proof of whether something arrived in time can be central and germane to their case. The system of penalties that operates under the self-assessment rules means that such proof is essential. Subsection (4) deals with the way in which such matters, which might be crucial if a citizen is to avoid a substantial penalty, could be proved electronically. However, unless the Government decide to give time, by virtue of an Opposition prayer under the negative resolution procedure, we shall not be allowed to debate how those measures—which could have a profound effect on the people we represent—will operate. We have all dealt with difficult cases involving material that has been travelling between our constituents and the Revenue.<br><br>
It is distressing that the Government do not have the courage of their convictions regarding some of the more important aspects of the ways in which those powers are to be implemented. In rejecting the amendment, they are declining to come to the House of Commons and spend an hour and a half every so often to debate the contents of the regulations that will put clause 122 into effect. It is a sad day when Treasury Ministers, who get only one outing a year on the Finance Bill, cannot come back to explain the regulations via the affirmative procedure. It would be good not only for democracy but for the taxpayers, our constituents. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall leave the personal comments of the Whip to one side. I am more concerned that Treasury Ministers should stand up in public to explain and justify these procedures.<br><br>
The Economic Secretary has shown herself to be willing to listen, to consult and, occasionally, to consort with representatives of the City and the accountancy profession. She knows the importance of this type of communication and I am surprised that she, with her immense experience in consumer affairs, is unwilling to put before Parliament important matters relating to the relationship between the taxpayer and the Board of the Inland Revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful to hon. Members if I respond to the points that have been made. I regret that my earlier response did not address the concerns expressed from the Opposition Front Bench.<br><br>
I must stress the nature of the regulations that will be laid under the clause. I understand the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) about the importance of getting regulation right. Indeed, with our better regulation unit, the Government have taken an important initiative in reducing the quantity, and improving the quality, of regulation.<br><br>
In relation to the clauses and the schedule, the regulations will simply ensure that the existing rights and obligations of taxpayers, properly conferred and defined by Parliament, can be exercised and met electronically, rather than on paper. The regulation will be simple and limited. As I have said, any regulations of this kind will be the subject of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 694</span>
consultation with tax practitioners, trade representative bodies, and businesses. However, some of the regulations are minor and technical in nature. It would be wrong, in terms of the proper custodianship of public resources, for every such regulation to be subject to the full consultation process required by the amendment.<br><br>
As I said earlier, the Government propose to set up a joint expert group, which will help to produce a manual of best practice. The right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) will recall from his extensive ministerial experience, which I am sure included the laying of a large number of regulations using the negative procedure, that that is the appropriate way to deal with relatively minor and technical matters. Proper consultation will take place, as it does already, with those who will be affected and those who have an interest in the nature of the regulations.</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vincent Cable <span class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say a few words in support of these well-judged and appropriate amendments? I had not intended to speak, either, but as an office-bearer of the all-party internet group, I have an interest in promoting on-line government and internet use, and I heard the Economic Secretary refer several times to technical and minor measures. I am worried by the confidence with which issues are dismissed or compartmentalised as "technical and minor".<br><br>
I shall give a few examples of matters that were regarded in the past as "technical and minor", but had enormous ramifications, My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton mentioned the e-commerce controversies, which originally centred on a technical point about encryption. Initially, few people had a clue what encryption was. It was the kind of problem that nerds tended to worry about, and its significance for policy was ignored. Its enormous policy implications have now been understood, and the Government have rightly responded to relevant initiatives. However, its significance could have been recognised at an earlier stage.<br><br>
The issue of information directories is also relevant in that regard. About six months ago, I put a question to Department of Trade and Industry Ministers on that matter—indeed, the Financial Secretary, who was previously in the DTI, answered it. She may not be aware that her civil servants rang me up beforehand to ask me what information directories were. They were concerned about why Members of Parliament were asking questions about such a technical subject, which, in the long term, may have major policy implications. The benefit of the doubt should lie in parliamentary scrutiny.<br><br>
Although the Committee is not discussing the tax aspects of information policy, in the past few months the Government have made a terrible hash of their relations with the information technology community. That is a result of IR 35, with which many of us are still battling. I do refer not to the pros and cons of the tax, but to the Government's failure to understand the technical problems associated with the functioning of that industry and serious technical fall-out questions.

The Government should show some humility and openness, and allow Parliament to consider those issues before they become too difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, was alarmed by the Economic Secretary's response to points made by Opposition Members today. The phrase, "merely minor, technical regulations" is alarming, especially as it implies that consultation on, or parliamentary scrutiny of, such issues would be a waste of departmental and parliamentary resources.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must correct the hon. Gentleman on one point. I did not say that consultation would be a waste of time or resources. Indeed, I went to some pains to stress that consultation would take place. I did say—and I hold by it—that the formal consultation process required by the amendment would not be a sound use of public resources.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am unclear about how a formal consultation process differs from an informal consultation process. The key point is that a consultation process should take place. It is not a waste of departmental resources to consult, formally or informally, on regulations. In a democracy, it is essential that intensive consultation takes place before laws—which, however minor and technical, we are all expected to obey—are passed.<br><br>
What the Economic Secretary may regard as minor and technical may not be minor and technical to others. I have noticed, during my time on Finance Bill Committees, that Labour Treasury Ministers elected since May 1997—I do not single out the Economic Secretary—tend to regard taxation policy as less important than Treasury Ministers, particularly my right hon. Friends, in the past. The Minister's colleagues in the Treasury may not be interested in some of the more technical measures, but they are sometimes controversial and arouse considerable interest. That is why the Opposition must table amendments more frequently than in the past and insist on the affirmative resolution procedure when the Government intend to produce regulations.<br><br>
Treasury Ministers seem to rely increasingly on Inland Revenue and Customs officials in presenting the Bill to the Committee and tabling amendments to it. I am not saying that the officials are likely to be wrong, but in a democracy it is important for Ministers, who are accountable to Parliament, to have an active interest in those measures. If there is a perceived lack of interest by Ministers, it is beholden on those of us in Parliament, whether on the Government Back Benches or the Opposition Benches, to redouble our efforts to ensure that the measures are scrutinised when they come before Parliament. The amendment was tabled to ensure that any regulations emanating from the Treasury during a Labour Government receive particularly thorough scrutiny.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for her response to this wide and thorough debate, which has received more support than I expected when tabling the amendment. Given the wide support for our comments, I hope that she will give thought to our
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 696</span>

THE DEBT MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Guildford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This could be called a tit-for-tat clause: in return for giving the Bank of England an element of independence, the Treasury is getting its own back by taking over management of the national debt. This is a technical clause to achieve that. Throughout its history, the Bank of England has successfully managed the country's debt, despite the problems of many Labour Governments in the past, and I regret that the Bank is to be deprived of that role.<br><br>
In recent weeks we have seen a specific reason for the Bank to keep that role. While it dealt in the market in the business of the national debt, it had a good and open reason for a long and strong dialogue with the market. That dialogue could extend to all aspects of debt and finance, and it both informed the Bank's opinions and improved its view of what was happening in the world. It enabled the Bank to ask questions without the market suspecting its true agenda.<br><br>
The other day we had an example of how that could have been useful when the Government announced that they were selling half their gold reserves. I would like to think that they took advice only from the Bank of England, because there is a risk in discussing the matter with the market, but there is concern that people in the market might have got wind of that sale. Some major trading houses and international organisations in the City of London have a short position in gold today, and there is a reason for that. The risk of the Government inadvertently showing their hand will be far greater when the management of their operations in the London market is under the control of the Treasury instead of the Bank of England.<br><br>
The clause is regrettable. It is also very complex. The way in which interest will be paid on discount securities, as described in the explanatory notes, shows that the shift from the Bank of England was ill thought-out. The change was quite unnecessary and has caused many technical problems, which the Bank is trying to resolve. The argument that the Bank of England should no longer control debt issuance because it now controls interest rates is spurious. As the Bank has shown, its decisions on interest rates are as transparent as possible. As I said this morning, when the Select Committee commented on EMU, it showed great appreciation for the transparency of an independent Bank of England.<br><br>
It is absurd to argue that a transparent Bank of England that controls interest rates should not also control the national debt, but that is the rationale behind the clause. I look forward to hearing any

defence of the clause that the Economic Secretary might muster.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) said, this is, for the most part, a technical clause that will fine tune the new debt and cash management arrangements in last year's Finance Act. He made the extraordinary comment that the Government were at risk of inadvertently showing their hand. He seems not to have grasped the nature and importance of our commitment to a transparent economic policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Economic Secretary regret that, as a result of that transparency, the value of this country's gold reserves has dropped by $600 million in the past few weeks?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman has read the account of our proceedings in yesterday's <i>Hansard.</i> In any case, he was present when I stressed that it would have been neither proper nor prudent for the Government to try to dispose of some of our gold reserves through secretive sales in the gold market. Had we proceeded by covert sale, which the hon. Gentleman appears to favour, we would have seriously destabilised the market and given rise to rumours about the intention of certain central banks to reduce their gold reserves. That might have led to further intense rumour and inaccurate speculation on how much gold was to be sold. Far better to proceed in a transparent and orderly fashion by explaining—as the International Monetary Fund also will—how much gold we intended to sell, when we intended to sell it and how we intended to sell it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Economic Secretary admitted yesterday, there was intense speculation and rumour in the market, and the market price, which fell by more than 10 per cent., was destabilised. Therefore, will she recognise that her policy, however well intentioned, has failed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. When I quoted the Governor of the Bank of England yesterday, I said that the market reaction to our announcement was somewhat overdone. That merely underlines my point on the danger of proceeding covertly.<br><br>
Apart from fine tuning the arrangements, the clause will complete the separation of monetary policy and debt management operations to ensure that there is no conflict of interest between the Bank of England's responsibility for monetary policy and for debt management operations. It will also assure the market that debt management decisions are not influenced by inside information on interest rate decisions, which is the risk that would have been run had the Bank of England retained responsibility for debt management operations alongside its new independence on monetary policy.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor's decision in May 1997 to give the Bank of England operational independence for monetary policy has given this country an intensely successful monetary policy framework that is delivering the lowest interest and mortgage rates for more than 30 years. The clause
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 698</span>
completes the process of securing the new and successful monetary policy framework by separating from the Bank the debt management function, ensuring that there is no possibility of actual or perceived conflict of interest, thus reinforcing the success of the new monetary policy framework. It is a great pity that the official Opposition continue to oppose the independence that we have given the Bank of England and the highly successful new monetary policy.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the highly expert staff at the Bank of England, who have been dealing with debt management for many years, transfer to the Treasury so that they can continue their skilled work? What will be the arrangements?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debt management office will take over the whole of the Exchequer cash management function by the end of the financial year. It will be fully staffed with the appropriate experts.<br><br>
To return to my earlier point, the Conservative party appears to oppose the operational independence of the Bank of England.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary give way again?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss Government amendment No. 64.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The new clause extends the scope of the millennium gift aid scheme. It adds an additional purpose for which donations may be made under the scheme.<br><br>
In recent weeks, we have witnessed the humanitarian crisis that unfolded in Kosovo and neighbouring countries such as Albania and Macedonia. The scale of that crisis poses an enormous challenge to the agencies that are working so hard to relieve the plight of the Kosovans. We believe that they need all the support that they can get, which is why we are working closely with other nations and international organisations to help the refugees and the countries in the region. We recently doubled our humanitarian aid from £20 million to £40 million and contributed to an EU package of 250 million euros to provide humanitarian and budgetary assistance to Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro, and pressed for its rapid dispersal.<br><br>
The British public have been extraordinarily generous in responding to the appeals of the major aid charities. I am sure that we have all seen that generosity in our constituencies. The new clause will enable their donations to go further by ensuring that the millennium gift aid scheme covers the work that British charities are doing with Kosovan refugees. The Government are backing that up with practical help to those raising funds for Kosovo, including printing and distributing more than a million leaflets to churches and other charities.<br><br>
The millennium gift aid scheme already applies to Albania and Macedonia, to where many Kosovans have fled, and many donations for the refugees are already being made through the scheme. However, it does not yet apply to Montenegro or to Kosovo itself, as the refugees prepare to return to their homes there. Nor does it apply to the various wealthy countries around the world, including the United Kingdom, who are giving shelter and a safe haven to the refugees.<br><br>
The new clause responds to the challenge of the relief effort and the changing nature of that effort, by adding to the scheme an additional purpose for which donations may be made, which will apply
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 700</span>
retrospectively from 6 April this year. The new purpose being added is the relief of the poverty of refugees from any country or territory designated for this purpose, and, of course, it is intended to designate Kosovo.<br><br>
The extension of millennium gift aid means that donors and charities can be certain that donations to help Kosovan refugees will come within the scheme, wherever those refugees are living, including when they have returned to their homes in Kosovo. I commend the new clause to the Committee.</span></p>

TREATMENT OF TRANSFER FEES UNDER EXISTING CONTRACTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'.—(1) Subject to subsection (2) below, where—
<ol>
<li>a contract is or has been entered into by a football or other sports club to secure the services of a player; and</li>
<li>the contract is or was entered into before the beginning of the first accounting period of the club in relation to which a relevant financial reporting standard has effect (whether by virtue of the adoption of the standard by the club or otherwise),<br><br> nothing in the standard shall be taken to affect the manner in which any fee required to be paid by the club under the contract may be taken into account in computing the club's profits to be charged under Case I of Schedule D.</li></ol>

<li>Subsection (1) above shall not apply if the club so elects by a notice given to an officer of the Board within the period of two years beginning immediately after the accounting period described in subsection (1)(b) above.</li>

<ol>
<li>Financial Reporting Standard 10 issued by the Accounting Standards Board on 4th September 1997; and</li>

<li>All such adjustments shall be made (whether by way of assessment, amendment of an assessment, repayment of tax or otherwise) as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions of this section.</li>
<li>Subsection (4) above has effect notwithstanding any time limits relating to the making or amendment of an assessment for any accounting period.'.—[<i>Mrs. Roche.</i>]</li></ol></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
This new clause is designed to help football and other sports clubs adjust to new accounting rules. The new accounting rules affect the treatment of intangible assets. The change is of particular importance to sums paid for players by association football clubs. The rights to a player's services are an intangible asset of his club, so sums paid to obtain those services are within the new accounting standard.<br><br>
In the past, those sums were usually charged to clubs' profit and loss accounts in the year in which they were due. That treatment was followed for tax, thereby giving tax relief for the full amount paid under the contract in the year in which it was signed.<br><br>
The new standard applies for accounting periods ending broadly after 22 December 1998. It now
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0396">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 701</span>
requires the cost to be spread over the life of the contract, and not to be given all up front. The Revenue will follow the accounting treatment for future payments so that tax relief is given later than in the past. The new clause does not affect that.<br><br>
The new clause governs the treatment of contracts made before the period in which the accounting standard is applied by the club. The proportion of the purchase price of the player that relates to services in future periods would normally have to be brought into charge to tax and then a deduction given over the remainder of each player's contract. In effect, it would mean clawing back some of the tax relief already enjoyed, and then spreading it forward over the remaining life of the contract. Football clubs would have been faced with an additional tax bill in the short term, which would have been matched by relief given in later years. New clause 3 is designed to ease the transition by preserving the tax treatment already given for such players before Financial Reporting Standard 10 applied. That avoids the unexpected transitional tax impact. Thus the new clause is all about the timing of tax relief, not the overall amount paid.<br><br>
The Chancellor announced this change in the Budget. At that time, it was confined to association football clubs, because they were the only clubs who had made representations on the matter. We have, however, decided to widen the provision so that it applies to other sports clubs similarly affected by the new accounting standard. There have been no indications that any other sport is affected, but we have extended the provision to deal with that possibility.<br><br>
The announcement of this transitional relief has been welcomed, especially by the football clubs affected, and I am sure that the Committee will agree that sports clubs are in a special position. Many of them struggle to survive, and their main concern is with the sport itself rather than with making a profit. I commend new clause 3 to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given that the Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Reporting Standard 10 on 4 September 1997 and Financial Reporting Standard for Smaller Entities on 10 December 1998, why were those provisions not included in the Bill when it was published on 9 March?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Football clubs recognised the difficulty not long before the Budget, and we did not have time to draft the provisions before the Bill was published. Football clubs and their advisers welcomed the Budget announcement because they were assured that the relief would be available. It was then that the other clubs made their representations, and we acted speedily and promptly. The Government are to be commended for their swift action.</span></p>

<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
New clause 8 makes two improvements to the rules for venture capital trusts. VCTs are developing well as a source of funding for small trading companies that have great potential but that might otherwise be overlooked by venture capitalists. A sign of the scheme's success is that VCT-backed companies are now beginning to come to the public equity market and are looking for further investment to finance growth and development. The changes that we propose demonstrate our continuing support for the scheme.<br><br>
The first change improves how the VCT rules apply to companies that are preparing for flotation. A company that seeks flotation before it has generated sufficient profits to offset earlier losses must float as a new holding company that owns the existing company. To achieve that, shareholders extend their shares and securities in the existing company for an equivalent investment in the holding company.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 706</span>
Under the current VCT rules, the shares and securities in the new holding company do not count towards the fixed proportion of qualifying investments that a VCT must hold, even if the original investments did so. That raises the possibility of a successful flotation leading to the loss of VCT approval and the consequent withdrawal of tax relief from individual investors in the VCT. The effect of the new clause will be to treat the VCT's shares and securities in the new holding company as meeting the VCT rules to the same extent as its holding of shares and securities in the existing company. That ensures that the investments continue to qualify and protect the position of individual investors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As time may be of the essence in such situations, can the Minister give the Committee any guidance as to the requirements of the Board of Inland Revenue to give an approval notification according to when the exchange takes place? How long does she think that the board should reasonably take to give such notification?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Revenue will move as quickly as possible, but it is important to protect the scheme's integrity. That is why it is written into the rules.<br><br>
The second change made by the new clause concerns the treatment of convertible shares and securities. A venture capital trust may have convertible shares or securities as part of its qualifying holdings. Under existing VCT rules, when the VCT exercises its conversion rights, the resulting shares drop out of its qualifying holdings, even if they would have qualified if newly issued. Again, that may have consequences for individual investors in VCTs.<br><br>
Conversion is often necessary as part of a further round of financing, or in preparation for flotation. As a minority investor, the VCT may have limited influence on a transaction which could jeopardise its approval as a VCT.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
The effect of the change made by the new clause is similar to that of the reorganisation provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the case of the restructuring purposes, the Government are inserting a requirement that the board should give an approval. If it is a requirement in that case, and as this case is similar, where is it stated that the Government require the board to grant an approval notification before the scheme goes ahead?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, like the industry, will welcome the changes to the scheme. We must protect the scheme's integrity; the board will move as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will forgive me, but I missed the conversion of convertible shares and securities. Where in the proposal is the requirement for the board to give its approval?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman allows me to make progress, he will understand that the effect of the change that the new clause would make is similar to what would happen with the reorganisation provisions. Shares resulting from convertible shares and securities covered by the change will be treated as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0399">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 707</span>
meeting the VCT rules to the same extent as the convertibles. Again, that will protect VCTs and their individual investors from losing approval and tax relief for reasons outside their control.<br><br>
The changes are effective for reconstructions and conversions that take place on or after 16 June 1999. The changes that we propose are a response to issues raised during regular discussions between Government and venture capital trust managers. It is just one example of how the Government are working closely with private sector practitioners to create a better environment for financing the growth of enterprises.<br><br>
Taken together, the changes made by the new clause will allow VCTs that have made earlier-stage investments in growing companies to retain their stake in those companies and share in their success. That in turn should encourage further fund-raising by VCTs, allowing greater investment in the small higher-risk trading companies that the scheme is designed to help.<br><br>
We discussed earlier the importance of VCTs in encouraging more high-growth firms. I commend the new clause to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Financial Secretary revealed on Tuesday, we have known each other since we were at university together just a few years ago. In that time, I do not remember the Financial Secretary often being stumped for an answer, but on this occasion she does not seem to have done her homework. I do not blame her for that. The welter of last-minute amendments that the Chief Secretary has tabled would be enough to give anyone a headache, however many cold towels he wraps around his head.<br><br>
Although the new clause's principles are welcomed on both sides of the Committee, the first part seems to contain a requirement for board approval and formal notification. I may be wrong, but such a requirement does not seem to apply to the second type of change— conversion of convertible shares and securities. Such a requirement is either a good idea or a bad one. Why is it deemed a good idea for securities but a bad one for convertible shares?<br><br>
If such notification is required—which I question— would it not be right to limit the time that the board may take? Small companies, with which VCTs deal, live a rather precarious existence, and an element of certainty in their affairs will always be welcomed. It would be wrong if delays at board level were to prevent companies from raising money or reorganising themselves to secure their future in the fast-moving business world.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point, and, on a note of conciliation, for saying that we were at university together only "a few years ago". When the hon. Gentleman and I knew each other at university, he was in a different political party from his current one, but I shall say no more about that, because you would quickly rule me out of order, Mr. Butterfill.<br><br>
I was surprised by the hon. Gentleman's rather grudging remarks: The industry has warmly welcomed the changes, which his right hon. and hon. Friends did
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 708</span>
not introduce when they were Ministers in the previous Government, and I should have thought that we would have been congratulated. Approval applies to application of VCT tax legislation, not reconstruction. Clearance for conversion is not required.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the time that the board has. As I am sure he will agree, VCT schemes enjoy considerable tax advantages. That is why it is important to protect the scheme's integrity. When the board is required to act, it will do so as quickly as possible. As I am sure he knows, the board is aware of the pressures on small firms and of the time constraints. He also mentioned the rights of conversion, which are already established. This is an important new clause, and I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>

<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
I move the motion with the permission of my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown). In doing so, although I am glad to be known as the taxpayer's friend, I emphasise that it is a testing amendment, and I shall not press it to a vote. We recognise that a radical reduction in the level of duties would have severe short term implications for the Revenue, and we have no desire to impose such changes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Christopher Leslie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Shipley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: How much?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks how much is involved. Page 155 of the Red Book shows that the total amount of revenue from spirit duties is £1.6 billion, a figure that is projected to stay flat in the following year. Given that the millennium year is expected to be a record one for spirit sales, implicit in that figure is an acknowledgement of the long-term problem that underlies the proposal in the new clause. The much higher levels of duty in this country, as opposed to the continent—the new clause would reduce the level of duty to that prevalent in France— will in the long term induce more and more smuggling, which will mean in any case a loss to the Revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Kali Mountford <span class='memberconstituency'>(Colne Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well quoting the Red Book, but what is the cost of the new clause? What are we expected to pay for it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One advantage of being in Government is that one has access to experts who can calculate those figures. I know that the Financial Secretary—who is, apart from on the last new clause, diligent—will have worked that out already. One reason for tabling the new clause was to elicit a precise answer from her. If the cost involved in the new
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0400">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 709</span>
clause were taken literally—I said at the outset that it should not be—I estimate that it would be more than £1 billion. As I said, I am the taxpayers' friend; I always seek to cut taxation. The previous Government cut taxation by billions of pounds while the Government have, over the lifetime of the Parliament, raised general revenue from 37 per cent, to 41 per cent, of GDP—a 4 per cent, increase that is equivalent to more than £35 billion in extra taxation annually. That is the extent to which the Government are the enemy of the tax-paying public.<br><br>
Our point is that, in the long run, at current projections, that revenue will in any case disappear. I make no apology for having responded to a plea from the brewing industry; one brewing firm alone employs over 1,000 people in my constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Borrow <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Ribble)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify one point? I realise that the new clause has been tabled to probe the Government, but is there a point of principle behind it: that excise duties in the UK should be harmonised with those in the rest of the EU? If so, should that be done on a purely voluntary basis or should there be some sort of cross-Europe harmonisation for all the countries in the EU?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It took quite a long time for the hon. Gentleman to get there, but we could tell where he was going. The answer is that we would welcome tax competition; the new clause would require that the Government are efficient, run their affairs properly and do not regard the taxpayer as a milch cow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the whole point that the market solution to harmful tax competition is to reduce taxes in the country where the damage is being done, rather than spend huge amounts on enforcement and introducing vast new schemes such as hotline telephones and all the new offices that are needed to do that important job? Does my hon. Friend agree that the market solution is the best one?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could not have put it better. We have heard an admission from the Government that tax harmonisation is a cover for tax increases. Tax competition is a means of inducing Governments over the long term to cut taxation because all the harmonisation proposals that emerged from the committee chaired by the Paymaster General in Brussels have meant that this country has had to put its taxes up, destroying important businesses, industries and sectors that are valuable to this country—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Borrow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. We have heard enough from the hon. Gentleman. He can make a contribution in due course. Perhaps I shall then review my opinion of his views on the subject that we are considering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leslie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>

One brewing company employs 1,000 people in my constituency.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 710</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be delighted to give way to my right hon. Friend, who has not spoken this afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is remarkable that, in previous weeks, when we debated many important clauses, Labour Members took their Trappist vow seriously, but that suddenly—perhaps due to an end-of-term feeling—they have come alive and want to contribute?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend makes a good point. After the disaster in so many Labour constituencies last week, Government Back Benchers realise that their only hope of salvation is to do their own thing and tell the Whip to get knotted. That will have implications for discipline in Government ranks. The Whip is already so embarrassed that he is laughing. However, we shall have the last laugh about the problem that we are discussing.<br><br>
Let us return to new clause 1. I mentioned a firm in my constituency. It offers good jobs, for which brewing companies now provide training. I am a member of the Select Committee on Education and Employment, which, in its report on further education, took evidence about how the brewing industry trains people who work in pubs and bars. The industry is worried not only about the crippling levels of duty, but about suffering a double whammy: under Further Education Funding Council circular 99/09, the Government will withdraw part of the modest subsidy that is important for setting up training schemes.<br><br>
Today, I heard representations from colleges about the serious impact of that subsidy's withdrawal on the brewing industry and its ability to train in future. Many of its employees intend to go on to greater things, and, through the subsidy, they could receive in-house training on a nationally accredited training scheme, which would be their passport to a better job in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leslie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned his constituency. Can he promise his constituents that his manifesto leaflet at the next general election will include a pledge to cut the duty on beer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to promise my constituents that I will rigorously investigate not only FEFC circular 99/09, but the long-term trend and implications of excessive duty on spirits and wine.<br><br>
That trend has social implications. A cache of illegally imported wine, spirits and tobacco was recently discovered in the precincts of Guildford cathedral. Under-age consumers were using the contents. They became disorderly and got into trouble. Under-age drinking is becoming a social problem in the south of England. It arises because of the excessive disparity between duties in this country and those on the continent. Smugglers are at work; they find a ready market in those who would not otherwise have access to those products, which are not allowed to be sold on legitimate licensed premises, such as off-licences.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0401">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 711</span>
The provision poses a threat to the tax base and to society. There is much anxiety that the brewing sector, which provides training and opportunities for its employees, is being hit yet again. Every time spirits and wines are imported into the country, the distribution network that it is building is hit, as is the investment in those who work in it—investment which benefits them as well as the consumer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed because I expected to hear a speech by the hon. Member for Cotswold. However, I must congratulate him; in the recent reshuffle of Her Majesty's Opposition, he was promoted to the Whips Office. I was a member of the Whips Office in opposition and it is a fine place to be. I have great admiration for Whips; some may say that I am a crawler, but I would say that I am a realist, and I regard Whips as fine people. I was shocked to hear the interesting language that the hon. Member for Guildford used about Whips, and I admonish him in strong terms on behalf of all present and former Whips. I looked forward to hearing from the hon. Member for Cotswold, because his speech could have been his swan-song in an all-speaking, all-dancing performing role. Perhaps he has gone out for a celebratory beer.<br><br>
Instead we had a performance from the hon. Member for Guildford, who said that there was a risk to our tax base. There would be if he were to get anywhere near government, or even if he were a member of the party in government. Perhaps he took on his role at rather short notice, so I shall be kind to him, but clearly he had not done any homework or preparation for this tutorial.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary knows that she is guying the Committee, and that we in opposition prepare carefully. As I said, I would like to hear from the Treasury Bench the official figure for the cost of the proposal. That would then inform the policy of the Opposition, as well as the thinking of the brewing industry, in coming up with more realistic and long-term proposals to deal with a threat to the tax base that the hon. Lady has brushed aside in previous debates. It will not be brushed aside for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A nice try, but not terribly convincing, given that the hon. Gentleman moved the new clause without having recognised that our latest Budget cut the price of beer in real terms. The Government took the decision to freeze the main alcoholic drinks duty rates, primarily to enable any future changes to be aligned with the spring Budget cycle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I invited the Financial Secretary to show her preparation for the debate by telling us her estimate of what the proposals would cost. In the past, she has been fond of telling us the costs of such proposals. She has had my estimate; what is hers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Everything comes to him who waits. The hon. Gentleman is right; I prepare carefully, especially when he has tabled amendments or new clauses. I know of the great interest that my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) takes in such matters, so I always consider how much such proposals will cost.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 712</span>
The cost of cutting beer duty alone, as proposed in the new clause, would be £2,350 million. In the light of some of the amendments of the hon. Member for Guildford, that is a mere snip. At some point, it might be instructive to add up what his proposals in Committee would have cost. I think that the good citizens of Guildford would wish to know where their Member of Parliament proposes to find the extra money. Would he, perhaps, propose to raise their income tax, make cuts at one of their local hospitals or reduce their children's education services? The good citizens of Guildford could find that information most instructive.<br><br>
The story of cost does not stop there. I am always interested in the costings of the hon. Gentleman's amendments, and I have made further inquiries. That figure does not take into account the fact that under European Union law, we would also have to cut wine duty by an equivalent amount—another £980 million. Therefore, in total the amendment would cost £3,330 million. If the hon. Gentleman would like to do his sums, he will realise that that is the equivalent of nearly 2p on income tax, or 1 percentage point on VAT.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Kali Mountford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may not know about my long-term campaign against under-age drinking and its associated problems, but in view of her answers to the hon. Gentleman, can she assure me that the Government will not go down the route of the extraordinary use of market forces, using that as a solution to under-age drinking and the problems of crime and ill health associated with it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know of my hon. Friend's great interest in this matter. When the Chancellor makes his deliberations, he takes all the factors into account. The Home Secretary has also examined many measures, especially relating to the law and order problems associated with under-age drinking in town centres. My right hon. and hon. Friends take a great interest in such matters.<br><br>
During our earlier deliberations on tobacco, the hon. Member for Guildford and other Opposition Members almost seemed to suggest that because there was a problem with smuggling—a serious issue for the Government and the country—we ought simply to give in to crime and lawlessness. It is important to look at the whole issue in relation to that problem.<br><br>
The proportion of duty in the cost of a pint of beer has fallen. In 1982 tax represented 38 per cent, of the retail selling price. That has now dropped to less than 30 per cent. Yet within two weeks of the Chancellor announcing his freeze on beer duty in this Budget, one large brewer announced an increase in its prices of up to 6p a pint—an increase subsequently followed by three of its major competitors. In his 1997 Budget, the Chancellor increased duty by 1p a pint, yet price increases by some brewers put bar prices up by 8p a pint. The Committee can draw its own conclusions from that.</span></p>

affected by the fact that duty-free sales have been abolished?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed that the hon. Gentleman has the gall to mention that subject. It was the previous Government who negotiated away duty-free sales. I know that he was not a member of that Government, but was he a supporter at that time. I know about his regression, but I am not sure when he made the switch. I commend the role played by the Paymaster General, especially her consultation with the industry on the successor regime. Again, we will do as much as we can to assist in clearing up after the previous Government.<br><br>
The new clause introduced by the hon. Member for Guildford shows yet again the frivolous nature of Opposition amendments, and I urge my hon. Friends to reject it.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the Financial Secretary chose to close her remarks in that way. As my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford outlined, the new clause serves as a probing amendment to elicit from the Government a serious response about the economic and social effects of a serious fiscal difference between the United Kingdom and our European Union partners. That is not frivolous.<br><br>
The issue of fiscal competition is wider than the relatively narrow confines of the new clause, which deals with alcohol duties. The Committee has discussed smuggling, which has a significant effect on our brewing industry and the off-licence trade in the south-east of England. A loss in sales of about 20 per cent, has been attributed to the relative ease with which people can go on so-called booze cruises across the channel. In a frenzy reminiscent of the winter sales, people bring back very large quantities of alcoholic beverages, partly for their own use and partly for resale. That practice has done serious damage, and is now spreading throughout the United Kingdom.<br><br>
The Committee has also discussed the same theme in relation to tobacco duties. I recognise that health, under-age drinking and other social issues are important, but the Government cannot dodge the question of fiscal difference and its effect on the United Kingdom economy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Kali Mountford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may develop another point, I shall give way in a moment.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary has not engaged in an intellectual discussion about significant fiscal differences; instead, she has resorted to a standard cop-out clause, batting our suggestions over the boundary by saying, "Where would you get the £2.35 billion that your ideas would cost?" However, the Government have not been reluctant to raise substantial extra taxation to fund their policies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Kali Mountford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: 1 noticed that the right hon. Gentleman was not here this morning when his hon. Friends were arguing that independent national
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 714</span>
taxation was a virtue. He now seems to be advancing a completely different argument. Furthermore, what is the market solution to cirrhosis of the liver?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The setting of one's own tax regime is a matter of virtue. If we consider the purpose of taxation, however, the principle issue facing a Government is how to raise a given sum of money to meet their obligations to the people. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I could make a very long speech on this subject, so it would be helpful if the hon. Member for Shipley would allow me to develop my point.<br><br>
This country has not had a fundamental discussion about what we tax, how we tax it, and what is the most appropriate way of taxing. Over the decades, Governments of all persuasions have put great emphasis on raising taxation on alcoholic beverages of all kinds, although the new clause focuses on beer. The creation of the single market has exerted pressures and strains on that policy.<br><br>
It is sad that the Financial Secretary has not sought to develop a more philosophical argument to explain why the Government are prepared to continue down a route that causes fiscal friction. This is the Government who have made themselves the consumer's friend. They have coined the phrase "rip-off Britain", and are monitoring price differentials between the United Kingdom and other parts of the world. They are seeking, through the natural pressure of government, to ensure that values in the United Kingdom improve. However, for beverages containing alcohol—in this case, beer—the tax regime is the principal driver, notwithstanding the Financial Secretary's argument about commercial price increases. Such increases may well be a response to, for example, increased employment costs occasioned by the Government. In advancing her arguments, she has said nothing of that. Perhaps the Government's tax policy is the driver of the price differentials that the amendment would address. What will the Government do when they discover that they are responsible for the price differentials that investigation of their price-watching activities might elicit?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Sally Keeble <span class='memberconstituency'>(Northampton, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman accept the difference between a tax levied on a product through the democratic process, and a decision by a retailer to sell a product at an unrealistically high price simply to increase profits? His comparison is wrong, because the processes and the profit margins are completely different.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take that point, and the hon. Lady is right to differentiate, but the differentiation strengthens my case. One way of dealing with retailers who may be over-egging the pudding would be to use competition law. However, it is a different matter when the Government are the principal cause of the problem.<br><br>
I do not want to detain the Committee unnecessarily, but the Financial Secretary should note that the matter raises fundamental issues concerning the way in which taxation is raised in this country. She will know that from time to time her officials advise her on the law of diminishing returns.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0403">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 715</span>
When in government, we realised that there were limits. That is why, for the first time in 50 years, we cut tax on whisky. The Financial Secretary has prayed in aid the freezing of duty on beer, but that will not make the problem, which the amendment would address, go away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Borrow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak to the new clause, but having been unable to intervene for a second time during the speech of the hon. Member for Guildford, and having heard the speech of the right hon. Member for Fylde, I wish to make two brief points. Both speeches touched on an important aspect of taxation policy, which is the recognition that a single market can be distorted by the tax policies of individual Governments.<br><br>
There are pressures on Governments to take into account the effect of different tax levels on the economies of member states. As I understand it, the Opposition believe that the problem should be solved by driving down tax in each state to the lowest level set by any member state, irrespective of the loss of revenue to Governments. That is not a sensible approach. Instead, we should recognise that it is difficult for EU Governments to work on a voluntary basis, and find a way to co-ordinate taxation and minimise loss of revenue.<br><br>
I am not arguing for full tax harmonisation across Europe, but it should be recognised as a factor when setting tax levels for member states. It is not something from which we can run away. My hon. Friend the Minister said that, with regard to excise duties on alcohol, the Government have recognised the difficulty by freezing tax. They have also accepted that the single market across Europe influences United Kingdom tax policy. It is interesting that the official Opposition oppose voluntary discussions within the European Union on tax harmonisation, which they see as a threat to sovereignty. Surely it is sensible that the Governments of member states co-ordinate some aspects of tax policy in a single market. Otherwise they risk a major loss of tax revenue which will produce cuts in the benefits and services provided to the people whom we are supposed to represent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin by welcoming my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold back to the Committee. I know that he has been with us in spirit. He handed me the responsibility for introducing the new clause, which I took up with alacrity. Unlike Ministers, I am not ashamed to say that I believe in low taxation. I explained the principle of independence day. As a Conservative spokesman in the other place, Lord Saatchi, explained in his recent pamphlet, we can spend more on health and education if we have lower overall levels of taxation in the economy, because that produces a more efficient and faster growing economy. A smaller share of a bigger and growing economic pie brings more rewards for all sections of society.<br><br>
Experience in many other parts of the world has proved that time and again. Europe, which takes a high share of national income in taxation, has one of the poorest records of recent growth in any part of the developed world. I am sorry that the Ministers will not heed that lesson. We will have to wait until we are in government to put it into action—and after last
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 716</span>
Sunday's election result, that day will arrive sooner than any Labour Member imagined.<br><br>
I believe that it was William Pitt the younger who proved that by cutting duties on spirits, it is possible to generate more revenue. Fortunately, law-abiding citizens do not subvert the law as much as people did in the 18th century, and the problem of smuggling is not too large. However, there is an immediate problem with the abolition of duty-free sales. I know that the Financial Secretary takes pride in her preparation for the Committee, so will she tell us how much revenue will be affected by the abolition of duty-free sales?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course one cannot say—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says "Oh", but if he had had enough time to carry out his research, he would have discovered that the revenue cannot be predicted because it depends on the role of the ferry companies under the new arrangements. He should ask why the previous Government signed away the duty-free arrangements. The Conservatives talk about the effect that that will have on the industry, but they have left it to this Government to clear up after them. My hon. Friend the Paymaster General has played a remarkable role in that process, together with my right hon. Friends the Chancellor and the Prime Minister. The hon. Gentleman gives no excuse or explanation for the previous Government's decision. I am sure that the industry, which listens to our deliberations, will take his remarks badly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A constituent of mine, who was the head of the accountancy profession in the 1970s, told me that a Treasury official in the previous Labour Government had asked him for his opinion on the loopholes that they were seeking to close, and how much revenue that would raise. My constituent made the point that taxes were so high that the effect of closing loopholes would be to move people from tax avoidance to tax evasion.<br><br>
The problem for the Government is that under the duty-free system, those who objected to paying high levels of duty could, by taking a trip on a ferry, legitimately buy large quantities of duty-free goods. That is a permissive tax system, but one that engages the citizen and ensures that all citizens—from the most upright to those who might be tempted in other ways—stay within the letter of the law.<br><br>
However, now that the duty-free system across the channel is being abolished, there will be those at the margins of society—I am merely being a realist—who will be more tempted than they were in the past to buy smuggled goods that are not subject to duty. That is an unquantifiable problem, which is why I could not give a totally accurate forecast of the effect of our proposal, but I can forecast with confidence that if the Government ignore the issue, as they have done this afternoon, there will be a loss to the Revenue, which will be laid at the Government's door. We gave them fair warning.</span></p>

<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not being present to introduce my new clause. I gather that it was ably introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Obviously it was not—yes, I am sure that it was, because I have every confidence in my hon. Friend.<br><br>
There used to be an advertisement for a certain brand of whisky, which, after last Thursday's results, I shall cannibalise as follows: "Don't be vague, vote for Hague". Perhaps that summarises the spirit behind the new clause.<br><br>
I spoke with some force about tobacco revenue. Cigarette smoking is increasing, duty is being increased and is among the highest in Europe, and smuggling is on the increase, yet total revenue for the Government is falling each year. The same is true with alcohol. I agree entirely with my hon. Friend, on whom I did not wish to cast aspersions because he always speaks with knowledge, clarity and everything else—[<i>Interruption.</i>] There seems to be much mirth on both Opposition and Government Benches this afternoon.<br><br>
I entirely agree with my hon. Friend that taxation in general should be reduced. When we reduced the top rate of tax from 60 to 40 per cent., we found that the total tax take increased. The same is true of almost every area of economic activity. The Government have reduced the rate of corporation tax, and they will find that economic activity in that area will increase. I am all in favour of tax competition, rather than the tax harmonisation on which the Government are so keen. Why on earth should not an individual Government make up their own mind about how much they want to spend, and therefore how much they want to raise, and then, through a cautious and efficient spending programme, reduce the taxation of its citizens?<br><br>
It seems to make sense to me, in introducing the new clause, that the Government should carefully consider the rate of alcohol duty, especially the disparity between the rate of duty on wine—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is not introducing the new clause. The new clause has already been introduced on his behalf, and the motion may be withdrawn only by the hon. Member for Guildford, who moved it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Butterfill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Keeble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cotswold talks about the new clause reducing taxes for the average citizen, but that would not necessarily be its impact. However, he has not explained—in fact, no one has explained—why the Government should spend £3.3 billion on introducing lower prices for beer drinkers. I can think of many better ways of spending £3.3 billion. Will the hon. Gentleman explain that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has touched on the core of the new clause, but she obviously has not understood what it is all about. First, it would not require the Government to spend that amount. Secondly, I am sure that she would prefer the jobs in manufacturing, distribution and retailing to remain in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 718</span>
this country, instead of going abroad while bootleg beer is re-imported.<br><br>
The disparity with the duty on wine is huge. In France, the duty on a case of wine is less than 50p, but is about £11 in this country. The incentive for smuggling is huge, and the Government will have to do something about it. They cannot bury their head in the sand and say that a little smuggling here and a little bootlegging there does not matter. Increasingly, this country is losing jobs and economic activity, and the Government should pay attention to the matter.<br><br>
I do not want to go over the ground that we covered during the tobacco debate, but I want to return to enforcement. Will the Government clarify their thinking since we discussed tobacco revenue and resources for Customs and Excise? A clearer enforcement policy is needed and reducing the resources of Customs and Excise, as well as reducing its staff by more than 1,000, is folly. We should be considering how to stop bootlegging.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I had a similar exchange at the very beginning of our proceedings, when we discussed smuggling and resources. I understand what he is saying, but the Government have provided additional front-line resources to tackle smuggling, and those are bearing fruit. It is important that Members of the House congratulate and encourage Customs officials in their fight against smugglers. The hon. Gentleman must get his facts right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Until the final barb in the Economic Secretary's comment, I was in agreement with her. It is incumbent on all of us to pay tribute to the hard work, often in difficult and unpleasant circumstances, of Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. But the plain fact is that its resources are being cut. The Economic Secretary may be adding 100 posts to front-line enforcement, but staff numbers behind the scenes will be cut by more than 1,000.<br><br>
The Economic Secretary may argue that Customs and Excise can make efficiency savings and do without those 1,000 posts, but that is a large number of posts to remove over the next three years. Will the hon. Lady assure the Committee that there will be no diminution in the effectiveness of Customs and Excise on the front line, and that there will be increased efficiency?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's comments, and they will also be appreciated by the officials of Customs and Excise. It is important that they receive a strong message from all hon. Members that we appreciate what they are doing. The hon. Gentleman was absolutely right to refer to the difficult and often dangerous circumstances in which the men and women of Customs and Excise work on our behalf. I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks, but it would be helpful if he would acknowledge that we have provided additional resources totalling £35 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for clarifying that; perhaps she will write to the Committee and clarify the matter further. At a recent Public Accounts Committee hearing we heard from the chairman of Customs and Excise, no less,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0405">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 719</span>
that more than 1,000 staff had been lost in the past two years, and that another 1,000 staff would be lost over the next three years. If that is not the case, will the Financial Secretary deny it now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be delighted to write to the hon. Gentleman and copy the letter to the Committee. Although we began our consideration of the Bill some time ago, I have a feeling that I informed the Committee about the difference that had been made by the new resources that we provided. I shall do so again now. In 1998–99, the tax value of detections was £150 million, out of which excise verification officers were responsible for £110 million. That figure had increased from £76 million in the previous year, and the figure for anti-smuggling teams was £30 million. Over the same period, Customs investigators prevented revenue invasion of approximately £986 million. Although those are very good figures, we will not rest on our laurels, as we want to do even better. I mention those figures because it is important to celebrate the success of Customs, and to provide the Committee with as much information as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree that Customs does a splendid job, but it needs help from the Government. The more the Government increase tobacco and alcohol duties, the more smuggling will increase, and, as smuggling increases, Customs and Excise will have a more difficult job. It may detect more smuggled goods, but if the total smuggling rate increases, so will the detection rate. The point is that we should try to reduce the total amount of smuggling, and not allow it to increase.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument closely. Apart from the overall argument about giving into crime—I do not mean to suggest that that is the hon. Gentleman's intention—how, if such a correlation exists, does he explain what happens in Italy and Spain, which have much lower duty rates, but suffer horrendous smuggling problems?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that we must encourage a culture in which people buy goods in this country instead of doing so in other lower-duty countries and then smuggling them in. That is a twofold process. We must encourage a culture in which smugglers are more likely to be caught—which is why Customs and Excise needs more resources—and we must ensure that people can get good value in this country, which will deter them from going to other countries and smuggling goods in. The Financial Secretary looks a little quizzical.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mohammad Sarwar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that under the previous Government the smuggling of beer, wine and spirits peaked? My experience as a wholesaler was that legitimate businesses were in real danger of shedding jobs and of going bust. Over the past two years, the situation has improved tremendously because of Government incentives and the hard work of Customs and Excise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Things may not have got a great deal worse with regard to alcohol, but they certainly have with regard to cigarette smuggling. The figures are clear—£500 million worth of cigarettes were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 720</span>
smuggled two years ago, £1 billion last year and £1.5 billion this year. Those are very large numbers. In this country, one in six of the cigarettes smoked, and 75 per cent, of hand-rolled tobacco, is now smuggled. The situation is beginning to get out of control. The Government will have to treat that issue seriously, and consider reducing rates of duty on alcohol and cigarettes.<br><br>
I hope that the Labour party will start to believe in lower taxation and the market economy. I hope that it will adopt a new slogan—not the third way, but the market way. If it does not, perhaps the British electorate will deliver its verdict, and we will not have new Labour in government, but new Conservatives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For generations, my family has resided on the Cornish coast, which is no stranger to smuggling. I have been imbued from an early age with great respect for Her Majesty's Customs and Excise.<br><br>
Ministers had the good grace to accept in full some amendments that I tabled at an earlier sitting. With equally good grace, I accept the Minister's firm assurances that Customs and Excise now have the power, authority, equipment and resources necessary to prevent an increase in smuggling. On that note, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>

REPAYMENT OF DIVIDEND TAX CREDIT TO NON-TAXPAYERS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'Section 30(5)(b) of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1997 shall cease to have effect.'.—[<i>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
One of the features of this part of the Bill is that we skip dramatically between subjects when dealing with new clauses. We discussed at great length the serious issue of smuggling and we now come to an equally serious matter, the taxation of the savings of the lowest income groups.<br><br>
We tabled the new clause to correct an evident and continuing injustice—the deliberate withdrawal of dividend tax credits from non-taxpayers. Hon. Members will know that dividend tax credits arise from the corporation tax that companies pay on their dividend distributions. The taxpayer is allowed to set part of that corporation tax against his or her tax liability. In the case of non-taxpayers, it is refunded.<br><br>
I put all that in the present tense, but the Government have changed the rules. Although they have compensated higher income taxpayers, they have done nothing to help those who do not pay tax. We are not talking about a few isolated victims of Labour tax policy, but about 630,000 people, nearly half of whom are taxpayers.<br><br>
In their first 1997 Budget, which was guillotined through in a great rush, the Government attacked savings overall through their £5 billion-a-year raid on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0406">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 721</span>
pension funds, which will not be forgotten. They also signalled a damaging change in the taxation of individual savers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Keeble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of detail, the right hon. Gentleman cited a figure of 650,000. In all the previous extensive debates and discussions on the issue, the figure cited was 300,000 and the cost was £75. The previous proposal that the right hon. Gentleman's party made would have saved only half of that. Will he confirm those figures?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The 300,000 figure to which the hon. Lady refers is for the pensioners concerned. I said that nearly half of the total were pensioners, which corresponds with the overall figure of 630,000 taxpayers who are affected. This is, therefore, no small matter.<br><br>
The Government halved the rate of divided tax credit for individual taxpayers, but ensured that they would be fully compensated through consequential changes in the tax system. They refused, however, to do anything for the poor. That move caused great consternation and alarm when it was first signalled two years ago, to the extent that we all thought that the Government had made a genuine mistake. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton first raised the alarm over the issue and mobilised support from outside lobby interests and among hon. Members on both sides of the House to get the matter considered again. Last year, in the Committee considering the Finance Bill, we complained from time to time that Labour Members seemed reluctant to engage on the subject matter under discussion. That was how the sobriquet of nodding donkeys came to stick for a while.<br><br>
It was unfair to have applied that sobriquet on this issue because several Labour Members expressed concerns and extracted from the then Paymaster General—the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson)—a promise that the matter would be reviewed. On Report, the then Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are looking at alternatives".</p></blockquote>
He went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am aware also of growing anxiety among poorer non-taxpayers who have been hit by the measure".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 30 June 1998; Vol. 315, c. 175.]</p></blockquote>
He conceded that the measure was damaging and said that something would be done about it; I do not know his motive. I crossed swords with him on many occasions. Perhaps he was embarrassed by his own offshore tax-sheltering arrangements, and the contrast between those arrangements and the targeted withdrawal of tax support from low-income groups. To be fair to him, I should point out that he agreed to look again at the matter.<br><br>
We were amazed and extremely disappointed when the present Paymaster General, the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo), who is unfortunately not in Committee this afternoon, refused to take forward the review. She announced that poorer pensioners and other savers would be so hit. The measure was not generally damaging for all
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 722</span>
savers—it was targeted and means-tested specifically at the very poor. By definition, the poorest savers pay no tax; however, they are the people who, from April, will not have been receiving repayment of those tax credits. Their richer neighbours and fellow savers will be compensated. If that is new Labour in action, we have all been warned.<br><br>
In Committee this year, no Labour Member has stood up for the disadvantaged in any way. I speculate that that may be one reason why their constituency supporters do not vote for them—it was said by several of last week's failed European election candidates that that was because the Labour party was losing touch with its traditional supporters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that that attitude is spreading through the ranks of Ministers? The Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) made the same point with regard to Wales—that the Labour party was losing touch with its traditional supporters and concerns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes—that is a problem for the Labour party but not for the Conservatives. My friendly advice to Labour Members would be that they should stop abusing the electors and calling them extremists when they do not go out to vote for the Government's European policies.<br><br>
The problem for the Committee this afternoon is that the issue is a national one—that is why it is engaging Opposition Members. We want something to be done about it. The only advice proffered by the Government in recent months has been that these savers should switch their investments into individual savings accounts—ISAs.<br><br>
There are problems with that advice: if they follow it, they will almost certainly find that the charges for taking up such an alternative investment will far outweigh the tax advantages of so doing. The more profound point is that the Government's advice is based on a complete misunderstanding of the people about whom we are talking. They are not sophisticated investors used to taking advice and to switching their investments from shares into building societies or PEPs and TESSAs. They may have, for example, inherited a handful of privatisation shares on the death of a husband and keep those shares as a small contribution to their standard of living in retirement, only for the Government deliberately to remove that £70, £80 or £100—perhaps more—of sheltered revenue, on which the person was relying. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has raised the matter on many occasions: we have had debates in the House of Commons about it. This represents a last chance for the Government to recognise the mistake that they have made. The cost is not great—it is £25 million, as the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) said. When that is against the £5 billion a year that the Government are getting from the withdrawal of dividend tax credits on pension funds, one can see the mean-minded attitude of new Labour when it confronts this section of the saving public.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is making a serious point, and I am following his argument carefully. Does he agree that the Government have mounted a cruel assault on some of the poorest savers in the country? In last year's budget, they withdrew the dividend tax credit to those non-taxpayers; under this year's Budget, savers who have become slightly better off as a result of prudent saving are being hit by the fact that the lower 10p tax rate will not apply to savings They are going to be hit with the whammy of having immediately to move from not having their dividend tax credit into a 20p rate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to allude to that. A macroeconomic problem is developing, because the Government are undermining the savings culture. They talk a lot, as they always do, about self-reliance and persuading people to save and build up assets for their old age. However, in practice their tax measures are undermining the very people who seek to get themselves off dependency on the state and build up something on which they can rely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Keeble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Government are undermining the savings culture, can the right hon. Gentleman explain why ISAs have been so successful? Contrary to all the Opposition's predictions, it is recognised in the industry that they have succeeded in encouraging savers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has reminded the Committee of another Government stupidity. They abolished PEPs and TESSAs—the two most successful savings vehicles of all time, which were respected, understood and fully established—and replaced them with the wholly unknown and untried ISAs, which so far have been very unsuccessful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did my right hon. Friend read in last Sunday's edition of <i>The Sunday Times</i> a clearly worded article that stated that the Inland Revenue has been having discussions with the savings industry about proposals to modify ISAs because they are too complicated and not particularly attractive?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I did see that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that right hon. and hon. Members will not be tempted to turn this into a debate about PEPs, TESSAs and ISAs. We are dealing with a specific area of taxation, and I would be grateful if we could return to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can wrap up this part of the debate by observing—partly in response to the hon. Member for Northampton, North—that the savings ratio is in fact falling. That contradicts her point that ISAs are in any sense a successful replacement. The Government are seriously undermining savings in this country, and the new clause addresses the fact that they are doing so in a way that is deliberately targeted at the poor. I have already observed that there is an electoral reckoning coming for the Labour party. That is its tragedy, but the tragedy for the people about whom I am concerned is that they will have to endure more years in which their modest incomes are undermined by a wholly unjustified attack on them through a change in the tax system. The new clause would remedy that.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 724</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Cable</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall say a few words in support of the new clause; my hon. Friends and I identify with it.<br><br>
Remarkably in this Parliament, this issue has invited a broad all-party coalition. There are one or two smiles appearing on the faces of Labour Members. Should they be doubtful, I suggest that they read the early-day motion, which received roughly equal support from the three political groups and commentary in the Opposition debate in January. During that debate, the hon. Member for Knowsley, South (Mr. O'Hara), the chairman of the all-party group on older people, made a brave statement on the concerns of the lobby for the elderly—including those expressed by Age Concern—about the impact of the Bill.<br><br>
Those of us involved in that campaign have tried to keep it on an all-party basis. The Government's handling of the matter has a lot to do with its continuing difficulty with it. That is quite apart from the substance of the matter. The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) described some of the measure's chronology. Perhaps we should remind ourselves of other elements that are involved.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
We have been told how the matter surfaced in the Finance and Services Committee last year. Following that, the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), who was then Paymaster General, made a gracious concession, having realised that there was a problem and that some poor people were being hit by the measure. He examined the measure, with the support of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.<br><br>
I subsequently talked to the then Paymaster General and his officials, along with the present Solicitor-General. At that point, there was an understanding that the Treasury would set up a working group to explore how to deal with the problem. The matter was seen as an anomaly which the Inland Revenue and the Treasury could potentially resolve.<br><br>
An extraordinary lapse of time then occurred which none of us involved in the matter could understand. I, along with colleagues from all parties, tabled a long stream of parliamentary questions, asking what was happening at the Treasury. Six months later, after questions to the Prime Minister and others at all levels of government, I finally got a written answer, saying, rather bluntly, that the matter was closed and that nothing could be done. No explanation was given.<br><br>
How the decision was taken and the lack of sensitivity to the group involved contributed to considerable resentment of the decision. The time lapse and the presentation of the arguments were also aggravating factors.<br><br>
The Government would have managed the matter successfully if, having examined it, they had said that they recognised that major reform of corporation tax—about which the advance corporation tax people have different views—has the unfortunate by-product of causing injury to non-taxpaying pensioners. The Government ought to have expressed regret about that, and explained that it was part of a bigger reform
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0408">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 725</span>
and that it was impossible to solve the problem administratively.<br><br>
Had the Government done that, the Ministers involved may have won some respect. However, they did not, and tried to justify their action on all kinds of grounds, explaining that 600,000 non-taxpayers and 300,000 pensioners were contributing to re-investment in British industry.<br><br>
The revenue argument has been deployed repeatedly. I asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Select Committee on the Treasury why the Government made their decision. He said that the provision was a revenue measure; he did not say that it had anything to do with administrative problems. The matter involves £25 million; indeed, rather less than that, if some savers have taken the Government's advice and switched their assets into ISAs. However, £25 million is the maximum, and the Government's justification is based on that.<br><br>
The handling of the matter, the language that was used and the lack of humility have contributed to the Treasury's difficulties. That is why the problem has returned this year and why it will return in future.<br><br>
May I add another comment in support of the right hon. Member for Wells? There has been a continuous lack of understanding about the sort of people with whom we are dealing The majority—widows and others—have a few shares as a supplement to their income on top of their state pension but there is another group of non-tax-paying pensioners for whom this is a much more important issue. Ministers fail to appreciate that it is possible to be poor yet reliant on investment income.<br><br>
Let me cite an example of some constituents who came to me a few weeks ago. It is an extreme case, but it illustrates the point. This couple had no state pension because, having worked in the entertainment business, they had not paid contributions. Their incomes had gone up and down; like many such people, they were not entitled to a pension. They provided for their old age by acquiring a portfolio of shares. It must have been quite substantial, but their total income arising is £80 a week. On the Government's estimates of yields, they have £100,000, perhaps a little less, but that is way in excess of what they would require to qualify for income support.<br><br>
Those are very poor people, with incomes way below income support levels, who operate at the sort of income level that the Government think is appropriate for asylum seekers. They have no pension and no income support: they are entirely— or largely, as they may have some income from interest as well—dependent on dividend income. They will be harshly hit by this measure.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Wells has already summarised the key arguments for why the measure is unjust and unfair, and I shall not rehearse them. I refer hon. Members again to some of the speeches made by their own colleagues. I hope that the all-party consensus on this matter will continue to hold. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 726</span>
hon. Member for Knowsley, South reiterated the two central problems that were created by the change and explained why they led to a fundamental sense of unfairness. As a result of the changes, taxpayers had their interests protected and the Government went to considerable lengths to protect the interests of higher-rate tax payers through changes in savings taxation. Yet the particular group to which I refer was isolated.<br><br>
The Government also advised people to shift from shares into ISAs, but that was impractical because of the combination of management fees and set-up costs, which far outweigh any saving from trying to offset the loss of the dividend tax credit. Those problems have never been addressed and I hope that Ministers will acknowledge that, irrespective of party-political factors, people and lobby groups representing all parties are angry about how this matter has been handled. Many hope that this year the Government will suggest how to mitigate the damage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Twickenham has reminded the Committee that many people in our society are poor not because they are feckless but precisely because they tried to provide for their own futures. The extension of means testing by the Government is not only an inadequate answer to the problems of the welfare state, but a con trick against many people who have tried hard to provide for their own future. It is also a con trick on future taxpayers because the benefits bill will nevertheless rise.<br><br>
The measure may not cost £25 million a year. We have heard the defence from Ministers that people can switch to other forms of investment—to bond-type investments that yield interest but are not subject to any withholding of tax. The difficulty is that people are living longer and longer, and bond investments do not grow in value. Those who have savings depend on investments that can grow and that produce dividends, not interest. It is a con trick to tell savers to switch to forms of investment that will not enable them in the long run to provide for their own needs, which is all that those people are trying to do.<br><br>
It was estimated that the average cost of the measure will be £75 per person, which is equivalent to a whole week's pension. As we heard, some of them do not have a pension, so it seems a particularly cruel trick to play on them. Moreover, we should compare and contrast the treatment being meted out to this group of people with that meted out to the charity sector, which will suffer enough at the hands of the Government. I declare an interest as a member of the National Trust, which will suffer a loss in income of £5 million a year as a result of the phasing out of income tax credit. Even a phasing-out period will be of some benefit to the 300,000 old-age pensioners who have been hit by the measure since April of this year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that many churches will be so affected? The Church of England will lose £12 million, and provision would also threaten the ability of its new pension fund to meet its future obligations. For the Church of England, read also the Methodist and Roman Catholic Churches. Does not my hon. Friend feel the hand of the Chancellor on the church collecting plate?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 727</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could not have put that point better myself. I hope that it will give Ministers further pause for thought. Some of the 300,000 people are retired vicars and rectors, who knew that the church pension scheme needed revision and tried again to make some provision for their retirement. Those people never had high incomes, yet their small savings are being penalised by the Government. We had a few sops in the debate from some Labour Members last year. The hon. and learned Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) was particularly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 728</span>
sympathetic to the problem. He has since become Solicitor-General; I suppose that his opposition to the measure was mitigated by thoughts of other rewards. As our reward, we want the Government finally to listen to our views and take some action, which will cost them little but will mean a great deal to those affected.</span></p>
