	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 201, in page 84, line 8, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2) This clause will not come into effect until a referendum on Britain's participation in Economic and Monetary Union has been held.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am about to switch off my mobile phone, I hope that other hon. Members will take the lead from my example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure you, Mr. Cook, that my mobile phone is switched off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause relates to powers requested by the Government for the Commissioners of Inland Revenue and of Customs and Excise to engage in expenditure in preparing for Britain to join the single currency, the third stage of economic and monetary union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Gardiner 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I am sorry to disturb the Committee's proceedings, but the air conditioning is extremely loud and it is difficult to hear the hon. Gentleman. Could the air conditioning be switched off—[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]—or could the hon. Gentleman speak more loudly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members will readily appreciate the dilemma with which we are faced. Either we tolerate the conditions of a sauna bath or we ask the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) to raise his voice a little. Perhaps I may ask the hon. Gentleman to do the second.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to oblige the hon. Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner) by speaking more loudly, slowly and clearly than has been my custom in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eccles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Say something sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot promise the hon. Gentleman that I will say something sensible, but I shall endeavour to make myself heard, sensible or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This important clause relates to the wish of Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue to spend money preparing for Britain to join the single currency. It is not about the Government spending public money catering for the situation in which the country has found itself since 1 January this year, as part of a European Union in which most of the other countries have joined the single currency. No Opposition Member would object to expenditure
	<span class='label label-info column'>648</span>
being spent on preparing for something that has happened; that would be absurd. We recommend that not only the public sector but the private sector prepare for the situation in which most of the continental countries that are members of the European Union have this new currency called the euro, which, as far as this country is concerned, is another foreign currency. The Government and the private sector must change their systems, forms and other arrangements to take into account the existence of the new reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the clause does not relate to that situation. It is about preparing for something that has not happened. It is part and parcel of—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gardiner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman inform the Committee how it is possible to prepare for something that has happened? I thought that the whole point of preparing for something was that that something had not happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. However—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] There is a "however". One cannot prepare for something if it has already happened, and this country did prepare in advance for the situation in which the other European countries would move towards European union. We knew that that would happen; the laws had been passed. It was not ultra vires, but legitimate for Britain, in advance of 1 January this year, to prepare for other countries in the European Union joining the single currency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald	<div class='memberconstituency'> (North-East Hertfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that there is still something that has not happened? The Government have not committed themselves to Britain's going ahead and joining the euro. Therefore to spend money on preparations for that eventuality would be wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point, and I shall deal with it shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the point that the hon. Member for Brent, North made, yes, one has to prepare for something in advance, but the legal formalities, which are always completed in advance of something happening, should be completed early enough to enable preparation in advance of the event to take place. That is precisely what happened on the continent of Europe with regard to European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Kingston and Surbiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to argue that one does not make preparations in advance of something that one is not certain will happen. If that were the case, most investment in the private sector would not take place. Private sector companies have to take risks and prepare for possibilities that may give them huge benefits, it is right for this country to make preparations in advance, so that if the people vote for the single currency, the country will be able to benefit greatly from monetary union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. The private sector assesses the likelihood of an event occurring in the future and, on the basis of that risk assessment, will invest its clients' or its own money. What would a risk assessment of whether Britain
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>649</span>
should join the European Union say? All the opinion polls suggest that two out of three people in this country are opposed to Britain's joining the single currency. For Britain to join, the Labour party must win a general election, which is not a foregone conclusion. Despite the arrogance of many Labour Members, last week's elections make it clear that they can no longer be certain that they will win the next general election. On top of that, they must win a vote in the House of Commons and in Cabinet, and must then win a referendum. On the balance of probabilities, that set of events is unlikely to occur. If it were a private sector decision, the investment would probably not be made, because it would be unlikely to come to fruition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colne Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are to judge the balance of probabilities, surely we must look at history and see what went before. When we went into the Common Market, 70 per cent, of the public were against it, albeit there was proper debate, and that situation clearly changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go into the history of the European Union, but there are significant differences between the referendum on Britain remaining in the European Community in 1975 and the situation today. Had I been old enough to vote in 1975—[HON. MEMBERS: "Aaah."] I was just trying to rub in the age of some Labour Members—that does not include the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie). Had I voted in 1975,1 should certainly have voted for Britain to be in the European Union. Conservative Members are very supportive of the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1975 most of the newspapers, the two main political parties and even the Liberal party were all in favour of Britain joining the European Union. Today the issue is about the single currency. The policy of one of the main political parties is that an incoming Conservative Government will not take Britain into a single currency in the lifetime of that Parliament, and most of our major newspapers are not in favour of Britain joining the single currency. Therefore the situation now is different from that of 1975.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Leslie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Shipley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us get it right. Surely the Conservative party wants to keep open the option of joining the euro.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Conservative party's policy is clear: an incoming Conservative Government will not take Britain into a single currency. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I was asked about our policy at the election after next. Conservative party policy on this issue, as on many issues, will be decided at the time of that election. The hon. Member for Shipley cannot tell me what the Labour party's policy on taxation will be at the election after next, and the Government have not even kept the promises on taxation that they made at the last election. What will their policy be at the election after next?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we have just heard is amazing. At stake is whether we have a sensible Government who approach the issue sensibly by making preparations, or whether we adopt the
	<span class='label label-info column'>650</span>
appalling approach of the Opposition. Although the Conservative party's policy might be that we shall not join the euro after the next election, or even the election after that, the hon. Gentleman has not said that the Conservative party would never join the euro. The Conservatives have not ruled that out. Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that he would rule out joining the euro at any stage, or does he want to keep his options open?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, the position is clear. If it is elected at the next general election, the Conservative party has ruled out Britain joining a single currency in the lifetime of the next Government. What its policy will be at the following election will be determined at the time when manifesto preparations are made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the important issue is the Government's policy on joining the euro. After last Thursday's election results, I wonder whether their strong policy in favour of joining in principle will be changed in the near future and replaced by another form of words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. The elections that we fought hard, and Labour Members fought with less alacrity, made it clear that the British public are opposed to Britain's joining a single currency. That will be the Conservative party's policy at the next general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman concede that the Conservative party could at some time in the future join the single currency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the balance of probabilities, that seems unlikely. However, the Conservative party is not ruling any option out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Opposition are considering joining the single currency at some time in the future, will they prepare for that possibility and allocate money to it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has come to the crux of the amendment and of the debate. The answer is no. It is wrong in principle for a Government to commit taxpayers' money to a project that does that have the authority of Parliament, the Cabinet or the British people for expenditure to be made. [HON. MEMBERS: "What about the Bill?"] No, the clause before us would give the Government the legal but not the moral authority to do that. They are committing expenditure to a project that the British people and Parliament have not approved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend not agree that one of the genuinely shocking things about the Government's approach is that they do not have the courage of their convictions to stand up and argue for the euro, despite the fact that they require taxpayers and companies all over the country to spend huge sums of money preparing for it? They are trying to create conditions in which it will slip in as an inevitable item, although it should be considered as an important matter of principle and economic policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. It is astonishing that the Prime Minister, who is allegedly in favour of Britain joining the single currency, is not prepared to explain the policy on the stump throughout the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0369">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>651</span>
country, so that he can convince the public of his way of thinking. He is committing tens of millions of pounds of public money to the project. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) pointed out, he is urging and exhorting private sector companies to spend billions of pounds of their own money to prepare for something that, on the balance of probabilities, is unlikely to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has some skills in accountancy. Would he advise private companies not to allocate money to prepare for the euro?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to advise private companies how to spend their money. However, directors of private companies are custodians of shareholders' money and have an obligation to ensure that they perform their fiduciary duty well and without breach of trust. It may be questionable for private companies to commit themselves to expenditure when the balance of probabilities is that that expenditure would be wasted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have not the vast majority of companies prepared already? It is sensible to make plans if we are to do business in Europe. Many companies are already doing so, as that is good for business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is wrong. Most companies are not spending billions of pounds preparing for that eventuality. Companies that have to replace equipment for other purposes, when there is no significant additional margin of cost involved in preparing for Britain's joining the euro, may make preparations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman withdraw that statement? My hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) did not mention billions of pounds or any other amount of money. She talked about the principle of the matter and good business sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misunderstands the matter. The hon. Member for Colne Valley said that most companies were preparing to join Europe. They are not, as doing so would cost most of them billions of pounds. The British private sector is not spending billions of pounds preparing for Britain to join the single currency, so the hon. Lady is clearly wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that the euro is already Europe's business currency? Fifty per cent, of our trade is with Europe, so obviously, companies trading with Europe must deal with the euro. Therefore business is already playing the game in Europe and is investing more and more. The hon. Gentleman is out of step with history; once again, he has adopted a completely untenable position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not right about that, either. A lot of trade is conducted in dollars and in many other currencies. However, we have no objection to British companies preparing for the existing state of affairs. [HON. MEMBERS: "Ah."] Of course the Government and British companies,
	<span class='label label-info column'>652</span>
especially those dealing with Europe, should prepare for a new foreign currency called the euro. That is only proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause concerns spending taxpayers' money on Britain joining the single currency, abolishing sterling and establishing the euro as our new currency—but Britain joining the single currency is not in the law, nor have the British Government made an absolute unequivocal commitment to joining the single currency; a whole host of caveats remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause requires Parliament to approve expenditure for a matter that has not received Government approval. All the opinion polls suggest that an overwhelming majority of the public opposes Britain's joining the single currency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman speculate on whether the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) also opposes the idea? [HON. MEMBERS: "Where is he?"] The right hon. Gentleman is not in Committee today. I would be seriously worried if there were a split in the Conservative Opposition today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has his own opinion, which he may disclose should he wish to do so. The hon. Gentleman should give his opinion of the single currency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have a problem. The noise of the air conditioning is a problem for Committee Members, and that problem is increased by a factor of five in relation to the recording of our proceedings. It is important both that our proceedings are in order and that they are properly recorded. A collective haranguing makes matters more difficult. I must be able to hear and, more importantly, so must the Committee Sub-Editor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to quell the Committee's good spirits and humour, but let us proceed sensibly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. Can you advise me whether, in the absence of the senior Opposition Front Bench spokesman, who has done a runner today, the Opposition are quorate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman ought to know—but if he does not I am happy to advise him—that the quorum relates to the Committee as a whole, not to factions within it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Cook. It would be interesting to hear the opinions of Opposition Members on Britain's joining the single currency. Their opinions could then be relayed to their local newspapers, and that would have an important effect at a subsequent general election if they stood for reelection. Opinion polls show that the overwhelming majority of people are against our joining the single currency. In our view, a referendum should have been held before we were asked to approve clause 121, before any public expenditure was committed to preparing the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is a bit rich of Labour Members to criticise the attendance of Opposition members of the Committee, when the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey) admitted that he could not have made a certain speech

in Committee because he was spending a week in Greece at the time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Borrow 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ribble)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to tease out something that the Opposition spokesman said earlier this morning. I understood him to say that Opposition Members are not in principle opposed to a single currency, but that they have ruled it out for the lifetime of the next Parliament. If at the end of the next Parliament they decided that it would be in Britain's interest to be part of the single currency, I presume that one consideration for them would be the economic advantages accruing to the United Kingdom from membership. In that case, surely it would make sense for measures to be taken before Britain decided whether to join, to ensure that we were economically prepared to become part of the single currency. Alternatively, we might decide in principle to join because it would be in our interest, only to discover that the economy was not prepared for it, so it would be to this country's disadvantage. Can the hon. Gentleman comment on the possibility of the Opposition, if they were in Government, introducing a measure that would help to prepare our economy for membership before deciding whether it would be in Britain's economic interest to join?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Down that road madness lies. Many policies could be adopted in five years' time. It would be absurd to say that Britain should prepare now for all those possible policies. We must prepare for decisions that on balance of probabilities, are likely to be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for spending money on projects, each project would need Parliament's authority before that could happen. As the hon. Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow) and his hon. Friends appear so keen for expenditure to be incurred now, they should table a motion in the House proposing that Britain join the single currency on a certain date following the general election, and hold a referendum. We should not commit ourselves to expenditure before those things have been done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that the Government's position is different from that of the Opposition, in that we would join the single currency as soon as it was in Britain's interest to do so? The hon. Gentleman's position is clearly different: for him it is irrelevant whether joining would be in Britain's interest. Surely it is wise to prepare and to be timely. The hon. Gentleman does not take that view; the Government do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's position is slightly firmer than that. They have ruled out any consideration of the constitutional objections to Britain joining the single currency. They have said that they will rely solely on the economic tests that they have set themselves. As for the constitutional implications, they regard them as no hindrance to Britain's joining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>654</span>
There are both constitutional and economic arguments against Britain joining the single currency, and on balance, British public opinion is against it more on constitutional than on economic grounds. However, the strong economic arguments against joining have not been addressed by Government Members, and until they are, British public opinion will not change significantly. Furthermore, unless public opinion does change, it would not be right for the Committee to pass clause 121 unamended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether my hon. Friend has received, as I have, correspondence from constituents concerned about Government expenditure on this matter. Any presentation in favour of joining the euro should be balanced by an acknowledgement of the disadvantages. Will my hon. Friend press the Government to ensure that expenditure is fairly applied?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Those issues are dealt with in the Neill report on referendums, and it is important that the Government adhere to what is set out there. We will debate a new clause on the report's recommendations later. My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and it is crucial to hold a referendum on the single currency before the clause takes effect. Until such a referendum produces an affirmative response, we should not commit public money to this project—and that cannot happen unless Government Members address the economic arguments against the single currency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mohammad Sarwar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are not ruling out the single currency, which means that there is a possibility of our joining it in future. However, the argument of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is never to join the single currency. Why will Conservative Members not come clean and say that they will never join it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because that is not the policy. Conservative party policy is pragmatic. We believe, on both constitutional and economic grounds, that joining the single currency would not be in Britain's interest. We do not claim to be the fountain of all knowledge. Our arguments may not hold water, so our policy is to see the single currency working in Europe—in good times and bad—in order to decide whether our arguments are valid. For example, would the constitutional implications of Britain joining the single currency involve the loss of control over our economic and tax policies? If we are right, we should not join; if we are wrong, we should reconsider the issue. That is our policy—pragmatic and, I believe, right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the purpose of clarity—I am losing the thread of the hon. Gentleman's argument here—may I ask why it is pragmatic to wait another full parliamentary term before the issue is even considered? What is pragmatic about ruling out further examination of the matter for another arbitrary period, simply because that makes a round figure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The decision is not one that can be changed in three or four years' time; it is a one-way decision. That is why the pragmatic approach is to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0371">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>655</span>
watch the single currency working in Europe in good times and in bad. The dogmatic approach adopted by the Government is that there are no objections to the project on constitutional grounds, and only a few tests to pass on economic grounds, before Britain is signed up for good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully accept that it is wise to see how the currency performs, and that would form part of the economic indicators that will be examined before a decision is taken. I still fail to understand why the period, be it five years, seven years, 10 years or whatever, has to be absolute. Why not take the decision when it is in Britain's interest to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We propose no absolute number in terms of years. Our policy is clear: an incoming Conservative Government will not take Britain into the single currency. No years or numbers are mentioned, it is a pragmatic policy and a one-way decision. We need to see the single currency working. Britain is a significant world economy—the fourth largest in the world—and whether this country gives up its own currency is a significant matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gardiner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify what he means by an incoming Conservative Government? The policy may be extremely pragmatic, but there will be no incoming Conservative Government in the next five or 10 years. Will the hon. Gentleman clarify the time scale that he has in mind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The latest "opinion poll", taken last week, shows that there would be an incoming Conservative Government. That is the most significant opinion poll yet—much more significant than MORI or NOP. The hon. Gentleman's arrogant claims that there will not be an incoming Conservative Government are invalid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether the Committee should accept the amendment depends on its response to arguments about the single currency, and about whether one interest rate should apply across the European continent—to Portugal, Germany, France, Britain and the other European countries. If they want to win a referendum, which the amendment would require, Labour Members must say what will happen if, for example, there is a drought in Portugal which leads that country into a recession, but there is no such climatic problem in Britain, which continues to have a growing, or slightly booming, economy. In such circumstances, Britain will require higher interest rates to choke off inflationary pressure, but lower interest rates will be required in Portugal, to drag it out of recession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were a European single currency, there would be only one interest rate, probably an average for the continent. It would inevitably be too high for Portugal and too low for Britain, so Portugal would stay in recession and Britain would go into a spiralling crisis. If Labour Members cannot refute that argument, how do they expect to win a referendum? If they do not expect to win a referendum, what right have they got to accept a clause that commits taxpayers' money to preparing for something that most people are against?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>656</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is confusing me even more. He now seems to be arguing that we should never enter the single European currency; I disagree with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not arguing that we should never enter; I am advancing an argument against a single currency. I may be wrong on these issues—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] I do not claim to be the fount of all knowledge. It would be more helpful if, instead of attacking me, the hon. Lady attacked my argument and asked what would happen in the circumstances that I outlined. I want to see the single currency working in good times and in bad, to see whether her arguments or mine are correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the drought in Portugal, does the hon. Gentleman accept that the interest rates in different parts of Europe are largely determined by the mood of financial markets and not by the economic fundamentals of those different parts of Europe? In the Netherlands, for example, the view is that there is sovereignty for five minutes—the time between the interest rate being set in the Central Bank and the response elsewhere. As Norman Lamont and others know, sovereignty is a facade; it does not really exist. With his background, the hon. Gentleman should know that exchange rates and interest rates are all about mood, movement and international financial markets, not about drought in Portugal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those are the arguments of Professor Buiter, with which I do not agree. Yes, there are many influences on the exchange rate and on interest rates throughout the world, not just in Europe, all of which have an effect on the price of borrowing money. What is clear is that if countries do not have the correct interest rate for their domestic conditions, trouble will brew, as it did when Britain was in the exchange rate mechanism. As the recession deepened, we were forced to have interest rates at 10 per cent., 11 per cent, and 12 per cent. We learnt lessons then, and it is important that the hon. Gentleman should learn them, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gardiner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman reflect on what he has said and admit that Britain suffered so acutely at that time, and had to rush headlong out of the exchange rate mechanism, because of the unrealistic rate of DM2.95 at which the Conservative Government joined? That was unsustainable—all the markets knew that. Ultimately, the market forced the ejection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point. At whatever rate one joins such projects, it will always be wrong at some point. One can never assess the correct rate. Even today, many commentators in Germany claim that Germany went into the single currency at the wrong rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Guildford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Employment Sub-Committee recently took evidence from the Governor and Deputy Governor of the Bank of England on the employment consequences of European monetary union. Professor King, the Deputy Governor, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is impossible to know what is too high a rate or what is too low a rate."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0372">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>657</span>
He and the Governor explicitly said that it was impossible to tell whether the rate was right for joining the single currency. That is devastating evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. He has presented the essence of the case. As a famous lady once said, "You can't buck the market." Anyone who tries to buck the market gets into serious difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The business cycle constitutes the second key economic argument against joining the single currency. Being at the wrong stage of the business cycle compounds the difficulties of having the same interest rate. Whether we like it or not, Britain has historically been on a different business cycle from that of continental Europe. We tend to follow the United States' business cycle. I do not know why; perhaps it is because we speak the same language, watch the same television programmes and share cultural links. Unless Labour Members can be sure that Britain's business cycle will converge permanently with that of Europe, they will commit this country to having the wrong interest rates for all time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the case is so bad, why does the Conservative party keep open the option of joining the euro?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because Conservative Members, unlike Labour Members, are not sufficiently arrogant to be sure that they are right. We may be wrong; we do not know. We want to see the European single currency working in good and bad times to ascertain whether we are right. That means waiting before making such a once-and-for-all decision. We take a pragmatic view, not the dogmatic approach of Labour Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gardiner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the United States. Perhaps he can apply one part of his argument to another, and explain why drought in Portugal would have a negative impact on Britain with its temperate climate whereas drought in Arizona and flooding in Arkansas does not seem to have the same deleterious effect on the United States economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises a good point. Comparisons between the United States and Europe are helpful. If a drought in a state in America plunged its economy into recession, people could move to another state because they speak the same language—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] That happens in the United States. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We seem to have a problem of over-enthusiasm. I remind the Committee that all Members will have an opportunity to express their views through formal interventions—the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has shown a readiness to give way. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] Order. Continued collective haranguing from sedentary positions does not help the reporting of our proceedings. I have appealed to hon. Members before; I now insist that any comments are made in interventions, if the speaker is willing to give way, or through catching my eye and making a sensible comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>658</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the United States, when there is a recession in one part of the economy, people move. Mass work migration occurs throughout the United States because it has one language and one predominant culture. A significant number of Portuguese people work in London, but there is not sufficient movement of the working population to ameliorate pockets of recession throughout Europe. That will not happen until there is one language throughout Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note the enthusiastic massed ranks of Conservative Members in the Committee to support the hon. Gentleman's argument. Is he not developing the argument that we should stay out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, my position is that I have significant concerns about the single currency. There are three major economic arguments, and one major constitutional argument, which no one has yet successfully addressed. I am not sufficiently arrogant to say that I am right. I might be wrong, in which case I would change my mind. I want to see the single currency working in good and bad times, and I want to hear the arguments, which some Opposition Members are now advancing, to decide whether they hold water. We are discussing the future of this country. The debate is about more than a disagreement between the Labour and Conservative parties. The issues are important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman's position were truly pragmatic, I would applaud him—but why do the public believe that his position is to stay out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because our position is to stay out. At the next general election, our policy will be that we shall not take Britain into a single currency. An incoming Conservative Government will not take Britain into the single currency and will not abolish the pound. The public are right to believe that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shall we explore that further? The Conservative party is ruling out entry to the single currency during the current Parliament and the following Parliament. The hon. Gentleman says that he is open to argument and is happy to wait and see—so would he support entry to a successful single currency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have tabled questions to try to discover the meaning of the term, "successful single currency", which is the new cliché from Labour party Headquarters, but I have not been given a satisfactory answer. I cannot reply to the hon. Gentleman's question because I have not been given a definition of a "successful single currency". What criteria does the hon. Gentleman attach to that phrase? For the reasons that I have given, I am concerned that a single currency in Europe will not be good for this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sarwar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman accepts that the position adopted by the Conservative party may be wrong. If British industry and business wanted to join the single currency after two years, what would his position be if his party were in Government? Would industry and business be told they would have to wait because of Conservative party policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether our party changes its policy will depend on what the right policy is. At the moment, we believe that we are right in our view of the single currency, and that there are significant economic reasons for staying out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman said that he did not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We believe that we are right in our view, but we may not be. We are not arrogant, and if we are proved to be categorically wrong, we shall change our policy. It is irrelevant whether one person in society believes that we are wrong. What matters is whether we are wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been generous in giving way, and I am grateful for that. Is his view the united view of his whole team? Does the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) agree with the pragmatic approach, or is he more enthusiastic about staying out? What is the position of the right hon. Member for Charnwood? Is not the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton trying to tread the middle ground between different views in his party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that there is no homogenous view of any issue in British politics; there should be different nuances in all areas and policies. Long may that remain the case in a two-party democracy that relies on there being a variety of views in each political camp. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that his hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford—who, from a sedentary position, seemed to be describing the hon. Gentleman's position as "a bit wet"—would not share his view? From what I have heard, the hon. Gentleman would never contemplate joining the single currency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend was being humorous. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Financial Secretary may find that difficult to understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Whittingdale 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Maldon and East Chelmsford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am enjoying my hon. Friend's speech immensely. He is advancing extremely persuasive arguments, with which I fully agree. Nevertheless, the subject is of such importance that, if you are generous enough to call me, Mr. Cook, I shall make my own contribution to the debate. In doing so, I shall fully support everything that my hon. Friend has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall now move on to the third argument—on exchange rate flexibility—with which Labour members must deal if they want to win the referendum mentioned in the amendment, and if they expect the Committee to vote for the clause. To deal with the comparative advantages and the efficiency differences between countries, we need exchange rate flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us imagine the following circumstance. A toy factory in Greece produces toy cars that cost 1 drachma each, and a toy factory in Germany produces identical cars that cost 1 deutschmark each. At that time, 1 deutschmark equals 1 drachma, so the
	<span class='label label-info column'>660</span>
Greek factory can export its toy cars to Germany, sell them for 1 deutschmark each and compete well with the domestically produced car. But then the Greek factory maintains its efficiency rate, while the German factory doubles its efficiency rate and produces toy cars that cost half a deutschmark each. The exchange rate remains the same, 1 deutschmark equals 1 drachma, and the Greek car continues to cost 1 deutschmark. As a result, no Greek cars are sold in Germany, because the German cars cost half as much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exchange rate should have fallen to reflect the differences in efficiency between the two economies, so that, say, two drachmas equalled 1 deutschmark. Had that happened, despite the doubling of the German factory's efficiency rate, the Greek factory would still have been able to sell its toy cars in Germany for half a deutschmark each. Without such flexibility, there will be pockets of unemployment in relatively less efficient European economies. That is the great danger of fixed exchange rates throughout continental Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have advanced three significant economic arguments on the dangers of Britain's joining the single currency. Until the Government deal with them, they will not win their referendum on this issue. Without that referendum, it is constitutionally wrong for Committee members to commit public money to preparing the Inland Revenue and the Commissioners of Customs and Excise for Britain's joining the single currency. On balance, Britain is unlikely to join, and it would therefore be wrong to waste millions of pounds on such preparations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a constitutional argument against Britain's joining the single currency. Once a country loses control of its interest rates, it loses control of a significant part of its economy. We are already experiencing moves towards the harmonisation of taxation in Europe. There have been clear moves by the code of conduct group, the European Commission and other politicians in Europe who want uniform rates of taxation. They argue that there must not be competing rates between countries in a single market with a single currency, because that would disadvantage business in the countries with higher tax rates. They believe that a region with a single currency would no longer suffer the risk of currency fluctuations, and that business would therefore inevitably flood into the countries with the lowest tax rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, if Britain were to join the single currency, there would be severe pressure for us to harmonise our tax rates with those of the rest of Europe. I believe that that would be damaging, in terms not only of our competitiveness vis-a-vis the rest of the world, but of our constitutional position. The British people have always been able to set their own tax rates. Taxation goes to the heart of democratic government, because most people resent giving up a significant part of their income to the state. Unless they believe that they have control over how much they give, the constitutional settlement of this country will be undermined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the issue of tax harmonisation is separate from the issue of the single currency? He is attempting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0374">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>661</span>
to mix the two together, in saying that if we had a single currency, all tax rates would have to be the same, otherwise they would not be competitive and inward investment would flow out of Britain. He is wrong to introduce that fallacious argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be a separate issue for the hon. Gentleman, but it is not a separate issue for the people in the European Union who have joined the single currency. They passionately believe that countries in a single currency union must have harmonised tax rates, because of the difficulties that I have just described. People are genuinely concerned that it would be impossible to resist the pressure to harmonise our tax rates and tax systems with those on the continent of Europe, if we were to join the single currency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude by saying that unless the Government can address all those arguments, I do not believe that the Committee should pass clause 121 unamended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gardiner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has sprung to life—belatedly, perhaps. This morning's debate is the first in which I have not been tempted to close my eyes at some point during the proceedings—[HON. MEMBERS: "Shame."]—although certainly not when any Member on my own side was speaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the first things that I learned when studying philosophy was that two irreconcilable facts that one does not like are referred to as a contradiction, but that two irreconcilable facts that one does like tend to be called a paradox. The Conservatives need to learn the difference between a contradiction and a paradox. They say that they have no objection to spending money preparing for something that has already happened. That is transparent nonsense. One cannot prepare for something that has already happened; one can only prepare for something that is going to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Heaven help us if the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who spoke with great courage and clarity this morning, should ever become Secretary of State for Defence. He would not believe that it was right to prepare for a thermonuclear war, as that would be in complete contrast to all the principles that he set out. He said that one should not prepare for anything until all the legal formalities had been completed in advance, and until we had committed ourselves to going down that route. One of the features of a thermonuclear war is that those involved do not know in advance whether they will go down that route. Heaven help us if we ever reach a point at which the enemy knows that there is such a commitment. The arguments that he has presented for not preparing this country for an event that has already overtaken Europe—and that will incontrovertibly influence everything that goes on in this country for at least the next generation—do not stack up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's position is somewhat reminiscent of the old Guinness advert—"I don't like it, so I won't prepare it". He challenged Labour Members, and, indeed, the Government, to stand up
	<span class='label label-info column'>662</span>
and argue positively for the euro. There is a good reason not to stand up and make the case for Britain joining the euro now—the Government do not yet believe that it is in Britain's economic interest to do so. The hon. Gentleman was right to refer to interest rates and convergence of economies, and the Chancellor has taken account of those in his criteria for the conditions under which it may be right for Britain to join the euro. We cannot say, "Yes, we should now join". All that we can say is, "If those criteria are met, and it is clearly in Britain's economic interest to join, this Government will do so".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to probe the hon. Gentleman's logic and that of his party. If the Government had said that they would join the euro as soon as it was in Britain's interest to do so, which the hon. Gentleman opposes, the corollary is that the Conservatives want to preclude joining the euro, even if it is in our interest to do so. That does not smack of an Opposition who are ready to listen, open-minded and not adopting an arrogant stance; it smacks of an Opposition who have made up their mind that, at least for a given period, they cannot countenance doing that from which the country might benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman concede that it could conceivably be argued that this country might benefit from adopting the dollar as its currency? A greater proportion of our trade is in dollars than in any other currency. Should we therefore commit millions of pounds to making Customs and Excise computers dollar-compliant, in case such a decision was reached?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gardiner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will forgive me for reminding him that, until an incoming Conservative Government should decide otherwise, we are still members of the European Union. The euro is a project of the European Union, of which we are an integral member, and I believe that even the leader of the Conservative party has said that we should be at the heart of Europe. As we are part of the European project, we must take the euro seriously. It will affect all the other members of the European Union, and it will inevitably affect our economy.

The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton talked about what he implied would become the new West Lothian question—the Portuguese drought question. He asked what the differential effect of events that change the rates in which economies within Europe operate would be if a unified interest rate governed all the different micro-economies. That is a legitimate question, which other economies resolved historically. City states and towns, which were also affected by the distance between them, overcame the problem of having different economies. Newcastle, London and Bristol might have different micro-economies today, but that does not militate against us having a common currency. Indeed, the United States has a common currency in an economy that is as large as that of the EU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>663</span>
in Portugal, the rain in Spain, or whatever, is fatuous. Agriculture in Portugal employs only about 10 per cent, of people. As a drought would be regional, the argument is fallacious. A better example would be the impact of bovine spongiform encephalopathy on United Kingdom exports and employment. The Conservative party knew a little about that when it was in government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gardiner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said that the movement of people in the United States is possible because they share a single language. Is he aware that most people in the United States speak Spanish? American English is the other major language.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gardiner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are almost as many as there are in the United States, which prides itself on having been a melting pot.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gardiner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a telling point. Clearly that is not the case. Although there is the possibility of movement, we do not see masses of people moving within the domestic economy of the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton spoke about exchange rate flexibility and mentioned the example of toy factories in Greece and Germany. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would recognise that that argument was specious. If a factory in one part of the Community makes economies and efficiency savings with the result that its production costs are reduced, it does not mean, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, that it must continue to sell the car for 1 drachma or 1 deutschmark. The whole point is that fixing exchange rates does not mean fixing prices. There is price flexibility even where there is not exchange rate flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>664</span>
Having had 10 years' experience of running a business in the City of London, exporting to other countries and charging fees in other currencies, I can tell the Committee that one of the major problems that I faced, as an exporter, was that the exchange rate costs of doing business with other countries were such that they hampered my business financially. My business was also hampered simply because so much time was consumed each month in looking ahead and thinking about what income I would receive within a certain time period that I needed to hedge against in order to ensure that I did not sustain losses as a result of the European exchange rate mechanism. Business in this country appreciates that the abolition of those exchange rates will be of immeasurable benefit, both to it and to this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton spoke about harmonisation of taxes. All the questions that he raised this morning are entirely proper and warrant a response. He spoke about becoming a haven within a harmonised system, on the basis that whichever country has the lowest tax base will become the centre of productivity. Naturally, business would agglomerate in that area. However, he did not carry the argument through to its logical conclusion. Applying his logic, given that there is already European monetary union and that the rest of Europe has moved in that direction, harmonisation of taxes would naturally follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What, then, for the United Kingdom—one small island off the haven that is the whole of continental Europe? It is not a question of Britain being able to continue in splendid isolation with the pound while the rest of the world remains unchanged and business carries on as usual. The problem that the Conservatives must face up to and prepare for, along with the rest of the country, is that Britain will be isolated from the domain in which business is done. The hon. Gentleman put forward the argument of a haven for business. That haven will be continental Europe, and Britain will not be able to compete within that market unless we make preparations now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vincent Cable	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Twickenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much welcome the fact that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has raised this issue. I am sure that during the latter half of this Parliament, the Conservatives will initiate many more debates about economic and monetary union and Europe in general. They can do that in several ways. It can be done in a sensible and helpful way, or it can be done in a silly fashion. I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's approach to EMU, but a sensible, plausible Eurosceptic argument can be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully acknowledge that economic risks and costs are associated with Britain's membership of EMU and that important constitutional issues should be debated. That is one reason why I am one of the few non-Conservatives to have signed the early-day motion of the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) on constitutional matters. Such points must be debated, and I welcome the spirit in which they have been put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, much of the input has been unhelpful. "Silly" might not be quite the right word to describe it,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>665</span>
but some arguments are not appropriate and the amendment reflects them. This week, we heard the absurd argument about gold sales and the conspiratorial belief that perfectly sensible decisions have been overshadowed by a secret Euro-agenda. In the same category—and whatever one's views about the euro—is the idea that the Government should not engage in contingency planning. That does not help to take the argument forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the contribution of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was based on what he considered to be a prudent, business-like approach to the matter. He said that a prudent business manager would not spend shareholders' money on such exercises. The hon. Gentleman is totally wrong. My experience of business is that that is not the way that big companies operate. Big companies—and not just in the defence sector—often engage in expensive contingency planning. They have scenario plans and different ways of looking at the future, and they spend a lot of their shareholders' money on that. They take out options on future investments, which, on the balance of probabilities, may never materialise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the energy business is spending hundreds of millions of pounds on exploratory investments in Russia. It is probable that it will never invest in Russia. The political conditions or the price of oil may not be right, but it is sensible business to make a preliminary investment. If conditions are right, companies will then be able to do something about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more mundane level, every property developer and council buys bits of land in cities on an option basis. At some time in the future, that land may be useful for a development. They spend money, but they may not follow the project up. However, it is sensible business planning to engage in such preliminary investments and to spend shareholders' money on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman recognises the difference between the private sector risking its own money in ways that it chooses and the Government taking taxpayers' money and spending it for their own political objectives. That is what we are debating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is not the difference that the hon. Gentleman has described. Conservative Members are confusing two different issues. There are two types of planning for the future. The first deals with strategic issues. They include deciding whether we should join the single currency and considering the implications of not being a member or, even, of being linked to the dollar. Any sensible Government should consider such options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second type of planning deals with technical matters. If we join EMU—and we may do—many practical actions will have to be taken in relation to software and equipment. If economic conditions prove to be right and there is a majority verdict in a referendum, it is sensible to prepare the country for making the necessary moves. In that sense, there is no
	<span class='label label-info column'>666</span>
difference between the role of Government and the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a mechanism by which the Opposition and the Government can sensibly consider how we go about such planning. About six months ago, the Chancellor set up an all-party group—I am the only member of the Committee who is part of it—to engage in thinking about how best to proceed. I was disappointed that the Conservatives did not propose someone for what is not a pro-Government or pro-EMU committee. Its Northern Ireland members are anything but pro-EMU. It is a balanced group and the chairman is open minded. At our first meeting, he asked what we wanted to talk about, and what forward planning it would be useful to engage in. It is a great pity that Conservative Members are not part of that process, which is one reason why they have used the arguments that they have advanced about the amendment today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Conservative Members were part of the process, we could be discussing the options in a much more open-ended way, and thinking about contingency planning more sensibly. Even at this late stage, I urge Conservatives to think about participating. If they decided to join the committee and asked the Government to do some preliminary examination of the implications of not joining EMU, I would support them. That is just as much forward planning as is preparing to join. However, unless they are willing to join the process they cannot reasonably complain that they are not part of the decision making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I am critical of the Conservatives' approach, the Government partly have themselves to blame. One valid point made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was that the Government's position is weaker because they have not held a referendum. That is absolutely right. We are talking about water under the bridge, but if the Government had taken the calculated risk of holding a referendum six months after the general election, there is a possibility—not a certainty that we might know where we stood in terms of admission. However, the Government missed that opportunity and we now face unnecessary uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government not doing enough forward thinking on economic policy making. I shall provide two specific examples. One relates to the British Central Bank and the Monetary Policy Committee. Professor Buiter's comments this morning may partly reflect frustration at having no information about how the British central bank will be required to prepare for the transition to British membership. At some point, exchange rate management will have to be factored in to its terms of reference, and it is unclear how and on what time scale that will happen and when it will be issued with a new letter from the Chancellor. The Monetary Policy Committee currently remains in the dark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Government could do more to clarify the debate about the exchange rate. The Conservatives claim that the British exchange rate is set in the market, but if we join, the rate will have to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>667</span>
negotiated. A judgment will have to made about an appropriate exchange rate, and we should be debating what that might be in terms of overall competitiveness and its impact on inflation. There are various estimates, and no right or wrong answer, but we should at least be discussing the subject. Regrettably, the Government seem reluctant to engage in such preparatory debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I acknowledge that this is not an ideal time to consider admission to EMU—a message that was reinforced last week. The political environment and economic conditions are not presently right, but they can change rapidly. For six months the euro has been relatively weak, but the weakness has been exaggerated and is not as dramatic as it appears—and it could change tomorrow. With a fall in economic growth in the United States or a change in sentiment about the dollar, the overall circumstances could change and within months—certainly within a couple of years—we could have a completely different cyclical position. There could be a slow-down in the United States and a revival in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The economic environment could change rapidly, and British public opinion with it. That is why we need to be ready for a referendum and a decision on entry. Preparations must be made. The British public may reject entry—they have every right to do so—but if they decide to go ahead, we must be prepared. That is why these limited amounts of public expenditure are essential and prudent. We fully support the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had an interesting morning. The fact that the right hon. Member for Charnwood is not here today is significant. We are being deprived of his views on the matter, which would have been interesting to hear. I noticed both the heavy attendance on the Opposition Benches for most of today's proceedings, and the fact that a junior spokesperson opened this debate. That is something else to be borne in mind in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, we heard that a confidence trick might have been played on the British electorate last week, and that the Conservatives are not actually opposed to the euro. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton confirmed the message that came across in the European elections by saying that the Conservatives wish to keep their options open. That sets the context for our debate on clause 121.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Conservative party is a constitutional party. We recognise that no Parliament can choose its successor. What we will do in the next Parliament is relevant to our commitment now, and it is a matter to put before the electorate at the next election. That is a constitutional point. Individuals may have strong views on the extreme unlikelihood of our ever joining the euro, but the party's constitutional position is that we rule it out for the next Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, as he makes my point exactly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard the phrase, "in Europe but not run by Europe". We can add to that: "Not yet—but in five years, we may hoist a white flag and join anyway". That policy is quite incredible, and represents the
	<span class='label label-info column'>668</span>
absolute hypocrisy of the Conservative party at its worst. I feel somewhat guilty at allowing Conservative Members to get away with the argument that they are totally opposed to the euro.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Monday I took the train on the west coast line—my favourite line—and bumped into the hon. Member for Stone. As one might expect, he was rather happy about the weekend's election results. However, intriguingly, he told me that 60 per cent, of the Conservative party voted for him in the Back-Bench elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That says a lot about what is going on in the Conservative party. Obviously, there is a little bit of hope for the 40 per cent, of Conservative Members who did not vote for the hon. Gentleman. However, one is made aware of how deep the anti-European feeling runs in parts of the Conservative party. In spite of that, Conservative Members are still keeping their options open. That is clear now in a way that it never was before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree with the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healey), who said in the Employment Sub-Committee on 27 May 1999:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we may never reach a point where we can be fully confident"</p></blockquote>
about the decision to join the euro, and that the decision
	<br><blockquote><p>"will be as much an act of faith as it will an assessment of the robustness or future success of the single monetary policy."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made it clear that we would join a successful euro. There can be no doubt about our policy on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must explore a number of issues. Our debates are taking place as if the euro were a dark area and nothing had happened in relation to it. In fact, 50 per cent, of our trade is in the eurozone. Fourteen per cent, of small and medium-sized enterprises are already planning to use the euro, and the latest survey revealed that 247,000 companies intend to open euro accounts. Eighty-six per cent, of large retailers have suppliers in the eurozone, and 40 per cent, say that this year they are planning to pay eurozone suppliers in euros.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much is already happening, but the Conservative party seems to want to bury its head in the sand and ignore it all. Furthermore, the Inland Revenue, the Department of Social Security and other Departments use complex computer systems, so tax and duties can already be paid in euros.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are taking a sensible approach and addressing the matter sensibly. In contrast, the Opposition are generally hysterical on the issue and are unable to engage in a sensible debate. That muddies the water for a public debate on the issue. The Government's intentions in the clause are clear. They are trying to ensure that preparations are made that will allow us to enter the single currency should that be the decision of the British people in a referendum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the economic benefits, some Conservative Members are saying that they do not want to join anyway. That message seems to have disappeared in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>669</span>
the rhetoric that we heard during the European elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view is that we will join if an economic case is made and if it is in our best interests to join. That seems highly sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote one or two examples: ICI, the largest company in my constituency, which employs more than 4,000 people, told me that it has no doubt that this country will eventually join the euro. It can see no other scenario. It is appalled at what is being said in debates on the subject. ICI said that it is losing out to other companies in the European market and elsewhere because this country has not yet joined the euro and that it could save millions of pounds a year in transactions by dealing in the euro. Numerous other companies, large and small, have expressed the same opinion. My constituents are concerned about their jobs and their prosperity.

	<span class='label label-info column'>670</span>
every one, the common theme has been what the Government are doing to prepare the economy and businesses for possible entry to the single currency. I am sure that many of my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of us regret the passing of the days when the entire Finance Bill was taken on the Floor of the House. Given the circumstances of this year's Bill—and the nature of the clause—two days was inadequate time. It is also greatly regrettable that because of the change of timetable of the House on Thursdays, some of my colleagues find it difficult to be here today. They are out winning the next election while we are detaining Labour Members to educate them on a policy which they have made it clear they do not understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason we must consider the clause is that the Prime Minister told the House on 23 February:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If, as we have already announced, we want to keep open the option of making a decision early in the next Parliament to join, we need to step up our practical preparations now"—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 February 1999, Vol.326, C.180]</p></blockquote>
We are having to consider the clause today because of the Prime Minister's timetable for joining early in the next Parliament. Those who believe that the decision should be deferred until even later will surely agree that the clause should not be considered, and, in any event, agree that a referendum should be held first. It seems bizarre to take the speculative risk—the "exploratory risk", as the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) described it—of spending a great deal of money preparing for the euro when all the evidence, based on last week's historic results in the European elections, is that, in a referendum, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>671</span>
British public would say no. Those are the facts. We question whether it is right, or even proper, in the context of the Neill committee's findings, to give the Inland Revenue untrammelled power to spend taxpayers' money with so wide an ambit on any aspect of the preparations for the euro that it could effectively become almost a propaganda campaign by those who want to convince us that joining the euro is in some sense inevitable. As a result of both last week's elections, and the poor start to the life of the euro, the course of which on the foreign exchange markets has been diametrically the opposite of what its friends predicted before it was launched, it is evident that there is nothing inevitable about Britain joining the euro. Therefore there is no logical consequence that dictates that we should approve this expenditure by the Revenue.

We have heard from a number of Labour Back Benchers how, within a short time, we shall somehow be in a position to make an informed decision. The Governor and Deputy Governor of the Bank of England gave devastating evidence to the Select Committee on Employment the other day. Not only did the Deputy Governor say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is impossible to know what is too high a rate or what is too low a rate",</p></blockquote>
but he went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That is clearly one of the difficulties in making a decision".</p></blockquote>
The Governor himself said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is not a kind of simple obvious black and white answer"</p></blockquote>
when asked whether, and how, we should join. If two of the most senior independent experts in the country, who have a responsibility to advise the Government, are advising all of us that we cannot make a clear economic decision, then the Government's policy, which is to go in only when we can make an economic decision, is simply in tatters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gardiner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman expand a little on the context of the Governor's and Deputy Governor's remarks? Was it that it would be impossible now—rather than at the time of going in—to tell what rate would be appropriate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Wentworth will corroborate this, because it was evident that the Governor and Deputy Governor were saying that at any stage, it is impossible to tell whether one has the right exchange rate. They pointed to the example of the European exchange rate mechanism and said that at the time we entered the ERM, many were convinced that the exchange rate was right. They pointed out that the external shock of German reunification subsequently proved that it was the wrong rate at which to go in. The Governor and Deputy Governor cited that classic example to demonstrate that one simply cannot know what the right exchange rate is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wentworth confirmed that he was summarising the views of the Governor when he said that entry would be an act of faith, not an act chosen according to clear economic criteria. That means that the Government's strategy is in tatters. The Maastricht option had a destabilising influence on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>672</span>
previous Government, and it is now beginning to have a destabilising influence on this Government. Unlike them, we will avoid that problem when we are elected at the next election because we have said that we will rule out joining the single currency for the course of that Parliament. That will kick the matter into the long grass, and I have no doubt that it may be kicked into the long grass many times after that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, not only is it wrong for British industry to spend billions of pounds on preparing for joining the euro, but it is wrong for the Inland Revenue to spend its money in the same way. The Inland Revenue's guidance on clauses states that clause 121
	<br><blockquote><p>"provides legal cover for Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise to spend on preparing for the possibility of UK entry to the currency."</p></blockquote>
The note continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The revenue departments may need to spend some tens of millions of pounds."</p></blockquote>
It is instructive that the note talks of expenditure of tens of millions of pounds, although the clause itself places absolutely no limit on that expenditure. Ministers owe us an explanation of why, if the Inland Revenue clearly estimates that it needs tens of millions of pounds, the clause does not put a limit on its discretion. If it needs to spend more, the House should hold it to account and it should have to ask us for permission to spend more. At that point we might know whether the Government intended to offer the British public a referendum on the issue. It was noticeable that yesterday the Prime Minister did not want to put any date on, or even make any commitment to, holding such a referendum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another difficulty. There is a structural reason for not entering the euro. Again, we are indebted to the Governor and the Deputy Governor for the evidence that they gave us the other day. In the 18 years of the Conservative Government, this country achieved far more flexible labour markets, with the result that we now have far lower unemployment. That has not happened in the eurozone. When referring to action taken by countries in the eurozone to make their labour markets far more flexible, the Governor said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The actual action that has been taken to address the supply side is clearly inadequate".</p></blockquote>
That is a great stumbling block. Until Labour market flexibility in the eurozone is broadly equivalent to the flexibility in this country, there is no case to be made for any form of convergence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Governor used unemployment rates as a proxy for the success of labour market policies, and our unemployment rate is half that in the eurozone. He also told us that interest rates in the countries of the eurozone are half ours, because their unemployment rate is twice ours. He said that that was a slick response but a rough-and-ready guide to how much out of line they are. There is a direct correlation between the structural differences of this country's successful Thatcherite labour market policies and those in the eurozone, and the consequent level of interest rates. Even if, in the course of the next few years, interest rates in the two areas happened to coincide, that would be a temporary phenomenon and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>673</span>
would not, unless the problems in the labour market had been dealt with, indicate convergence of monetary requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Governor has just bought a house in Cornwall, where, this summer, there will be a full eclipse of the sun. That happens in an area once every 320 years. Interest rates in this country and in the eurozone may coincide slightly more often, but our economy's gravitational pull will still be in an entirely different direction to that of the other countries in continental Europe. Early entry into the system cannot, therefore, be contemplated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many other concerns about the poor financial state of eurozone countries, as evidenced by the breaking of the Maastricht borrowing criteria by Italy and the relaxation of those rules, which augurs badly for future confidence in the single currency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told frequently by the Prime Minister and Labour Members that if we do not show ourselves ready and willing, by passing this clause, to make an early decision to enter the euro, investment will be harmed. The Deputy Governor's evidence to the Select Committee was clear cut. He said that investment decisions
	<br><blockquote><p>"will hinge on the underlying real productivity performance, not on whether we are inside or outside monetary union".</p></blockquote>
A case cannot be made that delaying entry to the euro is harming employment in this country. The Committee heard some figures this morning about the level of Britain's trade with the euro zone. Exports to the euro zone constitute only 41 per cent, of our total exports, which was confirmed by the Bank of England in the evidence session. That means that nearly three fifths of our exports are to the dollar zone, the yen zone and other parts of the world. If we were in the euro zone, we would be hitched to a currency rate that was uncompetitive and damaging to more than half of our export trade. Given that our exports to other parts of the world are a far more dynamic engine of growth for our economy than those to the sick centre of Europe, we could be pursuing completely the wrong policy for this country's future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an ideal world, where all the euro zone countries had flexible labour markets and sound finances, those countries could happily live with one interest rate. In an ideal world, however, their currencies would not fluctuate against each other anyway. That is the catch-22 for the euro—it might only work in a situation where the benefits were not there in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must admit that the euro has nothing to do with economics; the economic arguments are overwhelmingly against taking the risk of joining the euro. The euro is about politics. This Committee is not the place for a debate about politics, but such a debate would have to take into account the serious constitutional issues that would be raised by joining the euro. Labour Members have made some play of our party's policy of ruling out joining the euro for the next Parliament. Constitutionally, I explained in an intervention, this Parliament cannot bind its
	<span class='label label-info column'>674</span>
successors. Only a person or a party that does not understand the importance of our constitution would demand that their opponents commit to an unconstitutional policy. That is distinct from the informed view of individual Members that we will not join, and more and more commentators are reaching that conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gardiner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that you, Mr. Cook, belong to the same party as the hon.

That is their problem. The Conservative party respects the constitution and would not play with fire over its future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No constitutional party should say never on such an important issue—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Individuals in the Conservative party have an informed view, which I respect and go a long way to accepting. The deep divisions in the Labour ranks are more serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The constitutional problem with committing future Governments to stay out of the euro would render the commitment meaningless. However, it would be a meaningful commitment to say at the next election that we will stay out of the euro, and I have every confidence that we will refresh that commitment at subsequent elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for retaining the euro option is similar to the argument for a nuclear deterrent. No one wants the nuclear deterrent activated, but it takes account of circumstances that no one today can imagine. The difference is that the money that we invested in building up our Trident nuclear deterrent has been rewarded by the payment of a peace dividend. The fact that we were prepared to modernise our nuclear deterrent was the final nail in the coffin of eastern European communism and we have a much more peaceful world as a result. We have reaped rich rewards from that policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty with the Government's policy of spending billions of pounds on preparations for the euro is that there will be no economic reward. That is why the clause is fundamentally wrong. Without a referendum, the policy is undemocratic. Anyone in the House who has a conscience will oppose the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Government's position on this issue is to prepare to keep our options open on whether we join. Both policies require preparations. The debate is about whether we prepare to enter; it is not about whether we enter at all. The Government believe that we should join if it is in the United Kingdom's interest, subject to a referendum. In sharp contrast to that, the Opposition's view is that we should not prepare; we should not look at it for 10 years, at which point we have another look and do not prepare again. It is a bizarre position. I know that the Opposition are buoyed by the recent election results, but fewer than one in 10 people agreed to the proposition, "In Europe, not run by Europe". I agree with that proposition. The whole election was run—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. We want to be at the heart of Europe, not run by Europe. People did not turn out to vote in the European Parliament election, so it is vacuous to suggest that the election has a major impact on whether we should prepare for a future option to join the single currency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The big issue is whether joining the euro will be in our economic interests. The business view is that the euro is the currency of Europe. Much of our investment, in both the financial and the manufacturing sectors, is predicated on the assumption that we will be part of the euro. The City's view is that we will enter. Indeed, there is a grave danger that, if anybody seriously thought that the Tories would win the next election, investment in the City and in manufacturing would begin to drain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently met a group of senior Japanese industrialists—managing directors and the like—with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry before he went to Japan. Their view was that uncertainty generates hedging, which generates a loss of investment share, both in plant and in financial institutions. Again, their view was predicated on the belief that, when conditions were right, we would join the single currency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a threat to jobs if we do not prepare to join the euro. If we say, "We will not prepare", we will be sending a signal to the market that it is unlikely that we will ever join. That would influence investment decisions and lose jobs, not in the future, but now. Therefore, we must prepare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I recognise that there is a debate about whether we should join. We may join, so we should prepare—that is the essence of our argument. I know that there have been discussions about exchange rate flexibility, transfers across Europe and whether Maastricht borrowing contains limitations for independent currencies, but that is not the point. We accept that there are arguments, but we should prepare for one of the eventualities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As Opposition Front-Bench Members have acknowledged, there is not a monopoly on this, but the view is that investors will shift, and are shifting, their investment out of Britain while uncertainty continues, and the more uncertainty there is, the greater the threat. If we did not prepare for entry as one option, there would be job losses. That is clearly the case, as I am sure Eddie George would agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we did not prepare to join and a referendum showed that most people were in favour of joining, what would be the situation for the British economy and the British people? There would be a complete shambles in the public and private sectors. As I have said, the euro is becoming the currency of business. As euros come into our hands and pockets, we will find them traded in our shops, irrespective of whether we decide to join. The euro will be a live currency in our nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We talk about sovereignty. Surely sovereignty is our ability to influence our own future, which also embraces our ability to shape the context in which choices are made. The Tories always forget that, unless we are at the centre of Europe, effecting change, we are losing our sovereignty by being on the sidelines of Europe and influenced by what it does. The clause will widen our choices, enabling us to move into the single currency if it is in our economic interests to do so. If we were to agree to the amendment, we would block one of our choices, and if the British people then voted for that choice, they would be penalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have adopted a responsible position on this matter. The Opposition's position is one of political opportunism, not founded on Britain's economic interests. It is myopic and will whip up anti-European sentiments in a small minority of the British public. The Opposition are irresponsible to do that. The chaos that has been mentioned in association with the millennium bug would pale into insignificance compared to the impact on Britain of any move towards joining the single currency unprepared. The Government's policy is to do what is right for Britain, and that means preparing for all options.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have been prompted into contributing by the speech made by the hon. Member for Twickenham, who appears to be labouring under the misapprehension that existing Government accounting rules preclude Departments' spending money in anticipation of an Act of Parliament. That is not the case. The reason that we tabled the amendment is that the Government wish to go
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>677</span>
beyond the rules in spending substantial sums of public money without parliamentary or popular approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not reply in detail to the speeches made by Labour members of the Committee, although I have seldom heard such a collection of economic claptrap and political wishful thinking. One would have thought that the results of the European parliamentary elections last week would have taught them a lesson about what their constituents think about Labour policy on Europe—they are clearly unimpressed. In my constituency, those parties supporting the Government line on European policy and the euro saw their share of the vote collapse, whereas the Conservative party's policy on those matters received a strong popular endorsement. One would have thought that Labour Members would have understood that by now, but if they have not, it is a problem for their party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that it is also a problem for the country. There is now no coherent case being made for the euro. I would welcome the Prime Minister taking a lead in explaining what he believes the case for joining the euro to be. We could then have a healthy, democratic debate. However, he has apparently withdrawn from the field, leaving the job to a collection of Back Benchers who have advanced a number of bizarre economic arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unsurprising that in today's 	<i>Financial Times,</i> the chairman of Unilever, Niall FitzGerald, has complained, asking the Prime Minister to put forward his case. If business is to make the case for the euro, the impetus must come from the Prime Minister, for example, by attending the launch of the Britain in Europe campaign. That is the view of the chairman of Unilever, a well-known supporter of the euro. However, the Prime Minister is apparently vacillating about this, as he is about everything else, so we have instead a number of confused and muddled apologies for the euro case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman state for the record, in order to make it clear for everyone, that he is happy to keep open the option of joining the euro?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That entails keeping open the option on the euro in the long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the case advanced by the Liberal Democrats, the hon. Member for Twickenham did not demand to know exactly what the Government would be spending. He seemed to be happy to give the Government a blank cheque so that they can spend almost anything on preparing for the euro.

the right hon. Gentleman and ask him why the Conservative party does not engage in that process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably, there is an answer to the question of how many tens of millions of pounds will be spent as a result of the clause, but we are not told the answer in the notes on clauses, which rather coyly refer to the possibility that some tens of millions of pounds may be spent by the revenue departments on preparations for the United Kingdom's possible entry. The Committee wants to know how many tens of millions of pounds. I apologise if that has already been made clear—if that is the case, we shall obviously hear about it from the Minister—but it is an important point because we know that the information exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been persuading the private sector to draw up detailed plans. Indeed, many glossy brochures have come our way. The second report, "Getting ready for the euro campaign", informs us that 1,500 euro co-ordinators are now in place throughout the public sector. It would be a start if we knew what they cost. More importantly, the euro co-ordinators have presumably drawn up their own plans for extra expenditure on preparations for the possible changeover. If the public sector has not made such preparations, it is guilty of startling hypocrisy because it is telling everyone else to do so. A chart at the back of the report refers to a Standing Committee on preparing for the euro, of which the hon. Member for Twickenham is a member, a business advisory group, a euro preparations unit, the Government Offices for the Regions, business links with training and enterprise councils, banks and other public bodies, and the Bank of England. Everyone seems to be working on it. However, we want to know the total possible cost, both of the eventual changeover to the euro—if Parliament and the people so decide—and, in this morning's debate, we want to know what expenditure by the revenue departments we are authorising. The reference to "some tens of millions" is completely inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to another issue on which I can perhaps illuminate the Committee. I mentioned existing accounting rules. On 10 August 1998, the Treasury wrote to all Government Departments reminding them of the rules that govern what sort of expenditure can be incurred by Departments in advance of legal cover by way of an Act. The rules are not new, and they are set out in chapter 2 of the guide, "Government Accounting". The rules assert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"expenditure resting on the authority of a specific Act of Parliament should not take place until Royal Assent has been obtained."</p></blockquote>
That is a sensible rule because it means that the Executive cannot prejudge the decision of the House of Commons and incur public expenditure before an Act has been passed. All parliamentarians should agree with that. However, the rules go on to say that there is agreement and approval for some expenditure to be undertaken in advance of an Act of Parliament, such as,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the formulation and examination of alternative policy options".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>679</span>
Therefore, in the case of the euro, it would be perfectly in order for the Treasury or other Departments to draw up alternative scenarios and present them to the public. The document says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it will…be reasonable to include under 5b above"—</p></blockquote>
the section to which I referred—
	<br><blockquote><p>"any expenditure which is considered necessary so that the general public can make an informed decision when they vote in the referendum. It would also be necessary to be in a position to tell Parliament, business and the public the detailed arrangements that would apply during the changeover."</p></blockquote>
No additional clause is necessary for Departments to undertake that expenditure. It is entirely misleading for the hon. Member for Twickenham to assert that the Opposition believe that no such expenditure should be undertaken—that is not the thrust of our amendment. However, we do object to the Government ignoring long-standing accounting rules and trying to acquire powers, so that the revenue departments can spend additional money on the changeover plan. We want details on those powers, which are explicitly ruled out under existing accounting rules. For example, Departments cannot anticipate Parliament's decision or, by extension, the result of a referendum, by taking on additional staff, acquiring accommodation or changing IT systems. However, that is what the Government are trying to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Economic Secretary will explain the anticipated expenditure. Two days ago, a leaked letter was published in the press, showing that the Government asked civil servants to assemble euro-friendly stories and report them to the centre. If the civil service's much-valued impartiality and neutrality were to be interfered with, that would be a serious matter. For example, one could imagine a situation in which the revenue departments were given money not simply to change systems to accept payment in euros, but to persuade business to make payment in euros before the referendum was held or the parliamentary decision taken. It would be even worse if civil servants were asked to assemble, receive and collate good—from the Government's viewpoint—news stories on businesses that are asking to pay in euros, and send them to the Cabinet Office or Mr. Alastair Campbell, so that they can be published in the press. In order to stop such suborning of the civil service, we want to know what expenditure the Government are seeking to authorise. That is a legitimate request that, I hope, I make on behalf of the whole Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, there is the question of timing. We thought that we knew that the Government intended to hold the referendum shortly after the next general election, so that Departments had at least some steer as to the likely time scale for incurring expenditure. However, the Prime Minister is clearly shifting his position. He is apparently withdrawing from the campaign to persuade people to accept the euro. The Government are committed to giving up the pound and joining the euro, but they do not intend to explain why. That is odd. The timetable may be slipping, but the expenditure implications are also changing, almost weekly. It is quite wrong for Parliament to authorise
	<span class='label label-info column'>680</span>
tens of millions of pounds of expenditure on a project, the outcome and timing of which are uncertain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Economic Secretary illuminate the matter further by saying whether the expenditure has an end date? If the Government continually put back the likely date for the referendum, at what point will the money run out and have to be replaced? At what point will the Government instruct the revenue departments to stop wasting money? Given that uncertainty, our amendment has become more important in the past few days and we look forward to a comprehensive reply before voting on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a fascinating debate on clause 121. We have seen an Opposition who claim to be immensely concerned and exercised about the matter, but with a turnout that at times has fallen even lower than that in the recent European Parliament election. We heard a pathetic performance from the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who is not in his seat to hear the ministerial reply which he so energetically asked for a short while ago. I suppose that we must make allowances for three members of the Opposition team being demob happy, having become ex-members of the shadow Treasury team.

In one of his less courteous comments, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton let slip a new Opposition policy—support for age discrimination.

The hon. Gentleman's position on preparation is absurd and was brilliantly demolished by several Labour Members and by the hon. Member for Twickenham in a thoughtful contribution.

As we saw in the recent European Parliament election, the Conservative party is now an anti-European party and I have no doubt that the right hon. Member for Charnwood is not in his place today because he would be embarrassed. Perhaps he was ordered by his Whip not to be here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know from what the Leader of the Opposition said during the campaign for the European Parliament election that the Conservative party has an extreme, anti-European position and has abandoned any pretence of representing Britain's national interest. The Conservative leader said that he wanted the terms of Britain's membership of the European Union to be renegotiated and we know from the 1980s that that is code for withdrawal. He wanted a referendum on the Amsterdam treaty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the hon. Lady has heard this morning about the problems in Europe of labour market inflexibility, would it not be wise for the Government to renegotiate the working time directive and other measures in the social chapter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a bit rich from a supporter of the previous Government, who left this country isolated in the European Union and now seek to restore that isolation. This Government's policy is to have structured engagement with Europe. We have ensured that economic reform is now high on the European agenda and have received agreement from our major trading partners in Europe for economic and structural reform, in particular of the capital, labour and product market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to understand the point, will the Economic Secretary confirm that she believes that we should sign up to more labour market inflexibility with the unemployment cost that that creates. Is that her idea of being against Europe, because that is what her Government do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in favour, as are the British people, of fair standards for working people: reasonable restrictions on maximum working hours and a minimum wage. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for confirming again that the Conservative party is against a minimum wage, maximum limits on working hours and fair protection for working people. The Conservative party constantly changes its policy. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will tell us that the Conservative party is now in favour of the minimum wage, although it voted against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Leader of the Opposition made it clear in recent weeks that he wants the terms of British membership to be renegotiated, which is code for withdrawal. He wants to scrap any preparations for
	<span class='label label-info column'>682</span>
the euro and to opt out of European treaties, and he opposes the principle of a single currency. That is the extremism of the modern Conservative party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Conservatives see themselves in Europe but not of Europe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The inherent and inevitable logic of the position advanced by the Leader of the Opposition before the European Parliament election is that Britain would again be marginalised, isolated and ineffective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I understand the natural tendency to speak directly to hon. Members who intervene, but I must offer a mild admonishment that comments should be directed to the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that reminder, Mr. Cook, and I shall, of course, follow it.

The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said this morning that he was happy with the spending that has already taken place on preparations for the introduction of the euro on 1 January. That was an extraordinary statement, because that is not the position of the Leader of the Opposition. On 1 June, during the election campaign for the European Parliament election, the Leader of the Opposition said that the planned changeover had already cost the taxpayer £165 million and he called for spending on preparations to be scrapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman's position and his numbers were nonsense. The amount spent by the Treasury, the Bank of England and the revenue departments on preparations for the creation of the euro on 1 January was some £29 million—a modest sum. At least the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton agrees that it was well spent. However, he could not conceal the Conservative party's isolation—not simply its desire to isolate Britain in Europe, but its own isolation now in the European Parliament. I am not sure whether members of the Conservative party have yet said whether they will sit with fascist Members of the European Parliament, but I understand that they have decided that their MEPs will not remain part of the EPP. They are as isolated in the European Parliament as they want Britain to be in the European Union as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to correct the Economic Secretary on one point: the decision as to which group Conservative MEPs will belong to is for the Leader of the Conservative party, who will take that decision in due course. However, she will be pleased to know that the Conservative group in the European Parliament is being courted by many different groups, because it now represents such a powerful influence in that Parliament after last week's election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that clarification from the hon. Gentleman. Labour Members will watch with great interest the alliances that Conservative MEPs form in the European Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to Government policy on this issue and to our commitment to prepare and then decide. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer made clear in his statement to the House in October
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>683</span>
1997, and as my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister reaffirmed earlier this year on publication of the draft outline national changeover plan, if, in our judgment, membership of a successful single currency were good for the British economy, British jobs, British industry and the City, of course we would join. As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said, the national changeover plan indicated a change of gear—a step change—in the scale of preparation, not making membership an inevitability or slipping it through in the absurd way suggested by some Conservative Members, but ensuring that the British people have a real choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his statement to the House on 23 February, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is also necessary to prepare for Britain being part of it. If, as we have already announced, we want to keep open the option of making a decision early in the next Parliament to join, we need to step up our practical preparations now; hence the national changeover plan."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where computer systems are being upgraded, all Departments will build in euro compatibility where that represents value for money. In the case of the Department of Social Security, the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise, the scale and complexity of their computer systems makes advance preparations critical.…They may need to spend some money prior to a referendum to make their information technology systems euro-compatible, so that we can maintain the flexibility for Britain to make the changeover as quickly and cost-effectively as possible.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It is right that Parliament should be asked to give explicit approval to such expenditures, which will amount to some tens of millions of pounds spread over a number of years. We will therefore include provisions in the Finance Bill and the Social Security Bill that will authorise this spending".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 February 1999; Vol. 326, c. 180.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Conservative party when in Government had made similar sensible plans before entering into the exchange rate mechanism, might it not have avoided the mess that it got into at that time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Because the previous Government refused to make any preparations, Britain could not have joined the single currency on 1 January this year even if we had wanted to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was another flaw in the arguments of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. He implied that the Conservative party might change its mind and support British membership of a single currency. However, that decision would be futile because none of the necessary preparation would have been carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party's view is out of line with that of business in this country—and, indeed, with that of many of its members. In response to the Prime Minister's statement on the national changeover plan, Lord Levene, the Lord Mayor of London, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The important thing is we are now preparing".</p></blockquote>
Lord Marshall, the chairman of British Airways and a member of the Chancellor's standing committee, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it was eminently sensible to prepare for membership".</p></blockquote>
[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford refers to Lord Marshall, one of this
	<span class='label label-info column'>684</span>
country's most distinguished business men, as a "crony". That is a disgraceful slur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason why Lord Marshall cannot be taken seriously on this issue is that, although he lectures everyone else about investing and going further into Europe, he is taking his airline into an alliance with American Airlines. He says one thing and does another, a bug that he caught from the Prime Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished at the attitude of Opposition Members towards both Lord Marshall and Lord Levene, who have made a distinguished and serious contribution to the economic success of this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having heard this morning that the Governor of the Bank of England believes that joining the euro is an "act of faith", does the Economic Secretary agree that the decision cannot be made on scientific economic grounds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have made the position clear. In October 1997 my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister set out in a statement the five economic tests that will enable us to judge whether membership of a successful single currency is in the interests of this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me quote another response to the national changeover plan.
	<br><blockquote><p>"I welcome the marked change of tone which today's statement represents. I particularly welcome the fact that you have reached an agreement with the representatives of the majority of British business on the practical steps that are now to be taken to give some reality to your policy of 'prepare and decide'."</p></blockquote>
That was the view of the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). The right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You have been absolutely right in everything which has been said this afternoon. I welcome that."</p></blockquote>
and urged that preparations be carried out as "speedily as possible". The former Deputy Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine), said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Changeover plan would be widely welcomed".</p></blockquote>
It is fascinating that some of the most distinguished and senior members of the Conservative party are treated with derision by Conservative Front and Back-Bench members of the Committee. It reveals the extremism of the modern Conservative party leadership and its decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree that one problem with the issue of Europe is that unfortunately, the great and the good, with their fashionable thinking, do not agree with the vast majority of the British people? To describe the people who are expressing their views as "extremist" is foolish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman ignores the fact that his view was supported by fewer than 10 per cent, of the British people in a recent poll.

	<span class='label label-info column'>685</span>
Clause 121 provides the statutory authority that the Prime Minister undertook to establish to permit spending in preparation for a possible decision to join the single currency. We must prepare so that we have a genuine choice. The provision is prudent and preserves parliamentary accountability. Like all Government policy, it is in the interests of the British people. I urge my hon. Friends to reject this absurd amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
