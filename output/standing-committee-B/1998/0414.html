	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Hunter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Basingstoke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are greatly privileged that you are presiding over our proceedings this morning, Mr. Benton. I apologise in advance for a discourtesy that I might commit this morning. My private Member's Bill will enter Committee at 11.30 am, and I shall feel obliged to leave in good time to prepare for that. I apologise if I leave before our proceedings are completed, but I am sure that that will be a relief to some members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we drew stumps at the previous sitting, I had spoken to amendment No. 24, and I propose to summarise in only two or three sentences what I tried to argue then. My argument was that claimants under the land compensation code are entitled to have their reasonable professional advisers fees paid for them by the acquiring authority, and that that should apply to mink farmers as well. I expressed the hope—and I do so again—that the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle) will
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
accept the logic of that. Her Bill will create a unique situation for a specialist form of farming, so it is essential that those concerned have access to good quality professional advice when negotiating their compensation claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was mid-way through my argument for amendment No. 25 when the Committee adjourned. It is an irrefutable fact that since 1973, claimants for compensation under the land compensation code have been entitled to request advance payments on account of 90 per cent. of the agreed compensation, or—this is more usual—of the acquiring authority's initial estimate of their entitlement. The reason for that is self-evident. It can take months—sometimes years—before a final settlement is reached in a compensation case. That is why there is provision under the land compensation code for an advance down payment of the stated proportion. The argument for that is that it is reasonable for people entitled to compensation to be enabled to reorganise their affairs—for example, by setting up another business—by receiving up front a substantial proportion of the compensation due to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. Member for Garston to address that argument. Surely it is only fair and reasonable that provision for advance down payment under the land compensation code should be matched by the compensation scheme to be set up under the Bill. Moreover, if the hon. Lady and the Government want mink farmers to go earlier rather than later, the mechanism that I propose would enable that. My amendment would simply extend to fur farming the same compensation rights that exist for land compensation, and it would be unfair and unreasonable to reject it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 26 would add a new paragraph between subsections (2) and (3). The argument for it is straightforward and uncomplicated, but that does not diminish its strength. I call this a natural justice amendment, and I hope that the Committee will agree with that assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is self-evident that, until a claimant receives the compensation award that he has negotiated, he cannot put that award to use. He cannot invest it or earn interest from it. The amendment would make provision for the calculation of the interest that the final settlement would have accrued between the day that the recipient became entitled to it and the day that he eventually received it. The recipient of the compensation would receive that sum in addition to the final settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The precedent is well established. Claimants under the compulsory purchase code are entitled to claim interest on their outstanding compensation. My argument is simple: the same arrangement should apply to fur farmers who are put out of business by the Bill. I can see no reason why that should not be the case. If the hon. Member for Garston and the Minister disagree and reject the amendment, I will be interested to learn how they justify treating some victims of compulsory purchase differently from others. I speculate that they will find that a difficult position to justify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 27, the last in the group, would insert another new paragraph between subsections (2) and (3). Another unique feature of the Bill, and one of the unique developments that will arise from it, relates to the capital
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0681">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
investment in mink farming. No professional opinion has been given that mink farms' specialised buildings and equipment can be converted to any other type of farming or business use; they will become useless. Amendment No. 27 would address that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If fur farming is banned, the land on which fur farming is practised will have to be cleared. The estimated costs of clearing land to bring it back to green-field site status that I have received are £98,000 for a 6,000—female farm, and £52,000 for a 3,000—female farm. Those are substantial sums. However, land clearing must happen before the land can be put to any other farming or business use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 27 is another natural justice amendment. It would ensure that the costs of clearance were recognised in the compensation schemes. It would be wholly unreasonable if that were not so. I hope that the hon. Member for Garston will incorporate that provision in the Bill and so ensure that the costs of clearance become claimable under the compensation scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To summarise, amendment No. 24 would allow the inclusion of the reasonable fees of professional advisers in the compensation award, as is the case under the land compensation code. Amendment No. 25 would entitle the recipient of compensation to payment on account of a proportion of the acquiring authority's initial estimate within three months. Again, such entitlement applies under the land compensation code. Amendment No. 26 would entitle the recipient to compound interest on the compensation award, as is the case under the compulsory purchase code. Amendment No. 27 would ensure that the compensation award includes the cost of land clearance. I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Maria Eagle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Garston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Benton. The Committee was well controlled and guided by the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Dr. Clark) in its first sitting, and I am certain that it will be so this morning as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make a small number of points about the amendments, but I shall leave answers to substantive questions about the Government's thinking to my hon. Friend the Minister, for which I hope the hon. Member for Basingstoke will forgive me. The clause is intended to set out provisions for compensation. It is not for me to lay down the precise details, but to establish a fair compensation scheme for people whose livelihoods will be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the amendments draw analogies with the removal of land from private individuals, and the hon. Member for Basingstoke spoke of compulsory purchase and land compensation. The difference is that the Bill removes the livelihoods of affected farmers, but does not take their land from them. Therefore, the analogy with land compensation and the various provisions in respect of it is not as close as the hon. Gentleman suggested—redundancy is a closer analogy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not intend to set out in the Bill details of compensation and the way in which it should be paid; that is properly left to the Government, who will make the
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
payments. It is for me to try to ensure that the scheme is fair, but not to attempt to settle its specific detail in the Bill. That is why the clause sets out a general procedure but does not go into the detail proposed in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make further points in the clause stand part debate. I wanted only to tell the hon. Member for Basingstoke that I do not accept his analogy between the removal of people's land and the effects of the Bill. The owners of land will still be its owners after the Bill is enacted and farms have been closed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Elliot Morley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you the Chair, Mr. Benton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Garston made her point about land very well, and it should be emphasised. As she said, the detail of the compensation is a matter for the Government. As a Government, we have accepted the implications of the clause, which makes compensation available to fur farmers. The compensation will be necessary only after the Bill has passed all its stages; the Government can then deal with the detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can, however, give the hon. Member for Basingstoke some reassurances. The Government consider that most of his points are not unreasonable In respect of amendment No. 24, we are prepared to consider professional fees when setting up the compensation scheme. We accept that fur farmers will need to be advised, and it is not unreasonable to consider the costs involved. However, the amendment is technically deficient: although it restricts fees payable to "reasonable fees", it does not appear to limit the number of professional advisers that fur farmers can retain. I do not think that the hon. Member for Basingstoke intends that armies of legal advisers should be engaged to give advice. However, we are quite prepared to consider the principle of legal advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 25 provides for an interim payment of compensation. Again, we are not against the principle of the hon. Gentleman's argument. If there were a long-running wrangle about the level of payments, we would have no objection to an interim payment. Incidentally, if such a case went to the Lands Tribunal, it may determine an interim payment. We would have no problems with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the figure of 90 per cent. is rather high, particularly in the case of a disputed sum. It is difficult to accept the principle of paying 90 per cent. of a disputed sum, and I do not think that we could accept an amendment to that effect. If there were a discussion on the compensation award, we would have no objection in principle to an interim payment. We are certainly prepared to consider the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 26, we are not against the principle of interest if there is an unreasonably long delay in settling a claim. Obviously, such a provision would need a clear start date for interest payments, and the amendment does not cover that. Again, if the matter went to the Lands
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0682">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
Tribunal, it might want to make a declaration on it as part of its proceedings. As a general principle, however, we are prepared to consider whether interest should be paid in the case of unreasonably long delays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 27 deals with compensation for the cost of clearing land. We do not dispute that putting a site back into use or making it available for alternative use may have to involve the demolition of some of the buildings and fixtures. I can give the hon. Member for Basingstoke an assurance that, as a general principle, we are prepared to consider the costs of demolition in relation to a claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should, however, make it clear mat the hon. Gentleman underestimated the possibility that some buildings could be put to alternative business use. In that respect, it would not be unreasonable for us to consider claims on their individual merits. Individual fur farmers would need to demonstrate that the costs of demolition were absolutely essential to reclaiming the site. They would also have to demonstrate that they had properly considered whether there was an appropriate alternative use for the buildings or fixtures on the site. That is not unreasonable, and we would have to be persuaded that those issues had been considered. If the case were made that demolition was absolutely necessary, we would, again, be prepared to consider the implications of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am greatly encouraged by the tone of the Minister's reply. I appreciate that there can be a world of difference between considering something and committing oneself to it. The Minister talked in terms of consideration, and I welcome that move. I accept the sincerity with which he made his case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the four amendments, the Minister expressed the opinion that amendment No. 24 was technically deficient. I thought that the wording "reasonable fees" covered matters, but the Minister objected and I may be mistaken. There may be circumstances in which 90 per cent. could be too high a figure for compensation in advance or, as a down payment. I agree that there could be a wide variation between the initial authority's estimate and the mink farmer's expectations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Minister is not against the principle of compound interest—nor could he be because it is already established in law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On ground clearance, I appreciate that the odd lesser building might not have to be cleared. I do not see that anyone would object to individual on-site decisions being made in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of what the Minister has said, we can probably return to the themes of the amendments at a later stage, and more dialogue can take place before that point is reached. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 3, line 37, leave out from 'referred' to end of line 42 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'to the arbitration of such person as may be agreed between the person and the appropriate authority, or in default of agreement, to an arbitrator nominated by the President of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.'.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
Clause 5 gives the appropriate authority, as defined in clause 6, power by order to make scheme for paying compensation to persons who incur losses as a result of discontinuing fur farming because of the coming into force of the prohibition in clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) covers disputes about a person's entitlement under a compensation scheme or the amounts of compensation. Such disputes are to be referred to the Lands Tribunal. I have received a considerable amount of advice and comment about this, as I have on other aspects of the Bill. The stipulation that disputes are to be referred to the Lands Tribunal has caused genuine concern, which I shall explain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lands Tribunal is notorious for being exceedingly slow in reaching decisions on disputes. It is also exceedingly expensive in terms of professional fees. However, those criticisms are nothing compared with the condemning findings of the recent Government-commissioned City university report on compulsory purchase. I do not know if the Minister is familiar with that report. It found that the Lands Tribunal—I quote from paragraph 5.72—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is not acting as an effective forum for settling compensation disputes, especially for owners".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 5.74 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Few of the professionals involved in the process have first hand experience…Furthermore, experience levels are much lower for those advising owners than among acquiring authority valuers".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 5.75 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Owners who are not satisfied with the compensation they are offered decide against challenging it formally because of the cost".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 5.76 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The cost of taking a case to the Lands Tribunal is high…As a result, the Lands Tribunal is not accessible as a forum for resolving disputes and so is not fulfilling its role".</p></blockquote>
None of that makes encouraging reading, to say the least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Garston would agree that justice needs to be done fairly, at a reasonable cost and in a reasonable time frame. As amendment No. 28 suggests, the better solution would be for disputes to be dealt with by arbitration. If the claimant and the authority could not agree on the arbitrator, it should be appointed by the president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The RICS is the professional body with the best expertise on valuation of land and business for compensation purposes. I hope that the hon. Lady will consider the amendment with a fair and open mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I may deal with this matter, as it is an issue that the Government will have to address if the Bill progresses successfully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a general principle, when it comes to arbitration, a formal judicial procedure is better than an informal one, although informal arbitration is used quite extensively for agricultural mattes. Although I think that there are advantages in using a body such as the Lands Tribunal, I do not have particularly strong views about the matter. There is an argument to be considered, and I approach it with an open mind. If there are strong feelings about this aspect of the Bill, we are prepared to listen to the arguments and give further consideration to the matter.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0683">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
However, I should like some time to reflect on this and to engage the opinion of people who will be affected by the procedures that will be available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Garston has, quite rightly, included in the Bill a provision for an appeal, should the offers of compensation be thought inadequate. From the Government's point of view, some form of appeal procedure is important: the question is, what is the best and most appropriate form?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Maria Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My intention in framing the Bill in this way was to ensure that there was an independent appeal procedure in respect of the compensation clause that would be able to resolve irreconcilable differences between the Government and the farmers affected. I thought it important to make that a judicial appeal, not because I used to be lawyer in my spare time, but because there are certain rights under European legislation and the European Court in respect of taking people's livelihoods away from them which allow appeals to Europe if here has not been a proper judicial procedure. I was seeking to cover that element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My intention is certainly not to increase litigation, nor to require mink farmers to go through European judicial procedures in order to feel that they have got a fair deal. I was seeking to deal with both those issues by including an independent appeals procedure in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Minister, I am perfectly happy to listen to alternative proposals. However, I am worried that the appeal proposed in amendment No. 28 is not really a judicial appeal. If farmers are still dissatisfied at the end of the arbitration process, it is open to them to engage in judicial appeals. The amendment leaves the Government open to further appeals beyond those provided in the Bill. That would cause me some concern, although, as a former lawyer, I understand the criticisms that the hon. Member for Basingstoke makes of the Lands Tribunal. No judicial process is cheap, and very few are quick. I understand his point, but I fear that the amendment could lead to longer delays and further proceedings by having the arbitration process first and all kinds of judicial procedures thereafter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both the hon. Member for Garston and the Minister have said quite sufficient for me not to wish to force the issue at this time. I am prepared to concede that perhaps the amendment did not fully cover the judicial appeal aspect. On the other hand, I think that the concern about the Lands Tribunal is valid. So I suggest that we adjourn the debate on the amendment, and reconsider the issues for debate at a later stage. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is stating the obvious to say that if the Bill were successfully to reach the statute book, clause 5 would be extremely important to the dozen or so mink fanning businesses because it deals with compensation. It is therefore a matter of concern mat clause 5 does not throw adequate light on the nature of the compensation scheme that the Government may be contemplating. I acknowledge what the hon. Member for Garston said: she is setting up the procedure, and it is for the Government to implement—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Is the Minister commenting from a sedentary position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise; I was muttering rather than intervening. It is difficult to set out in the Bill a compensation scheme to deal with each individual case. It is better to give the general principles; the detailed provision can then be resolved once the Bill becomes law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that in a moment and argue that we do not know sufficient of the principles to judge the issue. It is more than a matter of concern that the details of such a vital part of the Bill remain shrouded in mystery at this stage. It is an unsatisfactory state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, what we do know about the compensation scheme from clause 5 gives rise to equal concern. If I understand the Bill correctly—no doubt I shall be put right if I do not—it seems that the schemes will be discretionary. Clause 5 does not oblige the Minister to introduce them. The amendments to the clause tabled by the hon. Member for Garston suggest that it would be possible for there to be separate and different schemes—or no schemes at all—in different parts of Great Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister confirms that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Minister suggested that compensation was a matter of detail which could be addressed after the Bill had become law and, if I understood him correctly, he made the same point today. That possibility, combined with the fact that compensation will be discretionary, is being received with the utmost cynicism in some quarters. That is not surprising. It is feared that all the talk about compensation could be a gigantic confidence trick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another dimension. How can Parliament be expected to form a proper judgment on the Bill before the details are clearly known and available? We want to know the mechanism whereby a very small number of people will be compensated. How can those few hon. Members with fur farms in their constituencies possibly support the Bill until we have an unequivocal assurance that all mink farmers will be compensated and the details of the compensation scheme are known? The fact mat mink farmers are few in number is immaterial; the principle is absolute and binding. Their livelihoods will be destroyed and they must receive fair compensation.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0684">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
I hope that the Minister may be able to assure that Committee that he will publish a detailed statement regarding a draft compensation scheme well before Report, so that the Bill can be properly judged. Several hon. Members are under the impression that they should already have received information from the Minister about the compensation schemes, but I am told that that information has not yet materialised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What advice has the Minster taken about the details of the compensation scheme? Has he, for example, considered the principles that apply to the compulsory acquisition of land and businesses, some of which I have just referred to? Unless mink farmers can see that they will be treated fairly, there will be no incentive for them to wind up their businesses on an early time scale, which is presumably what the Bill's supporters want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have made the essential points. It is extremely difficult to approve a Bill that does not contain sufficient detail on which to judge the value and validity of the compensation scheme. That is the dilemma that we face. I hope that the Minister may be able to say more on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Maria Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause gives the appropriate authority power by order to make a scheme for paying compensation to persons who are affected and incur losses as a result of the discontinuation of their businesses. Subsection (3) provides for an appeals procedure, whereby the Minister will be required to refer any dispute over entitlement to payments under the scheme to the Lands Tribunal and an appropriate judicial authority. Any order made under the clause by statutory instrument will be subject to the negative resolution procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Basingstoke's advocacy for compensation. His view is clearly that a precise, detailed scheme should be written into the Bill, or, if not, that assurances in that regard should be given in great detail before the Bill is passed. I have some sympathy with him, but his view is not shared by many of his right hon. and hon. Friends who spoke on Second Reading. The right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) and the hon. Members for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls) and for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) all said that prohibition with compensation was not the appropriate way in which to deal with the relevant animal welfare issues. On Second Reading, at column 1354, it was argued that animal welfare standards should be increased to an acceptable level—although some of us doubt that that is possible. If farmers were driven out of business as a result, the hon. Member for Teignbridge said that that would be "Tough", and the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham said that it would be "Hard cheese."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members who spoke against the Bill on Second Reading were of the opinion that paying compensation was not the appropriate way in which to deal with the matter; their view was that we should simply increase animal welfare standards, and that if farmers could not meet those economic requirements, that would be tough—they should go out of business with no compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Lady has missed a central point. On Second Reading, the House accepted the principles of the Bill. Compensation is allowed for in the Bill. We are now debating the Bill in Committee, and I am arguing for the best possible compensation deal. Regardless of whether I initially preferred that option, the House has decided. I am arguing that, having accepted the principles of the Bill, we must now ensure that it is as good as it can be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Maria Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman on that last point. The Bill received an unopposed Second Reading—although many of the hon. Gentleman's right hon. and hon. Friends spoke against its principles, they did not press it to a Division. It is indeed important that the Bill is as good as it can be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said several times, my view on compensation is that the scheme in the Bill must be sufficiently flexible to deal with the requirements and circumstances of remaining fur farmers. We would not do the House any favours if we were to pass a Bill with extremely detailed provisions that proved too inflexible to deal with individual circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it is true that under subsection (1) the Minsiter's power—now the authority's power—to make a compensation scheme by order is by definition discretionary, I should be most surprised if anyone seriously suggested that the Government would give assurances about paying compensation and then, once the Bill was enacted, say, "Oh, it was all a joke. Actually we will not make any such provisions." Technically, the power is discretionary, but no one should doubt that as fair a scheme as possible will be proposed—I leave my hon. Friend the Minister to make any further comments that he wants about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerning compensation for capital equipment, the hon. Member for Basingstoke suggested that there was no other use for equipment used on mink farms. We know of one farmer in Scotland who switched to strawberry production when he left the mink industry. He found that the waist-high benches in the mink sheds were ideal for grow-bags. They were at a convenient height to grow strawberries, which one could even pick without ending up with backache. It is not absolutely true that there is no other use for the equipment. Farmers need to apply a little lateral thinking and imagination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that clause 5 will stand part of the Bill, because it is an essential part of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Baker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Basingstoke repeated the suggestion, which was no doubt put to him by those in the industry who have concerns, that the compensation scheme in clause 5 might not be introduced. He described it—no doubt using words that were relayed to him—as potentially a confidence trick. That is a serious allegation and must be answered fully. For my part, I believe in the Government's good faith in this matter. I have no doubt that the Minister will introduce a compensation scheme along the lines that are set out in clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an allegation has been made, however, it would be helpful if the Minsiter gave an undertaking that a compensation scheme will be introduced. Of course, for the reasons that have been given, it would be impossible
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0685">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
to give details now. It is, however, possible to give an undertaking to introduce a compensation scheme. I see no reason why the Government cannot do that, and I ask the Minister to give such a guarantee this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may be a standard parliamentary way of dealing with matters, but why does the first line of subsection (1) say "may" rather than "will"? No doubt the Minister will have a good answer. If he can clear up that point, we can knock it on the head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to put on record an assurance that the Government have accepted the principle of compensation. We also support the Bill, which includes the relevant compensation clause. It follows, therefore, that we will have to honour that commitment. We have dealt with some of the details of compensation. I have given the hon. Member for Basingstoke some reassurances about what we regard as reasonable and what we are prepared to consider. I will certainly be willing to reflect on other points that the hon. Gentleman made on how compensation will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the wording of the Bill, it is true mat compensation is discretionary. Compensation will not automatically be paid as a result of this legislation: there is an element of discretion. Legislation has sometimes had a detrimental effect on businesses, but no compensation has followed. There were several cases of that under the previous Administration. It is, however, important to proceed with the Bill. There is widespread support for it. We recognise that there are implications for those involved in the fur trade. We have, therefore, accepted the principle that there should be reasonable compensation. That is the Government's position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As the Bill takes away the livelihoods of a small number of people, it is important for it to specify a date on which it will come into force. The clause provides for prohibition and powers of forfeiture and entry to take effect on 1 January 2002. The purpose of the delay is to give farmers still in the fur farming industry an opportunity to adjust their affairs and to wind down their businesses in advance, should they wish to do so. The power to make a compensation scheme will come into force two months after the Bill receives Royal Assent. That provision enables the Minister and fur farmers to get on with dealing with the compensation issue well in advance of the date on which the Bill will take effect. I hope that the clause provides maximum flexibility for farmers to move out of the industry as soon as they wish and not to have to wait until the date on which fur fanning is formally banned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
