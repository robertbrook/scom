	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning. Hon. Members may remove their jackets for their greater comfort if they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now move to clause 15, and I note from the earlier debates that many of the matters covered in clause 15 are also covered in clause 14 and have already been debated. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will take that into account when debating the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 15</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>ORDERS UNDER SECTION 14: PROCEDURE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (North Essex)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 211, in page 11, line 14, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) Before the Secretary of State makes an order under section 14 he shall obtain an assessment from the Audit Commission of the impact on any business of the order he proposes to make, including—
	<ol>
	<li>any trading advantage that may be obtained by a best value authority or any trading entity with which it may be associated; and</li>
	<li>the benefits of such a proposal in accordance with section 3(1).'.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 212, in page 11, line 18, leave out 'and'.</p>
	<p>No. 213, in page 11, line 19, at end insert '; and
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>(c) including a copy of the application received by him under subsection (00) above, and</li>
	<li>(d) including a copy of the assessment provided by the Audit Commission under subsection (1A) above.'.</li>
</div> <!-- ul --></p>
	<p>No. 214, in page 11, line 24, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3A) Where an order under section 14 makes different provision for different cases, the period of sixty days under subsection (3) above shall commence only after it has been the subject of a hearing of a committee of both Houses of Parliament.'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of clause 15 is to apply some procedure to the orders in clause 14. The purpose of the amendments is to circumscribe those procedures to provide some control over the way in which the Secretary of State may exercise the orders under clause 14. The Secretary of State is required to consult under clause 15(1), but we propose to add a new subsection which is set out in amendment No. 211.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>354</span>
I fully anticipate that the Government will suggest that the requirement to assess any trading advantage is beyond the remit of the Audit Commission as is the requirement to assess the benefits of such a proposal in accordance with clause 3(1). Clause 3(1) deals with the fundamental tenets of best value: efficiency, effectiveness and—I have said them so often that I have forgotten what they are. [Hon. Members: "Economy."]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of adding the amendment is to avoid the situation where a local authority is given additional power to enter into a trading arrangement with another company and a cosy, anti-competitive relationship between them is created. The original purpose of open and competitive tendering was precisely to prevent those unaccountable relationships from forming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be a power in the Bill to allow the Secretary of State to allow new kinds of relationships and partnerships to develop, they must not confer an advantage on one contractor over another, permanently or temporarily. Otherwise we are opening the door to all kinds of improper relationships between a public authority and the private sector. Secondly, and this seems a simple and honest requirement, they should be for the purpose of achieving the objectives of best value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The onus must be on the proposers of any new power under clause 14 to demonstrate that it will achieve greater economy, efficiency and effectiveness, and is not just for the convenience of the council in question. The amendment would require the Audit Commission to produce a view on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After consultation under clause 15, the Secretary of State lays an order and is required under subsection (2) to set out his proposals as a draft order and to provide details of the consultation. We propose in addition that the Secretary of State should include a copy of the application received under a proposed new clause. My drafting may be deficient but the power under clause 14 will not be exercised unless a local authority makes proposals and applies to do something that it would otherwise not be able to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My proposed subsection 3(A) in amendment No. 214 does not refer to such an application, but where a change in the law is sought by a local authority, the draft order— and consultation on it—should include a copy of that local authority's application. As consultation is being made, it would then be possible to view the germ of the idea from first principles and understand the motive behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendment No. 213, we propose that the consultation should include a copy of assessment by the Audit Commission as specified in amendment No. 211. Thus consultees could see for themselves the basis on which the commission had decided that the local government function met the criteria of economy, efficiency and effectiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concern must be that, because the arrangements under clause 14 are not just for implementation but are a permanent feature of best value and because the primary legislation might be amendable at any time for an indefinite period, proper processes are in place to ensure that the power is used only for the purposes intended by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0927">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>355</span>
In our unwritten constitution, power is a fluid commodity. Sometimes powers not used for a long time become altogether unusable; but it is not unknown for powers brought into existence under one form of legislation to be used for completely different and unconnected purposes. It cannot be the Government's purpose to create powers so wide that they could be used for purposes other than best value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would ensure that the procedures governing orders under clause 14 were bound tightly to the original purposes of the Bill and would prevent businesses from pressing local authorities for a change in the law that would work to their own advantage and to the detriment of their competitors, the efficiency of the local authority function and best value itself. The onus would be on the Secretary of State to be convinced that best value was the prime and only purpose of a change in the law before it could be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Mole Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Being much older and greyer than my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin), I should like to thank him. I remember that when I was in London in the late 1970s, the private sector—particularly contractors for housing repairs and maintenance—had a hard time because of the virtual monopolisation by direct labour organisations in many inner London areas. Like my hon. Friends, I am concerned that this could lead to municipal trading—a point that I have raised several times but on which I have failed to get reassurance—or to a form of municipal trading, with preferential backing being given to a firm as a partner and backed by public sector money, to the detriment of other firms such as housing repair contractors. I fear that we could gradually slide back to a position of there being no contractors, as happened in Wandsworth, Lambeth and other areas in the later 1970s. I want the Minister's assurance that that will not happen. Purely and simply, will the Government act to prevent municipal trading, which effectively allows firms to be in partnership with the direct labour force?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Alan Meale)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government understand the concerns there may be about this group of amendments. The powers in clause 14 are, as the hon. Member for North Essex said, tightly focused on achieving best value. We concede that they are also far reaching and that they require a careful process of consultation and value. Clause 15 provides for this process of consultation, scrutiny and positive affirmation in Parliament. However, there is room for reflection, which is why we agreed at our previous sitting to consider whether there might be a role for scrutiny by a Committee. It may also be desirable to establish a non-parliamentary group to ensure complementary consultation requirements and scrutiny under the clause. Unfortunately, as the hon. Gentleman accepted, the Opposition's amendments do not meet that aim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise and am pleased by the Under-Secretary's concern. However, there are a few borders that he could draw at this stage: extreme among them is municipal trading. Surely he could make it clear now that municipal trading will not be tolerated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me get past the introductory remarks before answering the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 211 surprises me because the conditions that it lays down could not be achieved without an immense increase in bureaucracy. The Secretary of State would be required to obtain an assessment from the Audit Commission before exercising powers to make an order conferring new powers on best value authorities or amending or excluding the application of certain provisions in primary legislation, particularly to facilitate best value achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not envisage applications for individual authorities being the only route or even the most likely one for the use of clause 14 provisions. Possibilities were being identified in the paper prepared for the Committee of which I spoke, and ideas from the private or voluntary sectors might, of course, be submitted to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members are perhaps concerned about the way that orders made under the clause might affect private businesses. I can reassure them. Clause 15 provides for all interested parties to express their views during draft consultation: those representations will be considered by the Secretary of State before he make an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 214 fails to convince in its attempt to ensure proper scrutiny of clause 14 orders. It is difficult to understand why the provisions of clause 14(3)(d) should be singled out for extra scrutiny in this way. I made it clear in previous debates that it would not be used to allow for specific provisions for individual authorities. It allows for features of different types of authority to be taken into account in an order under the clause. The scrutiny procedure outlined in clause 15 provides for full account to be taken of local representations, which may inform how such differences should be reflected. It also provides for a thorough examination of any proposals in Parliament. I therefore hope that Opposition Members will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was quick. The Under-Secretary did not satisfy me on the key question of the impact of changing primary legislation. He said that amendment No. 211 is too bureaucratic. However, the alternative is that the Secretary of State will take action under clause 14, regardless of the consequences for particular businesses. The Minister for Local Government and Housing, the hon. Member for North-West Durham (Ms Armstrong) is shaking her head. I welcome that gesture: the Secretary of State will not act regardless of the consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will make a judgement, but we do not know how. We do not know on what information he will base that judgment: we suspect that it will be on the basis of how he is influenced. In that case, the consultation will have a purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0928">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>357</span>
The consultation, however, is not a neutral process. No one in the Government pays a blind bit of notice to the guidance issued by the Cabinet Office on how consultations should be conducted and reported. How often has a consultation been presented to the House which shows how many respondents said yes and how many said no, and also indicates the size and nature of each response? Such a consultation would attach weightings to, for example, representations made by voluntary organisations, based on their membership Currently, a two-man-and-a-dog operation that sends a response is counted as one representation, as is a trade union with millions of members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultations are therefore not necessarily scientific processes. However, the Minister says that that is the basis on which the Government will judge whether the matter is fair on the private sector, and whether it will create a level playing field for companies wishing to make provisions for local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr David Curry	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Skipton and Ripon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will not denigrate consultations too much, because we will shortly debate a part of the Bill dealing with council tax benefit. Every single respondent to a consultation on that matter was hostile to the Government's proposals. We would like the Government to take note of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, consultations have a role. However, changing the law will have an effect on the nature of operations and the relationship between businesses and local authorities. Such matters cannot easily be turned into an opinion poll and require professional assessment. I was disappointed by the Minister's response to amendment No. 211.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will explain to the Under-Secretary why we single out clause 14(3) (d) as requiring especially careful consideration. The Bill is reasonably comprehensible when it treats all local authorities the same. However—if my understanding is correct—in some parts it treats different authorities differently, and orders will be made specific to particular authorities. Authorities will therefore become hybrid cases. The Minister is beginning to swoon with—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Boredom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is probably right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An explanation is required. When we discussed amendment No. 156, we did not receive a satisfactory explanation of the need for different provisions in different cases. All we are saying is that some scrutiny procedure should be available in Parliament to justify doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the Under-Secretary was reading out his remarks I intervened to press my point about municipal trading. I sound as if I am harping on it, but I am doing so for a good reason. I am interested in the point at which a preventive limit should be set. The Minister paused from his reading and said that he would continue and that an explanation would follow. It did not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>358</span>
He finished reading and sat down. If I might interrupt further reading that is going on now so that he can hear the question, perhaps he could use this opportunity—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Jealousy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I can read from my notes, but I do not think I need to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Minister's definition of municipal trading? Does he understand that a partnership between the private sector and local authorities could effectively amount to a form of municipal trading? Why can he not draw a line now? He needs only to say that he has drawn such a line, to forbid the practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Member for Mole Valley that local authorities already have the power to trade with the private sector, particularly with respect to public duties. There have been several examples of that, some involving private sector firms that have been deeply involved in providing services locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the extension of trading powers beyond that would require careful justification. We will not rule it out entirely. That is as far as I can go in drawing a line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Under-Secretary saying that he would bring about changes to the Local Authorities (Goods and Services) Act 1970?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that I do not rule out the relevant matter at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>Clause 15 ordered to stand apart of the Bill.</p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 16</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>CONTRACTING OUT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 215, in page 12, line 6, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3) No order of the kind mentioned in subsection (2) above shall be made unless a draft has been laid before, and approved by resolution of, each House of Parliament.'.</p></blockquote>
Clause 16(1) provides for another order making power, under section 70 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. I can do no better than to outline the concern raised by the Local Government Association, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 16 allows for Best Value authorities to contract out certain functions."</p></blockquote>
That is encouraging. It continues.
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is unclear whether this will be used at an authority's request or in consultation with authorities. Clarification is being sought on this issue."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0929">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>359</span>
Can the Minister clarify it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the amendment is based on a misunderstanding of the aim of the clause. Clause 16 extends the application of section 70 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 to cover all best value authorities. At the moment, it applies to only some of them. Police and fire authorities and the Greater London authority and its functional bodies will not be captured by it. Section 70 powers in the 1994 Act are already subject to affirmative resolution procedures as set out at section 77(2). The amendment would therefore have no effect on the way in which clause 16 powers would be used and scrutinised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order to transfer the powers of the Secretary of State to the Welsh Assembly is being laid before Parliament today, but consideration is still being given to whether the powers in section 70 should be transferred to it. The final version of the Bill will need to be consistent with the outcome of those deliberations. Subject to that consideration, the amendment would simply establish the scrutiny procedures that already exist to govern the use of clause 16. In the light of that information, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that clarification. However, he did not clarify whether the powers will be exercised at the request of an authority, or in consultation with an authority. Can the Under-Secretary now answer that question, which the Local Government Association raised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the amendments will lead to a general debate on clause 17. Amendment No. 226 would empower local authorities and broaden the process that the clause outlines. I hope that its drafting would enable broad national specifications and allow authorities to trigger the process. However, the other amendments in the group would narrow the clause. Clause 17 gives rise to an example of the Jekyll and Hyde attitude of the official Opposition to aspects of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 226 is little more than a probing amendment. Our substantial proposals are in the second group of amendments to the clause. Amendment No. 226 would provide protection from malign Secretaries of State. The current wording of the clause would not curb the possibility of a Secretary of State reverting to CCT. Yet the official Opposition's amendments would limit the provision's scope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the debate will draw out the precise intentions of the Government and the official Opposition. In view of Conservative amendments' references to clause 3(1), and the definition of best value, do the Opposition accept that CCT was discriminatory and wrong?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If amendment No. 226 was accepted, the Bill would empower local authorities. Throughout our proceedings, Liberal Democrats have supported giving local authorities power, and not leaving everything to Secretaries of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>361</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is one of the most significant in the Bill, because the purpose of competitive tendering was to ensure that all contractors were treated equally and that any internal organisation—a direct service organisation or a direct labour organisation—competing with contractors was treated on the same basis. The clause refers to section 17 of the Local Government Act 1988, which explains a specified matter. Section 17(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is the duty of every public authority to which this section applies, in exercising, in relation to its public supply or works contracts, any proposed or any subsisting such contract, as the case may be, any function regulated by this section to exercise that function"—</p></blockquote>
this is the key point—
	<br><blockquote><p>"without reference to matters which are non-commercial matters for the purpose of this section."</p></blockquote>
It was the habit of many local authorities going through the competitive tendering process to arrange for their contracts to contain extraneous and irrelevant conditions. That would ensure that their own work force obtained the contract and that no private sector contractor would be bothered to apply. For example, if the company had any trading links with South Africa, that disqualified it from taking part—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Sally Keeble	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Northampton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities did not do that. It was well known that such action was outside the law and most borough solicitors would advise members of local authorities that they could not take such matters into consideration. The hon. Gentleman must produce examples, because what he claims is absolutely not true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was giving an example, but as the hon. Lady says that such things never happened, out of courtesy to her I will check my facts. The fact that she was so ready to jump to her feet suggests that she was ready to fall into a trap; she well knows that there are all kinds of examples. If she really wants me to look them up in the Library and recite them to the Committee, I shall do so, but I did not think that would be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as the hon. Lady claims, such things do not happen, the restrictions are perfectly justified, and they should stay. Section 17(5) of the 1988 Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The following matters are non-commercial matters as regards the public supply or works contracts of a public authority, any proposed or any subsisting such contract, as the case may be, that is to say—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) terms and conditions of employment by contractors".</p></blockquote>
Under clause 17 it will be possible for the Secretary of State to make an order that the local authority shall be able to decide what the subcontractor's union representation should be. That might become a relevant factor, so that local authorities that choose not to have subcontractors that do not recognise trade unions to negotiate on behalf—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman please go through his points clearly? Talking about union representation is rather fatuous given that the fairness at work proposals clearly set out the union representation procedures and
	<span class='label label-info column'>362</span>
then leave matters to the work force. Will the hon. Gentleman try again to find an example of abuses that might actually apply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can think of plenty of examples in which a local authority would be required to tender for a particular function.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The onus is on the hon. Lady to justify why these specified matters are relevant to local authorities, because it is the Government who want to change the law.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Oona King	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Bethnal Green and Bow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Lady in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are the terms and conditions and conditions of employment by contractors relevant to the selection of a contractor, provided that the contractor complies with the law? The hon. Member for Northampton, North said that the Government were changing the law on union recognition; she called it fairness at work. I remember when trade unions made things pretty unfair at work. What is the justification for relaxing the restriction? Let us suppose that there were trade union activists which a Conservative local authority did not like or want in its work force. That might create circumstances in which a local authority could have a blacklist of subcontractors who employed those trade union activists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is illegal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady says that it is illegal, so what is the purpose of changing the law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. All members of the Committee have been in the House long enough to know that they should not intervene from a sedentary position. If they wish to do so it is for the Member who is on his or her feet to give way, and unless that Member is called by the Chair he cannot intervene. Members must wait their turn, catch the Chairman's eye and make a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the reaction that is being provoked as it means that there is red meat in the proposal which at last some Labour Members welcome. They might actually want this part of the Bill, as opposed to the

rest of it, during discussion of which they have sat rather quietly, perhaps resenting what their Government are doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give my hon. Friend one small example from a local authority. Prior to the changes that ensured that non-commercial functions were not to be taken into account, when the street sweeping and dustbin service was put out to tender, the trade union side of the direct labour force did its level best to ensure that the conditions under which its members worked continued. Those conditions were lax, to put it mildly. Everyone had a second job, most people clocked on and went home; the force actually working was half what it should have been. Someone who was not known to the family, who did not have the right name and who was not white and male did not stand a chance of being taken on "the dust", as it was called. People had to be on the list, which was a dead-man's-shoes arrangement. That is the sort of thing that causes many of us deep concern because we have lived through it. We do not wish it to continue, or to return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Oona King</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms King</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with some of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Mole Valley. Is he perhaps also thinking of the expense in his own borough of Wandsworth where a refuse collection was put out to tender and in about two years it went from a public monopoly to a private monopoly, because no other bid was made? The estimated cost to die taxpayer was £2 million, which suggests that we need to find a middle ground between the two ideological dogmas that previously held sway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Essex asked whether compulsory competitive tendering was fair to one or the other. There is an example of CCT favouring the private sector, where the set level of profit on CCT contracts applies to the private sector but not to the public sector. The Government want those anomalies to be removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Mole Valley made a lengthy intervention and the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King) responded in kind. Interventions are not speeches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At last someone is making a case for a change in the law, instead of trying to pretend that everything in local government was marvellous until die Conservatives won the 1979 election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is just a short intervention. It is a shame that the comment by die hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow was inaccurate. She failed to understand that there was always a DLO price put up. That ensured that there was no cartel. If the hon. Lady contrasts the savings in real terms on a like-for-like basis, she will find that it was something like 45 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To continue with the list, section 17(5)(c) of the 1988 Act refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any involvement of the business with irrelevant fields of Government policy."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph (d) refers to "workers in industrial disputes". Subsection (5)(e) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the country or territory of origin of supplies to, or the location in any country or territory of the business activities or interests of, contractors"</p></blockquote>
Subsection (5) (f) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"political, industrial or sectarian affiliations".</p></blockquote>
Goodness me. It would be dreadful to go back to a situation where the only companies that contracted with individual local authorities reflected the party affiliation of the majority group on that authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (g) refers to support by contractors for any particular institution and (h) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the use or non-use by contractors of technical or professional services".</p></blockquote>
What is the justification for diluting any of those restrictions? When I suggested that they want to dilute these restrictions, Labour Members were ready to jump up to say that it would be illegal anyway. Why on earth should any of those restrictions be diluted?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 216 to 218 aim to ensure that any order under the clause is objectively justifiable in accordance with die fundamental duties. For example, a local authority may want to provide a service in order to employ more women. That might be a laudable aim but it raises a big question about the local authority's role. Is it a social employer or a provider of services? We would want to ensure that the provision of social employment is in a separate bracket from die provision of services. Problems arise the minute the two start to overlap. When local authorities were run as sources of social employment we got into problems of poor efficiency and delivery, high expense and bad value for the council tax payer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept some of die points about die local authority's role being that of service provider. However, would the hon. Gentleman not accept that a large commercial organisation, such as the local Asda in Surrey Quays, makes a big point of the fact that a certain percentage of its work force is recruited locally? It would be completely appropriate in such an area for the local authority to apply similar standards to its own contractors and such issues might be extremely pertinent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would accept mat, but with the proviso that it is compatible with the objectives of best value. What has tended to happen—it is not worth the hon. Lady giving me a whole load of examples as everyone knows what we are talking about—is that local authorities have made decisions about the nature or make up of their labour force regardless of efficiency. Indeed, they almost prided themselves on their beneficence as an employer, regardless of the provision of the service. That is not what Asda is doing. Its prime objective is to serve its customers. If, as a secondary issue, it can employ local people it is right that it should try to do so, as it would be for a local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>365</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The suggestion made by the hon. member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) is fine as far as it goes but when one reaches a certain level it could go against the best value authority, particularly if one is looking for an expertise that may not be competitively available within the locality. A broad sweeping suggestion such as she has just put forward could be detrimental.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend: that is exactly the point of the amendment. We are not just rampaging against the clause, but wish to ensure that orders pay heed to the duties set out in clause 3(1). I use the words "objectively justified" advisedly—they are used by the European Court of Justice in dealing with sexual discrimination, for example. Treating part-time workers, in another example, differently from full-time workers can be justified provided that it is "objectively justified". Here I am saying that any discriminatory employment provisions must be objectively justified in accordance with the specified duties.

Amendment No. 217 proposes a new subsection (1A) and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shall only make any order under this section upon an application from a best value authority containing a justification of the need for a new power, which shall have regard to the duties on a best value authority pursuant to section 3(1)"—</p></blockquote>
a reasonable restriction on the clause. If the Secretary of State is going to relax the restrictions in the Local Government Act 1988, a proper case should be made— as, for example, when a local authority makes an application. It should not emanate from some vague consultation, which might not suit anyone's purpose except that of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 218 proposes another new subsection (IB) and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before the Secretary of State makes an order under this section he shall obtain an assessment from the Audit Commission of the impact on any business of the order he proposes … including … any trading advantage that may be obtained".</p></blockquote>
That is an effort to maintain a level playing field for different contractors in different local authorities. The benefits would be assessed by the Audit Commission in relation to the Bill's objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I honestly do not think that the amendments are at all unreasonable. The provisions are about re-empowering local authorities, not taking power away from the Secretary of State. More discretions are being given to local authorities to decide what distortions they want to the contracting process. However, that should relate to the objectives in the Bill, not favour certain private contractors over others, and should be as limited as possible. For all the hunger of Labour Members for tearing up the provisions of the Local Government Act 1988, a proper case for relaxing any of its restrictions has yet to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting clause and it was interesting to hear the amendments proposed by the two opposition parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause reflects the Bill introduced last year by my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow, which had a smooth passage through this House until the
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
final stage when it was blocked by an hon. Member who was not content to allow any private Member's Bill through. However, in Committee, Opposition Members agreed with my hon. Friend's points and the Government were also pleased to support the Bill. Following those discussions, we were confident about including such matters in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) said that that changes part II of the Local Government Act 1988. Under that provision, local authorities have not been allowed to take into account certain so-called non-commercial matters in selecting tenderers and awarding contracts. That has advantages, as the hon. Gentleman says, as it prevents authorities from pursuing ideological idiosyncrasies at the expense of value for money. That is why we do not propose to repeal the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, part II of the Local Government Act 1988 also has manifest disadvantages, because it prevents local authorities from making a thorough and reasonable assessment of the quality and capability of tenderers. Important considerations, such as a company's training policy, have been off-limits simply because of how non-commercial matters have been defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that good procurement practice has moved on in recent years, especially since the Local Government Bill 1988 was enacted. It is therefore high time that the legislative framework was amended to reflect that. That is not just the Government's view: it is shared by local authorities and the private sector. I have already mentioned the private Member's Bill promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow; the Committee may remember the widespread support for that measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must move away from the position in which short-term gain is more important than long-term capabilities. Authorities must have confidence in their private sector partners, and private companies must be able to demonstrate that they are well run organisations, capable of fulfilling contracts and annually improving the level of service in a way that delivers efficiencies. The provisions of the 1988 Act are an obstacle to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 17 therefore gives the Secretary of State the power to remove categories of non-commercial matters so as to bring the framework into step with good procurement practice and with best value. Such power will balance the provision in the 1988 Act which allows for additional non-commercial matters to be specified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Essex got into trouble with his examples. However, I will put my toe in the water and use the following example: work force matters have been specified as non-commercial under section 17(5) (a) of the 1988 Act. Local authorities cannot make inquiries about a contractors's work force and management practices, even when such matters are relevant to the quality and value for money of a contract. That restriction does not apply to the rest of the public sector. As my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North made clear, the private sector does not impose such a restriction on itself when it develops independent activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One possibility is that we might consider using the new power to modify that restriction so that local authorities have proper regard to work force matters in cases in which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0933">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>367</span>
there are relevant quality and value for money considerations. However, any changes would be in keeping with our obligations under the EC procurement rules mentioned by the hon. Member for North Essex, and with Government procurement policy, which requires value for money contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will recognise that clause 17 must be used carefully and on the basis of broad consensus. That is why we welcome the helpful and constructive work done by the social partners, demonstrating that that consensus exists. I will circulate to Committee members the results of the social partners' recent deliberations and the agreements that they reached, especially on the clause's powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been reflecting on the Minister's comments about training, and confess to being mystified. I give as an example a local authority having a range of bidders for a particular function, and the skill of the work force being a significant factor in its efficient delivery. It might be obvious, or become so after investigation, that the cheapest bidder did not provide sufficient training to enable its work force to deliver the function well into the future. If a higher bid was ultimately accepted, there would be a referral to the Secretary of State to question why the lowest bid had not been accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But is that not the fundamental understanding of competitive tendering? The lowest bid need not be accepted if there is a sensible reason for not doing so. If the Secretary of State agreed, he would be able to wave through the award of the contract without punishing the local authority for accepting a higher bid. Or have I misunderstood? Flexibility is already there, but the provision would open the way to the sort of discriminatory contracting that existed before competitive tendering was properly regulated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that an authority does not automatically have to accept the lowest bidder. However, I suspect that evidence of an authority's dissatisfaction with training provision would be acceptable to the Secretary of State, and he would reject the bid. The issues are, how do we define commercial activities, and how can it be made clear that a defined area is relevant to an activity, even if in strict terms it may be defined as non-commercial? We seek a way forward. If the hon. Gentleman will be patient until I have done a little more, he will find that we are content to ensure that the power is used with caution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend gives a good example. One firm competed for a lot of grass cutting around south London, and usually tendered the lowest bid. Its contracts collapsed many times, and the only way people were able legally to detect and exclude them from the tendering process was by looking carefully at the number of staff that it employed and proving, after much careful effort, that that number of people could not cut that amount of grass. A much simpler and more honest approach that examined capability and training and so on would have saved local authorities millions of pounds and given a much better service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>368</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend. The Government recognise the need to use the clause carefully on the basis of broad consensus. That is why we have worked closely with social partners and drawn up certain types of agreement that they consider useful in moving forward. We shall have to consider this point to decide to what extent we agree with their conclusions. It is none the less encouraging that the CBI, the TUC and the LGA are working together on such issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make two brief points. First, the hon. Member for Northampton, North shows a lack of understanding of compulsory competitive tendering. If specifications are properly set, what counts is the requirement to produce the work, regardless of the number of staff, and failure to do so would mean a firm losing the contract. If, as I suspect, the firm that the hon. Lady had in mind is the one that I think it is, I confess to having contributed to its downfall, because it failed to produce the contract specifications and was withdrawn from the tendering process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the comments of my hon. Friend the Minister for North Essex, a local authority might set training standards that would be excessive for a local authority contractor. A small firm that was contracted to do a specific job might be required to meet a level of ethnic minority training, which was extensive in the local authority, but not outside. Such a burden on the firm could force it to withdraw from the contract. In such a case, competition, which the Minister emphasises, would not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being obstructive. If Conservative Members had read the clause properly, examined the debate on the private Member's Bill that my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow promoted last year, and listened to my speech, they would know that the Secretary of State's use of the powers in the clause will be carefully scrutinised. Nothing can go beyond the European Community's procurement rules. Councils that were unreasonable, and specified activities that were not relevant to the company's eligibility for the contract, would put themselves outside the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman knows the Secretary of State does not monitor every local government contract. It is not for the Secretary of State to decide whether training is relevant in a contract; it is a matter of law. Under part II of the 1998 Act, it is currently illegal to take training into account. An authority that did that could be challenged by the contractor and seen to be outside the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause simply provides for our law to catch up with modern procurement practices in good business. We want to ensure that modern procurement practices colour local authorities' approach to public-private partnerships, contracting and their relationship with the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public and private sectors have a lot to learn from each other. They must work together to drive up standards and improve services. If we bind local government practice by a contracting law that does not apply to the private sector or the rest of the public sector, we do not allow local authorities to catch up with modern procurement practices.

	<span class='label label-info column'>369</span>
Amendment No. 217 seeks to remove the Secretary of State or the Welsh Assembly's discretion to determine when an order under the clause should be promoted, and instead permits an order to be made only following an application from a best value authority on the basis of a justification of need, related to the general duty of best value in clause 3. I should make it clear in relation to all the proposed amendments to clause 17 that any use of the power should be on the basis of a broad consensus. That is consistent with the European directives and with the principle of achieving value for money. That underlies our approach to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 226 also relies on individual best value authorities to trigger action, and would thus narrow and restrict the power in an unhelpful and unconvincing manner. We consider that decisions about the use of legislative powers to bring the framework into line with good procurement practice and remove obstacles to best value should be taken by, and at the discretion of the Secretary of State, at a national level, rather than by individual best value authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the clause makes it clear that any order would already be subject to affirmative resolution procedure in both houses. Thus any proposal from the Secretary of State would be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny. The requirement additionally to bring a document before both Houses of Parliament to explain how a specified matter is to be treated is unnecessarily bureaucratic. Both Houses would hear the Secretary of State's view during the debate on the affirmative resolution. I therefore invite the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 216 seeks to provide that the use of the order-making power conferred by clause 17 on the Secretary of State should be objectively justified in best value terms. I understand the concern of Opposition Members about the additional powers being taken by the Secretary of State and about this specific issue. I am happy to listen to what the hon. Member for North Essex says as we are seeking to achieve the same end. However, the amendment is unnecessary because the clause relates to best value authorities. Therefore they cannot act outside best value in coming to an agreement with any other body, be it private sector, voluntary sector or other public sector in pursuance of the duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 218 would require the Secretary of State to seek an assessment from the Audit Commission on the likely impact of an order made under clause 17 before such an order is exercised. I appreciate that Opposition Members may be concerned that the power in clause 17 should be exercised with due care and attention—to coin a phrase—and with regard to possible consequences. I hope that I have been able to reassure them on that point. The power contained in clause 17 will be used to promote best practice in procurement and contracting. That will be to the benefit of both private sector businesses and authorities in achieving best value. The work of the social partners has helped us to see that broad consensus can be achieved in relation to the clause 17 provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we will not use the power indiscriminately or without taking on board other views. In fact, I am amazed that Opposition Members think that we would or even imagine that we might. We are well aware of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
importance of ensuring that clause 17 is exercised in the interests of best value. That also means that it is in the interests of good and productive relations between best value authorities, private companies and the voluntary sector. That includes ensuring that best value authorities operate, including when they are trading, within a framework of fair competition. That is inherent in best value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with any other piece of legislation, we want to ensure that we get it right. We will therefore consult widely before an order is made. We shall, as a matter of course, share our proposals with both the Audit Commission and the private sector, as well as local government and others, before anything is done. There will be no shortage of scrutiny in the exercise of the power. Consultation in advance of legislation is simply good government. There is no need for the Bill to make provision for additional scrutiny of the exercise of the power contained in clause 17. I hope that hon. Members are reassured and will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for her concerns and her understanding of our concerns. The point of my hon. Friend's amendment was to raise those concerns. The hon. Member for Northampton, North said that solicitors would have stepped in if any local authority members had tried to impose such ghastly, non-competitive conditions. She is essentially right because legislation provided that the solicitor, auditor, chief executive, monitoring officer or whoever was appropriate stopped individual elected members on the council from imposing non-commercial and sometimes outrageous conditions on contracts. My hon. Friend showed that the law worked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us remain concerned about attempts by local authority members to get round that legislation and I assume, because of the emphasis on the importance of scrutiny, that the Government accept the validity of such concerns. We will want to watch carefully to establish whether the reassurances that we have been given prove to be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some local authority members have become notorious. I could cite my favourite local authority, Barnet, which tried to get rid of the reasonable, well known and able contractor underbidding it, by concocting fictitious rules and regulations—even quibbling abut the size of the truck used by the contactor, ignoring the fact that the job specifications required it. Amusingly, the local Member of Parliament found himself jammed in the street because the direct labour organisation's truck was too large— precisely the reason Barnet council had tried to use to get rid of the contractor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have a good understanding of why the Government want to move down this road. We are distinctly concerned about abuse. Monitoring will have to be extensive and close. If the Government believe that real competition utilising the private sector should be used by local authorities, I must warn them that there will be attempts to ensure that the direct labour organisation has the upper hand to the disbenefit of those being served who have to pay for the best value service that they are supposed to be receiving from a supposedly best value authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 63, 64 and 65 are Government amendments to enable the Secretary of State to issue guidance to best value authorities following the exercise of the power contained in clause 17. The clause provides a power that will allow the Government to modify current restrictions on contracting, which take the form of specified, non-commercial matters in the Local Government Act 1988. The important point, therefore, is exactly how those matters should be specified in the context of best value. The hon. Member for Mole Valley raised that matter in an earlier debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not our intention to weaken the safeguards against abuses of contract compliance. On the contrary: we will promote best practice and value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Best value authorities must take properly informed decisions when selecting tenderers and awarding contracts. Current restrictions are an obstacle to that, preventing reasonable consideration of a contractor's work force policies, even when such policies are relevant to the performance and value for money of the contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 65 will enable us to issue guidance that will reinforce the value for money message, following the provision in clause 17 for the exercise of
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
power. In other words, the statutory guidance will act as a safeguard to ensure that best value authorities do not misunderstand the changes that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that Committee members may be concerned that clause 17 should not introduce changes that might undermine the value for money of local government contracts. I hope that the amendments provide reassurance on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment Nos. 227 and 228 are grouped with the Government amendments. In our consideration of previous clauses, we debated extensively how other matters feature in the best value regime. I know that that remains a concern to Liberal Democrat Members, so I will briefly restate our position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Best value is about delivering quality services at acceptable costs to those who use and pay for them. It is essential that authorities focus principally on service outputs and outcomes to enable local people and those responsible for audit and inspection to assess real performance and achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the effectiveness banner, we are examining national indicators which reflect fair access to services: that is equity under any other name. Those will be key indicators against which best value will be assessed, but they will not be the only ones. Local authorities will be free—indeed, they will be encouraged —to develop their own indicators, so far as they reflect the views and priorities of local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We fully accept the argument that quality services are more likely to be delivered efficiently and effectively if those who are employed to deliver them are treated fairly and considerately, are well motivated and well trained. I have heard about a private sector company seeking to provide additional training for what, in the past, were known as blue collar workers. Our fair employment agenda recognises such policy thrusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Race relations and equal opportunity will be similarly recognised. We agree, for example, that the Government and public bodies should take a positive lead in setting key targets for developing all their staff and in considering the impact of policies on those who are affected. We have done that in central government, setting ourselves targets on recruitment and involvement of ethnic minorities at every level of the civil service, not just the lower grades. We are determined that we will do what we can to ensure that fairness prevails in central government bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take the same view in the public sector generally. In statutory guidance, for example, we will ensure that authorities fully consider the impact of all options when reviewing their services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made clear our commitment to the principles of sustainable development. The White Paper on local government confirmed our manifesto commitment to place a new duty on local authorities to promote the social, economic and environmental wellbeing of their areas. We want them to play an active role as community leaders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new duty will put sustainable development at the centre of community planning. The principles of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0936">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>373</span>
sustainable development will underpin authorities' policies not only for the services that they deliver but for the activities that they undertake in partnership. Local authorities are already drawing up strategies under local agenda 21 that give effect to sustainable development principles. We have published new quality-of-life indicators that can be fashioned for local government also. We therefore have policies and plans to legislate in ways that will affect these other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prime focus of the best value legislation is on securing genuine improvement in the services on which people depend. We do not wish to dilute that process but we shall issue guidance under best value provisions that ensures that authorities link the implementation of best value with wider issues such as sustainability and the quality and values that they attach to their work force. Therefore, in our view, the amendments are unnecessary, and I ask the hon. Lady not to press them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disappoint the Minister but I intend to press amendments Nos. 227 and 228 because I am unconvinced by her answer, although I was fascinated at her ability to give me such a robust response before I had made my speech. This is where civil servants come in useful, I am sure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 227, seeks, rather than merely lifting a ban, to allow the Secretary of State to identify certain matters which local authorities and others would be required to consider. We have talked about equity and sustainability. I recall trying the first time to find three more Es: I could have used the word "ecology" instead of sustainability, but my brain works so slowly that it has taken me three weeks to work that out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, we have tried to have equity and sustainability written into the Bill. As the Minister has just reiterated, the Government have expressed support for the idea of local authorities considering the issues. The support was expressed but the Minister clearly does not consider those issues as important as the original three Es that are in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for equity and equality, the Commission for Racial Equality is convinced—no doubt the Government agree— that public bodies should be able to use the leverage of their purchasing power to help prevent racial discrimination and promote the adoption and application of good equal opportunities policies and practice by employers. I agree that there have been times—I hope that I shall not be required to be specific—when local authorities were more eager to put duties on outside contractors than on themselves, and have been tempted to use the procurement process to persuade the private sector to employ good equal opportunities policies while not necessarily carrying them out themselves. I am glad that there has been no intervention on that—I hope that hon. Members can think of examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission for Racial Equality argued that provisions in the Local Government Act 1988 which enabled authorities to ask specific questions and include draft terms in contracts, and then consider responses, did not go far enough. Local authorities used this facility variably because they considered that it had serious defects, such as not allowing authorities properly to assess
	<span class='label label-info column'>374</span>
contractors' responses nor requiring them to take action. The Minister, rather than seeing this as an exception to the rule which rather lowered the status—the CRE prefers to see it as part of the duty given to all public bodies— said that commercial considerations should not undermine value for money. Our view, which I am sure that the Government share, is that money should not be the only issue to be taken into account. This is where I suspect we differ from Conservative Opposition Members in that we consider wider issues also of importance. The public do not generally consider money the only issue to be taken into account, as is obvious from the pattern of voting in local elections. The party that promises the lowest council tax does not always win the election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Value for money is a different matter. Saying that money is not the critical issue does not detract from our determination to get value for money by getting the best quality and the most efficient service. That is one of the problems; simply saying that money is not the most important thing should not mean that we do not recognise that whatever money is spent, we must get the very best out of it for the sake of the public whom we seek to serve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no disagreement; I should have said that cost was not the most important issue and that value for money would take into account other issues. It is a matter of how value for money is defined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am at one with the Minister on the issue. It was only ever a caricature of competitive tendering that it was about the price of everything and the value of nothing. On the contrary, some of the first beacon authorities that the Minister may select will be authorities that have used the competitive tendering framework effectively. It is all about providing better value in its widest sense for council tax payers. That is why we share the Bill's objectives. We should not get involved in arguing about which of us has a certain view about value for money. We should be discussing how the Bill will work in practice rather than caricaturing each other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have rattled the hon. Gentleman's cage but I am delighted that there is an outbreak of sweetness and light in the Committee and that everyone is in agreement. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Obviously this is the third way; we are all in the same tent and all agree on everything, all the time. It is very dull. I hope that when the hon. Gentleman talks about value for money he includes matters such as the impact on the environment, on equity, racial equality, training the work force and the other issues that we have discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lady Thatcher made the environment an issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that Lady Thatcher would be distressed to hear that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about the service output and outcomes and she would agree that they are affected by input, the example being how the work force is treated. The Minister mentioned how the work force is motivated "etc." An authority may appear to score highly in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0937">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>375</span>
performance indicator charts, for example in the speed with which it deals with planning applications, but the outcome of its impact on the environment, for example, may be negative; its speedy response may have been at the expense of public consultation or of good design, so outputs do not necessarily measure people's interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the amendments, although I have not strayed far from them, only by specifying equity and sustainability in the Bill will it show that me Government attach high importance to these issues. The Minister keeps saying that such issues should be at the centre of local authority plans because the Government think that they are important, but she resists our attempts to help her to legislate to put real power into her avowed principles. I hope that she will not continue to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had representations from private sector interests that are suspicious of the clause, it creates an opportunity for cosiness between local authorities and some contractors and for the exclusion of new entrants.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms King</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that cosiness is necessarily a sin. However, it is wrong to prevent other contractors from having a fair crack of the whip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The CBI group of companies is not involved in the majority of public services for which bidding with local authorities is required.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms King</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman might be aware that the business services sector will be greatly affected by the Bill. That sector is specifically involved with local authorities. As chair of the all-party group on business services, I have spent a lot of time speaking to employers
	<span class='label label-info column'>376</span>
who have been involved in the social partner dialogue. I appreciate that "dialogue" constitutes a swear word for the hon. Member for Mole Valley, but when agreement has been reached, the Government should try to incorporate the views of the social partners so that we can progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government amendments would ensure that the contracting process was not abused, as it was in the past. We have witnessed outrageous public sector abuses of the contracting process. After die introduction of CCT, we witnessed outrageous private sector abuses. I have a list of the abuses that occurred in the constituency of the hon. Member for Mole Valley. I shall not go into that because it might prevent us from holding a constructive dialogue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current system encourages neither fair competition nor best value. We must escape the ideological, myopic viewpoint that prevents us from envisaging a way forward that would benefit the private sector and employees. Why is that coincidence of interests so terrible? The clause and the Government amendments would marry the compatible and interdependent aims of value for money and fair employment. Time and again, we see proof of the simple, self evident truth mat you get what you pay for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Work-force matters are not non-commercial. That is a double negative, but I mean that work-force matters have a commercial impact. That is self evident. I am delighted that the social partners have agreed that that is so. We now need legislation to reflect the changes in procurement practice and to prevent abuse of the contracting procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure must not be a barrier to business. It must ensure that there is no discrimination against whoever can deliver the service, whether that is the private, public or voluntary sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

However, she should ask the people of Barnet if they are getting what they paid for. The are paying £500,000 over the budget. The contract for bin services was £1 million over budget, compared with the private sector. The people of Barnet are not even receiving a service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I cannot resist giving the hon. Gentleman a horrifying example from 1996.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend spoke about the ruling out of competition.

Clause 17 will give another power to the Secretary of State. The Minister said earlier that best value was about outputs, not inputs. The amendment is about inputs, allowing local authorities the freedom to specify those inputs—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is shaking her head, but she should reflect on and accept what I say. We are talking about local authorities being able to specify what contractors shall do in order to achieve certain objectives relating, for example, to training or local employment policy. As I say, that means inputs not outputs.

I am always suspicious when the Government say that they will act in accordance with consensus. Ultimately, they are the arbiters of that consensus. The consensus could be the perspective of the CBI, which tends to represent big business interests. When the hon. Member for Northampton, North intervened on her hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow, she said that she hoped that many smaller enterprises would have the
	<span class='label label-info column'>378</span>
opportunity to contract for local authorities. However, I fear that in respect of specified matters in the 1988 Act, she is barking up the wrong tree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If smaller companies are able to do more work for local authorities, those authorities must split their contracts more—the worst offending authorities keep their contracts as large as possible to ensure that they are as difficult to organise as possible—but the clause has nothing to do with that. It underlines why the CBI supports the provision: the CBI supports big business, which likes big contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CBI also has an ambivalent attitude towards regulation—I hope that the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow is listening to this. Many CBI members favour regulation because it ensures that the big boys who can carry the regulation do much better than the small boys who can be put out of business by over-regulation. If local authorities create more regulation in their contracts, it could suit the big and not the small companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the public contractors association? It is difficult to universalise: there is definitely suspicion as well as enthusiasm about the clause.

The Government amendments, which deal with guidance, are interesting. The Minister said that guidance could be exercised after the power was exercised. However, Government amendment No. 63 does not mean that. It would allow the Secretary of State to issue guidance about specified matters in relation to section 17 of the Local Government Act 1988, which might be a better way of proceeding than altering legislation. For example, training of employees could be a relevant matter to consider when it will have an outcome on the performance of the contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ultimately one has to decide whether the contractor will be able to deliver for the price. It is no good just taking his word for it. It was never intended that the legislation should insist that local authorities take a contractor's word for it. If issuing guidance instead of altering the legislation made the atmosphere around the interpretation of those provisions more conducive to deal with problems, it might be a better way to proceed. I wonder whether the Minister feels that guidance should be used where alteration of the law might not be necessary.

The two Liberal Democrat amendments are interesting. Enabling the Secretary of State to specify a new matter to which the authorities will have regard is a most interesting way of proceeding. The Minister's rejection of that amendment rather blows the gaff on the pretence about die clause as whole. Amendment No. 227 is a mirror image of the clause as drafted. If the Secretary of State can remove a thing, surely that is like "having regard" to it. It is alright for local authorities to have regard for that specified matter. The fact that the Minister rejected the amendment raises a question as to what the clause is about. It does not make sense to reject amendment No. 227 and yet support the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to reflect on that again. If it is right for a local authorities no longer to be prohibited from having regard to what is currently a specified matter, why would it be wrong for the Minister to have a power to provide that local authorities shall have regard to specified matters. I do not understand that. The position is not logical from the Government's point of view which leaves a question mark in my mind about where die clause will lead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is incumbent upon the Government to allay me fears of uncompetitiveness that still exist, certainly in the minds of contractors, who feel that they will be squeezed out. I described them to the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow as cosy arrangements. We are in favour of cosiness but not of cronyism and protectionism—there is enough of that in local authorities as it is. We want to make sure that we do not create new opportunities for cronyism by passing such a clause without carefully questioning how the powers will be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, wish to emphasise the concern that many contractors share about cosiness and the difficulties they will have if the clause is abused. The Minister keeps telling us that competition is a vital part of the Bill. In fact, the previous clause talks about competition and is supposedly put in to enhance it. That has now been upset somewhat by die comments of two Labour Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northampton, North explained that die way mat the CCT legislation works means that the large contractors have a better chance than die smaller ones. She fails to understand that that is down to the local authority and the way it sets up the specifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow, talking about the private sector abuses in one particular local authority, mentioned health and safety. However, she failed to look a little further. Had she done so she would have seen that health and safety was used by that local authority to sack a large American catering firm. When the bid went out again the in-house team won. In other words the claim that there is a one-sided view of that local authority is disproved by its actions. I put it to my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex that at the end of the day we will have to suck it and see whether die private sector's fears will, as I suspect be realised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>380</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear mat mere will be plenty of private sector companies vociferous in defending their own interests, to the detriment of other private sector firms who may have been squeezed out. We will never have a clear answer because of the nature of contracting; there are always winners and losers, people able to stay on the inside under these arrangements and others who will be excluded. I hope that it will not be the small businesses to which the hon. Member for Northampton, North referred mat are excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, but he is only telling half the story. The contracts could be manipulated by local authorities if they are not monitored—I would love to see the army who will have to monitor the contracts. It would stop the private sector even being interested in bidding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned two contracts in one local authority that collapsed and said that that vindicates his arguments about CCT. Does he think that an adequate way to provide stable services to the local community is to have a regime that sets up contracts that fail? Is it not better to have a sound, best value regime that gives contracts that will last, be stable and deliver sound services at good value?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady fails to understand that only a small number of contracts fail. They fail because of their inability to reach a certain quality and standard. Allowing the private sector to compete through CCT has engendered an expertise and an entrepreneurship previously lacking in the provision of local government services. The quality of services prior to CCT and the local authority's understanding of those services was abysmal, and so were the costs. The hon. Lady knows that, because when she and I were in local government we shared borders with a local authority that was, and still is, notorious for incompetence and corruption. If the private sector had been allowed to bid properly with that local authority under CCT, and if it had succeeded in getting some of the contracts—it did in some other cases—the quality of services would have given best value. I think that the hon. Lady will accept that, albeit reluctantly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong our debate, but will the hon. Gentleman accept that the problems in that local authority were with management? Whether the services are provided in-house or not, if they are not properly managed, a private contractor can deliver a bad service too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right. Southwark's housing management and repair system, in-house and outside can be compared and contrasted. She might like to reflect on the fact that the outside firm was lambasted for providing in excess of 90 per cent, of the contract—not 100 per cent.—whereas the in-house team was barely providing 45 per cent, but was let off the hook. That shows an unpleasant bias, which I hope will not be reflected when the Bill is enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate, although the argument has not moved on much further.

The clause and the Government amendments will enable both the private and the public sectors to be much more involved in modern procurement practices. The Government want to ensure that local authorities adhere to the very best practices in the procurement and delivery of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) again raised issues that are currently covered by the three Es, which is why I say that the argument does not seem to have progressed very much. Her amendments would return the clause to specified matters rather than moving it in the direction that we wish. The effect of amendment No. 228, to which the hon. Member for North Essex also referred, would be that when the Secretary of State or the Welsh Assembly made an order under clause 17, which would provide for a specific matter to cease to be non-commercial under part II of the Local Government Act 1988, the order could provide for best value authorities to have regard to specified matters. The amendment would also increase the number of specified matters. I am not convinced that that is the best way of ensuring good procurement practice, which takes account of the nature of the work force and matters that are relevant to a specific activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example of modern procurement practice. The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) recently went to America to speak to the Mayor of New York, among others. The Mayor of New York favours a specific method of securing bidders for contracts. I spoke to a senior executive of a British street furniture business. He told me that the company had been invited to put in a tender for New York. That was a great opportunity. The company was not asked about the details of the contract or proportions and percentages; it was asked three questions. The first question was, "What values do you hold in relation to your work force?" The second was, "Can you deliver this service at nil cost to the city?" Advertisements were involved, and the company had to work everything out. The senior executive said that those questions had totally transformed his view of the company. The employers had had to work out with the work force the meaning of equal opportunities, and how the company valued its employees. That process has taken two to three years, but the senior executive claims that the company has emerged a more competitive business because it had previously never taken account of those matters. We should begin to view procurement practices more positively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause enables modern procurement practices to be introduced into contracting. The example that I gave is not the only method of doing that, but it reflects the experience of one company and one senior executive, who had been through a specific process. Current legislation is so restrictive that it does not allow that sort of approach. The clause alone will not achieve our aims, but it will help to move towards being able to consider more openly methods such as those that I described, and to consult more widely—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I gave an example of a very different method of proceeding in the relationship between a public body and a private sector company. That method tries to secure the best for the people of New York. I did not claim that that was the best way of proceeding in this country. It was simply an example of the way in which procurement practice has moved on since the 1988 Act was passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Hayes	<div class='memberconstituency'> (South Holland and the Deepings)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question is not whether wider considerations about a potential supplier should be taken into account as part of the relationship. That has always taken place. I have been involved with hundreds of contracts in business, and on the other side of the fence, in local government. The real point is whether they should be specified. The contractual relationship and the partnership are different things. The provision would load more requirements—for example, a more detailed specification—and would obviate competition and prevent some people, who might be very strong in terms of forming a partnership or relationship, from bidding in the first place and securing the contract.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was not present when we discussed the general thrust of the clause and I covered the many issues that he mentioned. The reality, of which the hon. Gentleman may be aware, is that current legislation forbids anything other than strictly commercial matters being taken into account. Our debate, prior to the hon. Gentleman joining us, made it clear that issues which at present would be seen as enabling and helping current activity were outlawed by the previous legislation. Clause 17 seeks ways through that without opening the gates so wide that his concerns would become a reality. They will not do so under the way in which the clause would legislate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady gave an illuminating speech after departing from her officials' notes—and that is not meant as a slur on her officials. A touch of the vision thing came through, for which I am grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On my earlier question about the use of guidance, will she undertake to reconsider issuing guidance on the specified matters, as a precursor of, or as an alternative to, legislating? It might be possible to issue guidance that would enable local authorities to have regard to apparently non-commercial matters in relation to the overall commercial imperative of getting a good value contract.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall, of course, take another look. My understanding is that current legislation is so restrictive that we cannot issue guidance on matters that current legislation does not allow. It would put the Government, as well as local authorities outside the law. We need clause 17 to enable us to deal with this matter effectively. I assure the hon. Gentleman that hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0941">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>383</span>
Members will be able to examine these matters through the affirmative resolution procedure of the House. We want to offer guidance to local authorities, and it is right that we do because some of them are small and, in themselves, without access to the legal interpretations that others have. I trust that the hon. Gentleman will accept that we are attempting to do this in a manner that moves us forward. Therefore, we believe that the clause is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our two amendments in this group relate to the timing of the commencement of the Bill. I do not understand the present arrangements. Clause 18(1) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The following provisions shall cease to have effect on 2 January 2000",</p></blockquote>
but it is not clear when the Bill will come into force. Our amendment is designed to ensure that there is no hiatus. We cannot see why the provisions of competitive tendering and the Local Government Acts as they are at present should cease to apply for three months before best value comes into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>384</span>
Amendment No. 219 suggests that the existing arrangements should simply fall away at the same time as these arrangements come into force. Amendment No. 15 therefore strikes out the part of the clause that is no longer necessary once that provision is made. This is only a probing amendment. I am sure that there are relevant issues which the Minister can address. I simply seek an explanation of why we do not have a seamless join between best value and competitive tendering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 229 and 230. Our amendments are the exact opposite of the Conservative amendments. I hope that the Minister's response will reflect the fact that there is not unanimity on the Opposition Benches on this. In her opening remarks at our first sitting the Minister said that there was widespread welcome not just in local authorities but in the private sector for the abolition of CCT and for the introduction of best value. Yet, if we follow the current timetable, CCT will continue and the spectre will continue to haunt local authorities. The timetable for the abolition of CCT puts unnecessary burdens on some councils for some services. Clearly not all local authorities and not all services will be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have accepted that CCT is a discredited process and they want its abolition at the earliest possible time. It therefore seems perverse to force authorities to let contracts under the CCT regulations in the next 10 months, especially as authorities are not sitting around waiting for best value to be put into legislation. They are already starting to implement it and we have heard examples not just from pilot authorities but from others that are welcoming the opportunity to get out of the straitjacket of CCT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has a particular impact on unitary authorities. Those which started on 1 April 1998 had exemptions from the CCT regulations for blue collar work in particular. Those exemptions end on 1 October this year. They will have to establish systems to meet the requirements of CCT from 1 October to 1 January—a three moth period— and at the same time prepare for best value. That is wasteful, time-consuming and benefits no one. The people in the authority who ought to be working on best value will be working for that period on CCT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have also argued that best value will allow the integration of services. We have discussed how that might work, for example across children's and other services. To use their buzz words—it would enable joined-up thinking. However, that will be difficult to achieve if the defined service areas are operating under CCT while others are under a best value regime. In those circumstances, the private sector may not even bid for contracts because of uncertainty over the length of the contract and the impact of best value. Continuing CCT for the rest of this year until January next year is not economic, efficient or effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 229 would bring forward the date for the cessation of the provisions detailed in clause 18(1) from 2 January 2000 to 30 September 1999, which would still provide plenty of time for Royal Assent. Amendment No. 230 would similarly change the date in subsection (2)(a).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that having to meet the requirements of CCT for a three-month period is a poor use of a local authority's resources. It would be better if an authority were advised to introduce a best value regime in advance. As I said earlier, many authorities are already doing so. If the date were moved forward, many autumn tenders—particularly those covering the new unitary authorities—would no longer be necessary and the authorities would have six clear months to prepare for best value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the ultimate sanctions on CCT are at the discretion of the Secretary of State, I fail to see the problem. Either the Secretary of State carries on enforcing CCT or he does not. Worst of all would be a complete absence of any discipline or regime because the Act had not come into force. This is the main problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would contend that the ultimate discipline on local authorities is the ballot box and that council tax capping and—this is dealt with later in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>386</span>

Local authorities already face such disciplines to convince them to obtain best value for their council tax payers, but continuing the CCT regime between this summer and January 2000 will not encourage them to provide it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

A question mark hangs over the small local authorities and parish councils, which we discussed during our second sitting, because of uncertainty over the 	<i>de minimis</i> level and whether they will be subject to it. Those smaller authorities will be in a hiatus, but the larger ones are already preparing for best value. Preparation would be more effective if authorities were not subject to CCT at the same time in the three-month period. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
