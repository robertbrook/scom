	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, Mr. Gale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 7 concerns the audit of best value performance plans. It sets out how the auditor is to be appointed and what he will consider once such a report is prepared. The principal issue that I wish to raise is contained in amendment No. 10, which concerns who the auditor is to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the private sector it is common practice to follow the Cadbury committee's recommendation and change company auditors on a regular basis. It is recommended that a public limited company should not have the same auditor for more than three years running. The auditor should then be changed because there is a danger of a cosy relationship developing between him and the company. Local government, however, is different because the Audit Commission and the district auditor are permanent features. The district auditor often audits local authorities ad infinitum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Best performance plans should be considered by someone who is distanced from the authority's operation. If an authority's auditor was to become involved with auditing a best value performance plan, that would be too much like an auditor auditing his own work. Amendment No. 10 proposes that clause 7(1) should stipulate that the auditor should be different from the one employed by the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>210</span>
Amendment No. 161 is a probing amendment and concerns provisions for the auditor's appointment in clause 7. We would like the Minister to explain the background to subsections (7), (8) and (9) so as to clarify the Bill's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 162 proposes that the auditor should not be a provider of consultancy advice, as that would lead to conflict. A situation may arise in which an auditor audits the authority's annual accounts and also provides consultancy advice on constructing a best value performance plan. If the auditor was then asked to audit such a plan, he would not bring the necessary freshness of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Experience demonstrates that district auditors, as a breed, can be reluctant to take up complaints about contracting and contracting out. However, auditors will be required to pursue such matters in the audit of best value plans. Complaints made to the district auditor about poor value in a local authority are often passed on to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. That is because such matters are regarded as political issues rather than audit issues. The Audit Commission is paid to carry out consultancy advice, and it is important that such responsibilities are kept separate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One local authority went through the process of letting a refuse collection contract, the lowest bidder for which was a private sector contractor. However, the council kept the contract in-house for the direct labour organisation. When the contractor complained, the district auditor simply claimed that it was a matter for the DETR, not the auditor. I shall not name the authority. It would be invidious to name public officials in the district audit office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The auditor should be independent if the person who holds that post is to assume a proper enforcement role. Amendments Nos. 10 and 162 would effect that, subject to clarification of clause 7(7) and (8).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mole Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current link between a local authority's auditor and the Audit Commission is fairly tenuous. It is a pay-and-rations arrangement. We have an opportunity to ensure that the auditor has a more hands-on role in best value. Therefore, it would be appropriate to have an independent auditor, with a more direct link to the Audit Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend's comments about a closeness—not a collusion—between local authorities, especially smaller authorities such as district councils, and local authority auditors. I do not believe that that is intentional, or that it happens in major local authorities, but a definite closeness exists. I shall give an example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I approached the treasurer of a local authority, which I shall not name. I had some links with the authority and I was disturbed by the way in which its budget was assembled. I was especially disturbed because that small local authority's balances were greater than the total revenue that it collected. The balances were so high that the authority seemed to be acting unlawfully. It was explained that the councillors wanted the balances to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0847">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>211</span>
high and that the treasurer was happy. I asked about the auditor, who had endorsed the system for a long time. I said that, as a council taxpayer, I would seriously consider taking the council to judicial review. When the relevant committee met, it received a letter from the auditor explaining that the authority should lower its balances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedure, which involved the same auditor and treasurer, had gone on for many years. The local Liberal Democrat-controlled council's bank account had huge balances when council tax payers would have preferred the money to be spent on services or to remain in their own bank accounts where at least some interest could accrue on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until the boot had been put into the closeness between the auditor and the treasurer, nothing happened. Without such action, the system would have continued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be an independent, new auditor, who can bring a breath of fresh air and different thinking to matters. Of course, that auditor should use some of the results, facts and figures gained from the treasurer and the council's auditor, but he should also be able to rattle the cages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many small district councils present their figures every year and claim that they are fine and in the middle bracket. But they are in the middle bracket every year. They make no progress; their performance figures show no improvement. There is currently no incentive for them to improve. My hon. Friend is right to propose the appointment of someone from outside, who can act without feeling impeded by any friendships that may have developed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Curry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Skipton and Ripon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is an auditor supposed to be doing the job that we are considering? Auditors check the probity of expenditure, they examine specific mechanical details; for example, if balances are low it may appear as if expenditure has been illegally directed. However, what we are considering is all about efficiency, economy and efficacy, or whatever the three Es are that keep appearing as a leitmotif in the Bill. If the purpose of the plan is to set out the way in which the authority will meet the relevant criteria, spend money more efficiently and meet certain targets, should not the job be given to experts in management rather than in auditing? Should not there be recourse to, perhaps, management consultants, or even a peer review body from within local government, rather than to auditors, who are not qualified for the job in question? I want to know why so great a burden has been placed on the auditing function, which is different from the management process that the clause seems to be concerned with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for North Essex said, the clause sets out in detail how an authority's auditor would report on its local performance plan and how that report should be disseminated. The auditor's report on the plan would be part of the rigorous process that we promised in the White Papers to check both the local performance plans and the management systems underpinning them. In that sense the right hon. Member
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>212</span>
for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) is right to say that the arrangement goes beyond what has traditionally been seen as audit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The auditor would have to report on whether the plan was prepared and published in accordance with clause 6 and any guidance. The report would have to state any amendments that he believed were necessary for the plan to accord with legislation and guidance, and recommend any action to be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause presents a range of possible actions to be taken by the auditor if he were not satisfied that the plan accorded with legislation or that best value was being achieved. In that case, the auditor could recommend that remedial action be taken by the authority, or, in cases of more serious failure, could recommend inspection by the Audit Commission or that a direction be given by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause makes provision for the authority's plan to be audited by an external auditor appointed by the Audit Commission. In normal circumstances, the best value auditor for any given year would be the auditor who audited the accounts for the previous year. That would ensure that the approach was consistent and that the person auditing the plan could provide a meaningful and informed check on provisional financial information that might have to be included in the plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we all understand the clause, and this is not a stand part debate. Our real interest is why the Minister feels that a totally independent auditor, who could quickly understand the service by using the figures and other material from the local authority's treasurer, chief executive and auditor, could not provide a decent and competent service, if not a better and more enlightened one—a fresh view, perhaps—than would be provided under the Government's proposal. The latter is not new Labour, but staid Labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, variety already exists in this context. The district audit service does not conduct all audits these days. They are conducted variously by the district audit service and the private sector. That results in moves, shifts and changes for authorities, but, as I have been trying to explain, while we are, I accept, changing to more than traditional audit, auditors in local government have traditionally had clear responsibility for value for money as well as probity. It is in that respect that we are asking them to expand and develop their activity, in the context of best value. The Audit Commission is currently working hard reviewing both the skills and the practice required to undertake this wider audit under best value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it the Audit Commission's intention to produce a list of approved auditors who have been through the course and who know what best value is supposed to mean in these terms so that we can have confidence that people hired by the local authority have the necessary training and are up to date with their new functions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Audit Commission will draw up a code of practice—a sort of itinerary that applicants for auditor under the best value regime will have to meet.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0848">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>213</span>
That does not mean that there will be an approved list; it means that applicants will be clear about what is expected of them, and know that they must meet those criteria if they wish to work in local government audit under the best value regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Opposition Members have said, amendment No. 10 would introduce the requirement for an auditor not familiar with a local authority to audit its performance plans. I understand what the hon. Member for Mole Valley attempts to say, but am not sure that I agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authority external auditors appointed by the Audit Commission have to be appropriately qualified as specified in the Audit Commission Act 1998. Although independent of an authority, they build a relationship with it and an understanding of how it operates, as the hon. Gentleman said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A key objective of auditing performance plans is to ensure that they are appropriate to the authority and to the requirements of its stakeholders—citizens, businesses, voluntary organisations and so on. The amendment would entail a second external auditor familiarising himself with the workings and financial circumstances of each authority. I understand that for many reasons the hon. Gentleman think that a good idea. However, it would increase fairly substantially both the burden on and the cost of the process to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the benefit of local authority plans being examined with fresh eyes, but our proposals far outweigh that. An auditor would be aware of the context in which the plan was prepared and, therefore, be better able to comment on it in the light of local circumstances. An external safeguard is provided in the best value framework by regular inspection and by consideration of fundamental performance reviews by the best value inspectorate, or other specialist inspectorates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We acknowledge the necessity for a fresh look at these matters by an outside eye. However, as we are already proposing an inspectorate, to accept the amendment would simply result in an overburdened, over-expensive and possibly bureaucratic method. The hon. Member for Mole Valley has at times argued against that, but now he appears to argue for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the one hand, the hon. Lady says that an independent external auditor would have difficulty learning an authority's circumstances on account of not being close enough, and so on, and on the other proposes an independent group from way outside that will go in and do exactly what we have suggested. Such a group would be further out, and less able to understand. The hon. Lady underestimates the ability of such people—be they from private sector or the so-called ex-district auditor system—to work closely and efficiently with local authorities. They will look at only specific performance details, so will rely to some extent on the opinions of the local authority, the council and the council's auditor. I doubt that there would be an enormous increase in expenditure. These people are extremely competent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman said that. He seemed to imply earlier that their collusion with local authorities was such that they were not doing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>214</span>
their job effectively. I am pleased that he has moved from that position. I understand his perspective. We believe that that is covered through the inspection regime and that the amendment is therefore unnecessary and simply imposes an extra burden. I hope that on consideration the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for North Essex for tabling Amendment No. 162, which raises important issues which go to the heart of probity and financial propriety in the best value framework. We are all anxious to ensure that scrutiny of local performance plans is carried out in an impartial manner and that auditors should not be in a position to carry out such work in a manner which may confer financial advantage upon themselves. It is for that reason that we have, under clause 8, placed the Audit Commission under a duty to produce a code of practice for best value audits, and obliged best value auditors to abide by it. I hope that that covers the issue that the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code will cover those issues such as probity, good practice and the application of professionally recognised standards which hon. Members are concerned about. The code is the right place to deal with these issues, rather than the Bill. In providing for this, we have followed closely the successful precedent of the Audit Commission Act 1998, and I am confident that we will achieve a similar degree of protection for all interested parties in this Bill. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw this amendment too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, throughout our debates, heard much about the need to safeguard the interests of the public. The creation of an effective, rigorous and fair system of audit is central to that. Amendment No. 161 is, therefore, both surprising and disappointing, although I understand that it is a probing amendment. It seeks to remove the powers which would allow the commission to produce a code of practice for best value audits, and a requirement for auditors to abide by it. It would therefore remove many of the things that I have been talking about and would remove the means by which consistency of treatment of best value authorities can be achieved. That is not fair to the authorities or the people they seek to serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment also seems to remove the provision in clause 7(7), which provides for continuity in vest value by requiring that the best value auditor will be the same person who audited the authorities' accounts the previous year. We have introduced that provision for the sake of continuity but also to ensure that the best value auditor, in working with unaudited financial data in the local performance plan, will be able to apply his historical knowledge of the authority's financial circumstances to supplement the material with which he works for best value purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, that addresses an issue that the hon. Member for Mole Valley raised earlier. He is concerned that performance data in the performance plan may be well out of date if it is simply the audited material. We want councils to include more recent data in the performance plan. Having the person who audited the accounts looking and commenting on that will help continuity and will also help to assure the public that things are working effectively. It might help the Committee to know that the Audit Commission, as well as introducing in the code of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0849">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>215</span>
best practice, will instigate regular quality controls of the auditors to ensure consistency in respect of quality and best value. I hope that the hon. Member for North Essex will withdraw the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister help with a point of detail on timing? The financial year runs from April to April, but when does she expect the performance plan to be voted on in the council—before or after the financial year starts? The auditor has to report by 30 June, a quarter of the way into the year. June is followed by July and August and the Minister will know that trying to elicit replies to consultation from local government in those months is an impossibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the auditor then asks the Secretary of State to intervene, we will then have two pretty dead months, and before we know where we are we will be six months into an existing performance plan before the council even knows that the plan is inadequate and will need to be revised. When does the Minister expect the plan to be established by the council? Is she satisfied that having the auditor's review of the plan by the end of June is not too relaxed a timetable? If action is pursuant to the review, is not the holiday season too far down the road in the financial year to have a reasonable chance of pulling the plan back?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have to find a balance between ensuring that the process is rigorous and enabling councils to take proper action if the auditor is dissatisfied with the performance plan, which has to be published by 31 March. I understand the problem mat the right hon. Gentleman is talking about, but I would not expect an authority to delay matters beyond the summer recess, if they have one—some do and some do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, a bad report on the performance plan in June will require councils to demonstrate that action is being taken, otherwise they might be in trouble from other quarters. We want to ensure that councils themselves are responsible for taking action to reassure the district auditor—or anyone else with an interest, such as the public and the inspectors if they are around—that necessary steps are being taken. Delay will not be in their interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That last exchange was about dates, and I suspect that the Secretary of State will use powers under subsection (6)(b) to bring forward the date by which the auditor should expect to receive a report as set out in subsections (1) to (4). It will be interesting to see how it works in practice. My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon has hit on an important matter for the Minister to consider, perhaps on Report.

Regarding the probing amendment No. 161 and amendment No. 162, I am simply not convinced by what the Minister said and I ask her to reflect further. She said effectively that the auditors of annual accounts and best value plans will themselves be checked on by the Audit Commission to ensure that they are complying with appropriate codes of practice. However, as in the private
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>216</span>
sector, the auditors should audit each other's work and, by having different auditors to do so, they will catch each other out. Whether or not they are professionally qualified, there is a tendency in human beings, if they discover a mistake that they made last year, to attach less importance to that mistake than they might have done had the mistake been made by someone else. That is why there should be a different auditor for performance plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The private sector does not have an inspection regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why rely entirely on a bureaucratic inspection regime when, by creating the right regulatory framework, the need for such intervention would be reduced? The hon. Lady said that we need not worry about the performance plans because there will be inspections under clause 10 when people are not satisfied, but why wait until things are further down the track? Why not include the safeguards, protections and transparency as early as possible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will not waste time on unnecessary divisions, but I ask the Minister to reflect on the issue raised. She gracefully acknowledged that there is an issue to be considered and the Department has obviously thought about it already. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are designed to ensure that auditors reflect on an authority's adherence to the principles of best value, as well as to the performance plan. Subsection (6) does not reflect the best value principles and thus it is not clear whether the audit will make any reference to those principles and, consequent upon that, whether auditors can pick up on an authority's failure to follow equal opportunities principles, for example, or to act in a sustainable way. The importance of the matter should be reflected in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even more importantly, the proposal fails to pick up on the duty to consult, which is a central plank of the process. Although as previous discussions have shown, the Government do not view the duty to consult as a central plank of best value, it should be part and parcel of the auditing process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The submission of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy to the Select Committee showed that there is anxiety about the proposed role of the auditor in identifying failures of substance and the auditors' expectations in that respect.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We share the concern that the Bill's objectives should be reinforced at every opportunity and in that respect we are sympathetic to the amendments. We want the Minister to say that the amendments are superfluous because the objectives are well entrenched in the Bill, that it will not be possible, for example, for a performance plan to fail on that count and that, therefore, the amendments are unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could simply give the hon. Gentleman that assurance, but perhaps I should go into more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Compliance with the general duty of best value is implicit in the legislation on preparing the local performance plan. The auditor's power to make recommendations on best value performance plans is designed to ensure that those plans deliver the kind of plan required to facilitate delivery of best value. If a plan is not prepared in compliance with clause 3, the general duty of best value, it is hard to imagine how an auditor could certify it as being a best value performance plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. members should remember that the performance plan will need to contain a statement of the manner in which the authority is balancing its objective to take account of the three Es, how it is complying with the duty in terms of standards and targets, and how it will set out plans for and outcomes of reviews. It is also important to remember that the auditor will be certifying the process that the authority has gone through to produce its plan. The process implicitly requires the authority to meet the duty of best value. It is unnecessary to adds specific references to clause 3 at this stage. However, if the process does not comply with the best value principles laid down in the Bill, the auditor's powers are robust enough to ensure that the plan complies with the duty of best value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that will reassure hon. Members that the duty of best value is central to the performance plan and that the amendments are therefore unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not take up too much of the Committee's time on the first few amendments as they are the first tilt at the powers to be given to the Secretary of State under clause 13. We shall discuss the matter more fully in our substantive debate on that clause, which, because it gives the Secretary of State powers to make directions, is probably the worst part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 147 gives us a chance to probe the Government's intentions in clause 13. Is it their intention that the scrutiny of best value should rest with the people, or with the Secretary of State? The Government do not seem to have much faith in the democratic process if they feel that they have to overturn, in a heavy-handed way, what may have been a recent vote by local people or the result of the consultation process in which they expressed their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 94 is probably the most substantive amendment of the group. It provides that if the auditor's report recommends that the Secretary of State makes a direction and the authority has to prepare a statement of the action it intends to take and the timetable within which it will implement that action, the statement should be debated at a meeting of the full council by all members of the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members know from debates elsewhere, we are most unhappy about the proposal for single party cabinet committees in local government. It raises the spectre of such an important statement being debated behind closed doors by such a group. There should be proper scrutiny by the Opposition, the ability to ask questions and debate the issue, and public scrutiny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) said, the amendment starts the trail that leads to the all-important clause 13, under which the Secretary of State can take the most draconian actions to deal with any shortcomings, starting with a shortcoming in a best value plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4)(f) underlines the importance of best value plans because they have recourse to the Secretary of State's powers under clause 13. We understand where the Liberal Democrats are coming from: they do not think that the Secretary of State should have any powers, and they are entitled to their view. However, it is important to point out that this is the beginning of the draconian part of the Bill. The Secretary of State will be empowered to determine authorities' practices far more widely than under the competitive tendering scheme, and on a comprehensive basis in terms of the functions that are under scrutiny. There has to be a fallback position. The onus is on the Minister to justify, especially to her hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0851">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>219</span>
Friends, giving the Secretary of State recourse to those powers at such an early stage—ostensibly before anything has been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support the idea of reports being published. Government amendment No. 56 states:
	<br><q><p>"A best value authority shall publish"</p></q>
a report in accordance with clause 7(5)(a). We also have sympathy with Government amendment No. 57, although we have our own ideas about what action a local authority should take when it receives a statement advising it that the best value plan does not comply with the Bill's objectives. We shall come to that on a later amendment in a different group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point is that the Minister should justify the draconian powers in clause 13 being available to the Secretary of State at such an early stage, almost before there has been proper discussion between the DETR and the local authority about the best value plan. It is extraordinary, especially given the noises that the governing party made about competitive tendering. The Bill was advertised as the abolition of competitive tendering Bill, but this suggests that competitive tendering is not being abolished, rather that the Secretary of State will be enabled to use the powers under competitive tendering more widely and comprehensively man before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Lady reflect on one question? What will be the position when a Conservative Secretary of State is once again in Marsham street, exercising the powers? The hon. Lady may think mat she is legislating for her Government, whose popularity in me polls may have convinced them that that is all they ever need think about, but it is unwise of a Government to legislate on the basis mat they will be in office permanently. The hon. Lady must ask herself how a Conservative Secretary of State would exercise the powers. If we were in office again we would use them to pursue competitive tendering. Everything is mere and, what is more, we could begin at an extremely early stage in the process, virtually before the ink had dried on me plan—even before the financial year had begun if the Secretary of State pulls forward the date by which the auditor must send him the report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The thought has just come to me that perhaps the Minister trusts a future Tory Secretary of State more than he trusts existing Labour councils. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was suggesting mat perhaps the Minister trusts a future Tory Secretary of State rather more than she trusts existing Labour councils, and that perhaps that is what tins is all about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Either way—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I think that the point was against the hon. Lady, not against me.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>220</span>
The Minister must justify why the draconian powers under clause 13 should be available at such an early stage in the best value process. That speaks volumes about all this flexibility she keeps talking about. The flexibility is with me Secretary of State when he wants to start clobbering the Council in question. We have views about a great many hugely inefficient Labour-controlled local authorities and my hon. Friends, particularly those who served as Ministers with responsibility for local government, may look lustfully at these powers. They were constrained in office by the rather modest legislation that was in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Clause 13 has been mentioned a couple of times during this debate. We shall come to clause 13 and debate it very thoroughly at the appropriate time. I understand that clauses are linked and some reference must be made occasionally to other clauses, but I would prefer it if we did not embark upon a debate on clause 13 now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Jon Owen Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure you, Mr. Gale, that I have no wish to debate clause 13 in advance. I do not intend to refer it in my speech other than in passing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government Amendment No. 56, which is grouped with amendment No. 147, is an amendment to clause 9 which will improve the accessibility of the reporting process to stakeholders. It may be helpful if, with your permission, Mr. Gale, I circulate a copy of clause 9 as it would look taking into account amendments Nos. 56 and 57.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the Minister is seeking to do this for the convenience of hon. Members, but ordinarily, if papers are to be circulated, they should be placed in the Room in the appropriate fashion and not circulated during the debate. Exceptionally, and I mean exceptionally, I am prepared to allow it to happen on this occasion if it proves to be for the assistance of hon. Members. I would not wish it to become a habit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My thanks, Mr. Gale. We will circulate papers in advance if required in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 56 requires best value authorities to publish any report received following the audit of their local performance plan whether or not the report recommends that the Secretary of State or the Welsh Assembly give direction. It also triggers the requirements to prepare a statement of action in response to any type of recommendation in the auditors report and incorporate it in the next local performance plan. As previously drafted, such statements were required only where the report contained a recommendation for a direction by the Secretary of State under clause 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government Amendment No. 57 will ensure that authorities include a statement in the next performance plan where any type of action has been recommended by the auditor. Previously, the requirement for such statements to be prepared applied only to recommendations for intervention and enforcement by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0852">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>221</span>
Secretary of State or the Assembly. The amendment will ensure that stakeholders are aware of all types of action being proposed by their authority to put right any shortcomings that have been detected, whether of substance or process. The amendment does not alter the previous provision where authorities are required to send their statement to the Secretary of State only when the audit report recommends that a direction is issued under clause 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendments Nos. 56 and 57 will largely overtake amendments Nos. 147, 148 and 149 and so I cannot accept those three amendments. I shall deal with amendment No. 147 first. If the options available to the auditor are limited to recommending changes to the performance plan or recommending that an inspection is carried out, it will deny him the full range of tools which we believe are necessary to carry out his functions. The auditor will not be able to guarantee compliance by an authority that has wilfully failed to comply with the legislation and guidance on the preparation of performance plan whereas the Secretary of State can, and in extreme cases, the auditor will need to be able to recommend that the Secretary of State takes steps to ensure compliance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does an auditor know whether somebody has wilfully failed? It is possible to fail to do something, but the Under-Secretary clearly said "Wilfully failed"—in other words, take the decision to fail. How is an auditor supposed to know whether a local authority has wilfully failed to do something as opposed to simply being incompetent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that auditors who are, by virtue of their profession, careful and guarded people, would not wish to use the word "wilful". However, it is possible for local authorities deliberately to fail to comply with guidance, although they would presumably not admit to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But how does the auditor find that out? How does he establish that an authority is not just incompetent but clever enough deliberately to decide not to comply? How does the auditor decide whether to send the report to the Audit Commission—a small smack on the back of the hand—or to the Secretary of State, which is a kick in the backside?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have already conceded, it is unlikely that auditors would use the word "wilfully", but by virtue of their experience they would be able to judge the degree of incompetence or deliberate action and make recommendations accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary said that the auditors would know by virtue of their experience. It was conceded earlier that auditors' experience lies mainly in examining costs rather that auditing the process. Here we are talking about the process of performance plans, not financial issues, so where will the necessary experience come from—particularly in the first few years—to enable them to start a process that will bring in the draconian powers of the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>222</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not legislating for what might happen in only the first or second year of operations; we are legislating for best value—a process by which local authorities drive up standards over the next decade and perhaps beyond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for amendment No. 148, without a copy of the auditor's report on the plan, the Secretary of State would not be able to intervene. The auditor's or inspector's report will be the principal source of objective information to the Secretary of State or Assembly on the way an authority is implementing the best value regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 149 seems to be flawed in its practical application as well as in its intent. The amendment would mean that the Secretary of State was sent a copy of all statements that would increase the administrative burden on him or her. The Secretary of State or Assembly will receive feedback from the Commission on the overall performance of authorities that are failing and it would be unnecessary for him to receive a copy of each statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have explained, Government amendments Nos. 56 and 57 to clause 9 will largely overtake this amendment as they will require all best value authorities to publish the auditor's report and then to prepare a statement of how they will respond to the report. Copies of the statement would be sent to the Secretary of State only in cases where intervention was recommended. I therefore ask that the hon. Member withdraws the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider amendment No. 138. Useful lessons and best practice will emerge from the audit and inspection processes. The Audit Commission and bodies such as the Local Government Association's new development and improvement agency will distil and publish key messages from the best value framework. The Audit Commission proposes to
	<br><q><p>"identify what works, to inform policy nationally and practice locally",</p></q>
as one of the key principles in its recent public consultation, which was entitled, "Developing principles for public inspection". It would be preferable for the Secretary of State or the Assembly and others to receive informed analysis of the outcome of audit and inspection, rather than a large number of reports on individual authorities, as amendment No. 138 suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 94 proposes that the external auditor's report should be debated and approved by the authority. It is vital that authority members know the contents of the plan and the auditor's report, even if it does not recommend action by the Secretary of State. However, it is not appropriate for a recommendation to be approved by the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 151 would remove the provision whereby the reports of the Audit Commission's inspector's are sent to the Secretary of State or the Assembly when there is a recommendation for the Secretary of State or the Assembly to issue a direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary said that it was not appropriate for the authority to approve a recommendation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Under-Secretary know what he sounds like? The report may be highly critical of a local authority's conduct, yet the Under-Secretary claims that he does not wish to overburden the authority with an obligation to take a view on the matter. That is extraordinary. He should say that it is vital that local authority members respond to the report. His extraordinary comment reveals that best value is about bypassing council members. The process is one of audit, inspection and, ultimately, enforcement by the Secretary of State. It has nothing to do with local authority members, who are responsible for providing the services. The Under-Secretary has given the game away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To quote from an earlier debate, the hon. Gentleman wilfully wishes to misunderstand the process. Of course, it is important that local authority members and their constituents know how the authority is performing. However, if the auditors provide clear, objective evidence of a need to perform differently, that verdict should be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the problems with the Under-Secretary's comments is that data on which the report is based will be out of date. The local authority might have acted on the data on which the performance plan was based on and which the auditor was commenting, and have rectified the difficulty, without, as the Liberal Democrats have suggested—it is painful to support them—being given an opportunity to make it clear that it had learnt from its sins, or that the incompetent Liberal Democrat-controlled council had been tossed out at an election in the meantime, allowing a decent Tory council to sort out the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raised the question of delay in the report, which we have dealt with previously. The delay will be the minimum practicable. Debate will not be prevented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a responsibility on local authorities to act on the recommendations that the auditors make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 151 would remove the provision for recommending that the Secretary of State or Assembly give a direction. The Amendment would leave no mechanism to trigger swift and rigorous remedial action. The inspector's report would be one of the key pieces of objective information that the Secretary of State could consider when deciding whether it would be appropriate to intervene. Objective information would enable him to make consistent decisions about intervention and that in turn would reassure and protect authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will ensure that local stakeholders have access to information to enable them to hold best value authorities accountable for their performance. It also
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>224</span>
provides for the Secretary of State or Assembly to be sent those reports that recommend that a direction be given under clause 13.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the current state of play in local government, and current levels of efficiency, which the Under-Secretary has had 18 months to review, how many times a year does he expect the Secretary of State to have to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The word "wilful" was used in connection with the notion that councils would choose to frustrate me process of providing good quality services and best value. It was suggested that that would happen not through incompetence or lack of diligence, such as has sometimes been shown on the Labour Benches in Committee, but through a wilful decision. That caricature suggests a way of thinking about local democracy that is prevalent in the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we heard the extraordinary suggestion that the local authority's power to comment on, debate or respond to the independent and objective report—I make no judgment about its objectivity—would be limited. Democratically elected local representatives would not have the power to respond to the auditor's judgment about their decisions, wilful or otherwise. That is a negation of the very principles of local democracy and good local government. I have attended many local authority debates at which the auditor's letter in relation to local authority services has been discussed. It is a matter for proper consideration, comment and scrutiny. The Bill will turn back the clock and return us to the days when central Government had enormous power over local affairs without reference to elected local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave the game away when he said that the Government would appeal over the heads of local people to stakeholders. That is the model for this Government. As they go over Parliament's head by appealing to focus groups and opinion polls, so local assemblies will be sidelined. That is chilling. We have seen the Government's real face behind their approach to local government, and learned exactly what they think about local democracy.

direction-making powers under clause 13, so I will focus on amendment No. 94, which has provoked the most debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that local authority members must be aware of the auditor's report, even though they may not necessarily be given a copy. However, it will not be appropriate for the authority to debate a recommendation in the report. We disagree: it is essential that the authority debate the auditor's recommendation. Legislation may, however, prevent such debate changing the auditor's recommendation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I correct the hon. Lady's misapprehension? There is no question of preventing the local authorities from debating the auditor's proposals. However, local authorities should not have the power to approve or disapprove the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would require the local authority to debate the auditor's recommendations in full council. There is a great danger that the Bill will drive a further wedge between local and central government. Central Government is taking on even more powers than it had under the Conservatives. Such a process could lead to a complete divorce when an authority is at loggerheads with the Secretary of State over recommendations in the auditor's report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 94 does not simply refer to debate. It mentions
	<br><q><p>"the statement and report for debate and approval".</p></q>
The Government have difficulty with a council approving or disapproving a report that has been objectively set out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I to understand that the Minister would be willing to support an amendment which proposed that the report should be debated and that the statement made by the authority in response should be debated and approved? It would be acceptable for the report to be merely debated because it is a factual statement and so cannot be approved or disapproved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will draw another parallel with the private sector. When auditors frame a report on a company's business, the board of directors make a minute, stating that it has examined the report and accepted its findings or asked for those findings to be reconsidered. It would be ludicrous for it not to do that. However, the Minister's comments reveal that once the best value audit process has started, ordinary members of the Council are out of the loop. We seek an improvement on the best value process and the Under-Secretary talks about consent and involvement, but they are distinctly lacking from this part of the process. Consent may be gained by the board—as we will find later in the Bill—but improvement and involvement should be an important part of the best value process. If the hon. Lady chooses to divide the Committee on this amendment, we might well support her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his helpful intervention.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 159, in page 6, line 44, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'() if appropriate, recommending how it should be amended so as to take into account any relevant information concerning the performance and financial outturn of the immediately preceding financial year.'.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 160, in page 6, line 44, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'() stating whether he believes that it conforms to any relevant model for best value performance plans issued by the Audit Commission.'.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These two simple amendments would improve the relevance of the audit of best value plans to the operation of a council whose members would have more information to act on. The audit overlaps the end of the financial year. There is an assumption in amendment No. 159—I accept that it may be ambitious for many local authorities—that regular management and financial information will be available in a matter of weeks so that it can be included in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider an example. The performance of a leisure centre being run by a local authority could be sensitive to economic conditions, the weather and other factors and it might be clear at the outset of the financial year that it is underperforming. If it is also the subject of a best value performance plan, which is being audited, information from it would be highly relevant to the authority's business plan for that function later in the year. The auditor should be required to take such information into account—the simple purpose of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 160 is more a question to the Minister. We understand that a best value performance plan will also be laid down by the Audit Commission and that a model plan will be established. The amendment would ensure that the report states whether the auditor believes that the performance plan
	<br><q><p>"conforms to any relevant model for best value performance plans issued by the Audit Commission".</p></q>
We believe that that will be the case and that what appears on what page will be prescribed so that the information is properly ordered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, what else will be in this model? For example, will it prescribe, as with competitive tendering, a rate of return on assets? Under the present legislation, the Secretary of State can determine a rate of financial return on the assets in a function carried out by a direct service

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>227</span>
organisation or a direct labour organisation. In a best value performance plan, is the Audit Commission likely to lay down such a requirement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have performance indicators and performance standards, but will other requirements be laid down informally in the best value performance plan which will nevertheless be benchmarks to which the auditors of the best performance plan will be working? Would it be unreasonable to suggest that there should be a 5 per cent, return on assets in a best value performance plan? How the Audit Commission will supervise the audit of best value performance plans is still a mystery and I should be grateful if the Minister could explain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have gone the rounds on an aspect of this date difficulty and I should like to support my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex. One of the difficulties is apparent when one considers the dates. If the auditor looks at the plans and publishes his response in June 2001, he will use as an assessment of those plans, the results for the years 1999 and 2000—so they will be at least 12 months out of date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have a reputation for being slow and incompetent, but in reality many of them are very quick to react. Many of them—I am sure that there will be a cry from Labour Members, but Wandsworth is an example—react very quickly. The chairmen and directors of the appropriate committees receive monthly reports on progress which are extrapolated to the year end so that they can react at an early stage. The local authority may well have reacted and corrected the difficulties that are shown up in the figures before the auditor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could the Under-Secretary possibly consider rethinking the dates or the order or putting in a requirement for the local authorities to move faster on their end of year figures so that they are relevant? There are three possible scenarios. First, the local authority may have already reacted in which case the criticism is unfair and unfounded. Secondly, in mediocre authorities where there has been no change, the council tax payers and recipients of services could see that their authorities continue to be mediocre and that there has been no progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third scenario involves actions that may be wilful, to use the Under-Secretary's words. I was intrigued by the Under-Secretary's remarks and thought of the match in Scotland. Could we accuse the Welsh and the All Blacks playing for the Welsh of wilfully losing to the Scots? But perhaps that is not quite relevant. The word "wilful" is as outrageous as that. The local authority could have failed in the year for which the figures are being assessed and in the following year could be even worse, but that would not be looked at by the auditor in his report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure it is not beyond the wit of the Department, assisted by the Under-Secretary to leave the date as it is now but perhaps to shift the requirement of the local authority to report on its annual figures earlier. Some local authorities are particularly incompetent—Lambeth springs to mind. Sometimes the figures were out of date year after
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
year and, eventually, nothing was relevant. However, for the majority of local authorities this would be much more appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Drawing on his experience, does my hon. Friend agree that monthly management information is obligatory? Monthly management information on departmental accounts, incomes and outflows should be produced on a regular basis. Does that apply in local authorities? Would not the amendment help to make it a requirement that local authorities produce timely management information for future business plans?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right; if such information is not a requirement, it should be. In the majority of local authorities such practices are up and running, as they are in many, if not most, business companies. A few are utterly incompetent; I will not name their complexion, but none is blue. The amendment would provide an opportunity for the Under-Secretary to put the squeeze on incompetent local authorities while allowing competent ones the opportunity to present their case under criticism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that the Bill gives enormous powers to the Welsh Assembly, although we have no idea about its efficiency and adherence to timetables. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley that we should insist that up-to-date information is used. From April, we are flying dark about the efficiency of the Welsh Assembly and the competence of its members. It should be incumbent upon them to take decisions on up-to-date information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Alan Meale)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 159 is designed to add to the list of items that an auditor must include in his report on a local performance plan. It would add a requirement for him to make recommendations about the inclusion of financial and other performance data relating to the financial year just concluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand Opposition Members' anxieties about this important issue, which we have already discussed at length. We share their concern that the local performance plan should reflect as fully as possible a picture of the authority's recent performance in order that ir should be meaningful and relevant to local people. However, the Bill as drafted achieves that satisfactorily. Clause 7(4)(c) contains a requirement for the auditor to make recommendations about how the plan could be amended so as to accord with clause 6, which sets out what authorities are required to do in producing the local performance plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can pause from his written word and note down a few dates. The audit is generally done by 30 June; there is a three-month delay. At that point, the auditor can only see whether the LPP is complete and whether it contains properly calculated indicators and measures. He will not be able to comment on the previous year's performance because those figures are generally not published until after the date mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0856">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>229</span>
The amendment may be incomplete and not phrased correctly, but in spite of the Minister being asked to read his brief, the reality is that the auditor will be looking at figures that are out of date and irrelevant, to the detriment of local people if the local authority is incompetent, or to the detriment of the local authority if it has reacted to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. I hope he will bear with me until I reach my next explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The auditors will assess, among other things, the extent to which the authority concerned has properly summarised its performance against indicators in the previous financial year and how that performance compares with what it has achieved in previous years. Those requirements are set up in clause 6(2)(f) and 6(2)(g); guidance issued by the Secretary of State could deal with how authorities might approach the practical issues involved in providing topical performance information. Such an auditor assessment will achieve precisely the effect that Opposition Members want. Amendment No. 159 would therefore be an unnecessary duplication and I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary's ministerial colleague talked about a wilful council. A wilful or incompetent council that is not up to date, does not have the current figures and perhaps only just managed to get the figures that applied 12 or 18 months previously will leave the auditor flying blind. That may be deliberate; an incompetent authority could stall in providing the figures, unless it was required to present them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex said that either there should be a delay in the date, or, preferably, that local authorities should be required to produce their figures earlier. No such requirement exists currently, and an incompetent or wilfully obstructive authority will provide the figures later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that it is possible to bring forward the date for the publication of the final accounts. We are in discussion with the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy to try to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that it is possible to get the information to the auditor through the auditing services for which—clause 6 provides. However, in the light of the arguments such as those that the hon. Member for Mole Valley presented, we are holding talks to ascertain whether we can bring dates forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will that be in the Bill? Yes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members are bobbing up and down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Under-Secretary has the Floor. Are you giving way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was giving way to the chap at the back, but Opposition Members are all on the hook, and I leave it to you, Mr. Gale, to decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>230</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forgive me, but it is not up to the Chair to decide to whom the Minister wishes to give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the chap at the back, I understood that there would be an amendment in the Bill to bring the dates forward. The Under-Secretary nodded assent and said yes. In that case, I am satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say yes. I said that talks were continuing and that we would report to the House in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Under-Secretary mentioned clause 6, I reread it carefully. Subsection (2)(g) requires comparison with the authority's performance in previous financial years. That does not necessarily mean the preceding financial year. Clause 6(2)(h) requires an authority.
	<br><q><p>"to summarise its assessment of its success in meeting any performance standard which applied at any time in the previous financial year".</p></q>
Therefore, nothing in the Bill suggests that the performance plan should be constructed in the light of the financial year in which the plan is drawn up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The auditor is likely to examine the plan after the beginning of the new financial year. We want him to be obliged to take the previous financial year—which was the current financial year when the plan was made—into consideration when he performs that task.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I believe that the words "previous financial year" in the clause cover those points, and that the information will be available to the auditor. We shall make every effort to ensure that the measure provides for that. We believe that the clause is a catch-all provision that can deliver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Essex referred to Clause 6(2)(g). We share the anxieties about ensuring that local authorities provide the right amount of information for the auditor. However, we do not want councils, through delay for one reason or another, to cause further delay in the publication of the local performance plan. As the hon. Gentleman knows, circumstances could arise that would cause an indefinite delay. We want to avoid that at all costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The auditor examines the performance plan. If he finds it deficient, does he report to the Audit Commission or the Secretary of State that the plan is deficient and that they need to take action, or does he say that the plan is deficient because of this or that, and recommend a course of action? That will have a crucial effect on the timetable. If he lobs it to the Secretary of State, saying that it is hopeless, the Secretary of State must then decide what is needed to remedy it, and the time scale will expand. Will the auditor have to identify the problem, or will his job, in practice, be to write a new improved report to recommend to the Commission or Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, the auditor's job will be to assess as fully as possible, from the information supplied to him, the complete audited details of the local performance plan.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0857">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>231</span>
We believe that sufficient information will be available for that. We are trying to ensure, through continuing discussions with CIPFA and others, that we create the circumstances for that. But, even without final agreement, expect this catch-all clause to be sufficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I am trying to get at is, if, in practice, the performance plan is inadequate, will it be the auditor's job to write a new plan, which he would then recommend to the Commission or, ultimately, the Secretary of State, to impose on the local authority, or does he merely identify the deficiency—the holes—in the plan and leave someone else to do the darning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, we differ over where ownership of the local performance is. It will lie with the local authority. The Audit Commission may provide an illustrated example of such a plan, but it would be in the form of guidance and would not have statutory force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By admitting that Government are in negotiations with CIPFA, surely the Minister has given the game way and shown that amendment No. 159 is needed to rectify a faulty Bill. Why is there no requirement for a new date in the Bill, and why are we not discussing that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having negotiations does not mean that there will be an agreement. We believe that we are in the right position now; it is up to CIPFA to convince us otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to be clear about what will happen. The auditor will, as a result of his investigations, give illustrative examples of where the plan has failed. What will be the process and the timetable after that? Who will take responsibility for dealing with mat, and how does it interface with, for example, existing legislative arrangements in authorities that already are obliged by law to produce plans, in the way that, for example, police authorities are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, ownership of the LPP lies with the local authority itself. He also knows mat clause 8 contains a wide diversity of types of plan, and obligations. If he will let me move to that, he may have the reply that he seeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, having told us that the Department is in discussions with CIPFA, has accepted that the crux of the amendments is the importance of shrinking the timing so that the data that the auditor examines is relevant. Is the Minister listening? The Committee needs to know whether he will bring forward an amendment, at least on Report, to clarify the issue and set the Bill right because, as now drafted, it is seriously flawed</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There can be no guarantee, prior to any talks between Ministers in Departments and outside organisations, that we will table an amendment. As I have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>232</span>
said, the Bill is a satisfactory catch-all measure. We are always looking at ways of improving it and of guaranteeing that the information provided to the auditor will give as full a picture as possible. If the opportunity to revise occurs in this place at some future time, we shall take it, but at the moment we have no agreement or thoughts otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I cannot accept that. The Minister has already accepted that discussions are taking place. He is talking to CIPFA, and he has admitted that the Government are considering legislating on this matter. It should be a key part of the Bill, which is flawed without it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot elaborate on what I have already said. At this stage, there are no guarantees. Talks are continuing on such matters and a range of other issues. In future, we may table an amendment, if we think that that is appropriate. Should the hon. Gentleman wish to pursue his objection to the Government's position, that is a matter for him and his colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 160 would require the best value auditor to consider whether the authority's local performance plan conforms with any relevant model produced by the Audit Commission. We do not support the amendment, but it raises some important matters, and I am grateful to Opposition Members for giving me an opportunity to address them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One such matter concerns rigidity and uniformity. Committee members do not need to be reminded that we are legislating for a rich variety of organisations. Because local and other authorities are so diverse in character, we have resisted the inclusion of restrictive rules in the Bill. However, local performance plans should be broadly consistent in terms of quality, accessibility and the comprehensiveness of what they cover. That is why clause 6 makes provision for the Secretary of State to have a guidance power on the form and content of plans. That will enable the Government to set out broad principles that authorities will be expected to follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within that broad framework, authorities must be free to develop their own approach. For that reason, I do not believe that we could develop a single-model approach covering all authorities of a single type, unless we introduced a level of central determination. However, we have consistently said that we do not want such determination, and I hope that Opposition Members will accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my memory is going and Alzheimer's disease is setting in. Will the Minister give me a little assistance on the guidance procedures? Will such procedures be discussed in a Committee of the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the guidance will be considered by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and we will make a judgment on it. If appropriate, an amendment would be tabled to make such guidance statutory, and it would then be subject to the usual formulas in this place.

I agree that the dissemination of best practice is important. That is why I welcomed the creation of the improvement and development agency, which will play a key role in involving local government in the development of the framework. We will thus foster a sense of ownership of best value, which will be crucial to its success. I remind the hon. Member for Mole Valley that lack of ownership fatally undermined compulsory competitive tendering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What will be the procedure on guidance in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Bill's provisions represent the most constructive way forward, and I therefore urge hon. Members to withdraw their amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point about Wales made by my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), will the Minister clarify whether the same rules will apply to police authorities? He generously mentioned that authorities can be very different. How will the changes interface with the existing status of police authorities in view of the legislative requirement to produce a plan, consult and have it audited? There is great concern about the uniformity—if that is not a pun—of provisions relating to police authorities. Can the Minister give an assurance that police authorities will be allowed to keep their distinctive local plans necessary for the particular requirements of policing in their areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not answering the query that the hon. Gentleman raised in our debate on a previous amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We considered the issues of uniformity, rigidity and the variety of available models and looked into what was already operational. As the hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out, under existing arrangements, Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary is required to publish its own reports but the responsibility rests with the police authorities and the Home Secretary. Alternatively, there are local authorities and Ofsted.

Is the Minister saying that existing statutory requirements on police authorities will effectively become the new requirements and that there will be no duplication in drawing up performance plans, organising consultation and auditing them?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the hon. Gentleman that policing plans will deal with efficiency and effectiveness.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am terribly sorry because the Minister is trying to respond reasonably, but I want to be clear. Are we talking about parallel processes in which overlapping matters will be considered or are we talking about existing process taking the place of the requirement placed on a local authority as a result of the Bill? If so, that should be stated clearly in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I just repeat that several bodies—the police, social services and the fire inspectorate, for example—will continue to produce plans as normal and that they will be complementary to the process? Some of the information will be incorporated into the local performance plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On these two relatively modest amendments, we have had more of a debate than we expected. Putting it charitably, the Under-Secretary has not got a grip on the issues. Whether the auditors of best value plans are obliged to have regard to the most recent financial information remains a real question. The danger is that local authorities might say that certain information is not ready and not relevant because the relevance of such information is not specified in the Bill. Clarity is essential over this potentially draconian process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the Under-Secretary's exchanges with my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley—I hope that the Under-Secretary is listening to me—and the requisite clarity did not emerge. I ask the Under-Secretary to take the provision away and have another look at it. If he is in negotiation with third parties about this part of the Bill, it is reasonable for the Committee to hear from him again about how the outstanding issues will be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 160, I ask the Under-Secretary to clarify one point. Is he giving an assurance that the Audit Commission will not produce a model for best value plans? He seemed to be saying that the amendment is not relevant and that a model will not be laid down, because that would be too prescriptive. He spoke eloquently about the rich variety of local councils, the inappropriateness of the approach, and the fact that guidance is already available. Will he clarify matters for us, because I think that the Audit Commission thinks it is to produce a model best value performance plan. He had better tell the Audit Commission if it is not to do so, because it may not know. If it is to produce one, that should be mentioned in the Bill, so that we know where we are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause raises issues about the sheer scale and volume of the work to be undertaken by the Audit Commission and the auditors working to its remit. The first amendment is merely a probing amendment. I would be grateful if the Minister could explain the relevance of subsections 4(3) to 4(6) of the Audit Commission Act 1998 and how the code of audit practice shall have effect in relation to the audit of best value plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 164 brings us back to an issue that we have discussed in earlier clauses. It seems peculiar that when the commission is consulting it should consult only people who appear to it to represent best value authorities rather than councillors, for example, who might represent best value authorities. I think it is for best value authorities to decide who best to represent them. The amendment therefore simply seeks to delete the phrase
	<br><q><p>"appearing to the Commission to represent"</p></q>
so that it should simply consult persons representing best value authorities. The same goes for subsection (7)(b) in relation to fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally there is the question of fee scales. Amendment No. 166 adds a new subsection suggesting that
	<br><q><p>"The maximum fee for the audit of a best value plan shall be a fixed percentage of the annual turnover of a plan according to a scale of percentages to be determined by the Audit Commission."</p></q>
Auditing a best value plan ought to be fairly straightforward. It ought to be possible to provide fixed fees. How much does the Minister think that a best value audit should cost? I believe that it is a regulatory burden mat falls upon the council tax payers of the authorities in question. They will have to pay it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A large authority with a great many functions might have many best value plans to audit. There might be best value plans for separate functions. I do not know whether that is the way the Minister envisages the process working. Must there be a single best value plan for all an authority's functions, in which case it will be rather like a budget, or will it be split up by function so that different functions are audited in different ways? If it is to be a fairly standard audit, it should be a fairly standard fee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder why we have not gone in the opposite direction and suggested that local authorities should go out to tender for the auditing. After all, Ofsted inspection teams bid to come into the schools and the school board of management hires a particular auditing team. Would it not be a good idea if, to keep the costs
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0860">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>237</span>
down, local authorities were able to bid for auditors on the non-list of approved auditors that will be drawn up by the Audit Commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's enthusiasm for some kind of bidding process, but unfortunately because of what we have already decided in clause 7, the auditor is predetermined; it will be the authority's auditor. There can be no bidding process because in the interests of efficiency the Government clearly believe that the best value performance plan client, which is the authority, should stick to the monopoly supplier which is the authority's auditor. I have great sympathy for the idea of competitive tendering for the audit of plans. That is what the private sector does but that is not the way the Government have chosen to proceed. Perhaps the Minister can give us some thoughts on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am seeking to establish how much the process will cost. There are hundreds of local authorities so there will possibly be thousands of best value performance plans. The Audit Commission will obviously have to expand its empire quite considerably. How much does a best value audit cost? Should there be a mechanism by which to stipulate a maximum to protect council tax payers? When there is great demand for an inadequate supply the price goes up. With thousands of best value plans being audited every year there may not be enough people available to do the work. Local authorities should not be forced to pay over the odds for an audit of best value plans. I should be grateful for the Minister's comments on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may remember that I raised this issue on Second Reading. I suggested that she and the other Ministers in her Department took a deep breath and talked to Westminster council, which is probably an authority on fees for district auditors doing investigations. New clause 5 proposes a scale of fees.
	<br><q><p>"in respect of inspections carried out under section 10",</p></q>
and recognises that there will be variations from that scale of fees, which could be substantially more or less. It is the crux of our argument that fees could be "substantially more" will worry council tax payers. We ask the Government to consider placing a ceiling on fees, perhaps paying fees in excess of a certain amount or including some form of safeguard so that the costs do not run out of hand to such an extent that they devalue any gain from the inspection itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us how she envisages the structure of the Audit Commission developing in the next few years? The Audit Commission, which plays a key role in the Bill, is a quango. It is an admirable organisation and we do not want to attack its functions, but, as it admits, it will need more staff. The Audit Commission's functions have been established, but I want to know how it fared in the fundamental expenditure review. What is its budget? What is its staffing? What does the Minister anticipate that they will be in the next few years? What has been built into the plans to enable it to operate? How much of its budget will be recoverable from the fees that it levies and how much will come from the Government? It would be helpful if the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>238</span>
would say how the Audit Commission will respond to the challenges placed upon it. Perhaps she will write to the Committee on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon. There will be a supply and demand effect, nowhere more so than in Wales where, as the Minister will remember, an Auditor General will be appointed for the Welsh Assembly. There will also be an auditor to audit the Auditor General's accounts. There will be pressure on the auditing profession. Has the Minister done any research into the number of available businesses prepared to take on the work? If not enough are available, there will be pressure to put up prices. Has the Minister considered making extra funds available? Has she looked into the future of the issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister probably does not have pinpoint accurate figures, but I am sure that notwithstanding what I said earlier, she will have notional figures on the costs involved, nationally and broken down by area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am appreciative of hon. Members who are raising important issues about the cost of audit and inspection, which is an important part of the Bill. I should like to deal with general matters first and then move on to individual amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect best value to lead to efficiency savings of 2 per cent, per year in each authority, which more than outweighs any additional costs arising from audit inspection arrangements. Audit inspection will be a vital element underpinning best value both to ensure a robust approach by local authorities and accountability to the public. Additional funding to meet the cost of inspections will come from the revenue support grant or from a direct grant to the commission, and we intend to table a Government amendment to make provision for it. That will enable the Welsh Assembly to give grants to the commission as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Officials are in discussion with the commission of the likely cost of audit and inspection, which has yet to be finalised. As the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon acknowledged, we have appointed a new chair who is cognisant of the Audit Commission's new undertakings. The Audit Commission itself, as well as carrying out the fundamental management and performance review, has undertaken a review of its own internal structure more effectively to face the challenges of the Bill.

Hon. Members will know that an annual fee increase for 1998–99 of 3.9 per cent, was announced in December with an additional 1 per cent, to shore up reserves depleted by the reorganisation costs of district audit and the legal costs of the Westminster case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 163 would remove the requirement that auditors should have regard to the code of practice laid down by the Audit Commission Act 1998. I acknowledge that the hon. Member for North Essex moved it as a probing amendment, but it would prevent auditors from having to follow the best professional practice on standards, procedures and techniques. It would also remove the requirement that a code should not come into force until approved by each House of Parliament. It would prevent Parliament from subjecting the code to regular review and remove the commission's flexibility to amend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Removing subsection (8)(3) would make the Bill's provision different from that in the Audit Commission Act 1998 and would also remove the safeguards afforded by subjecting the code to rigorous parliamentary scrutiny. Opposition Members have argued for more safeguards and we certainly need them in that respect. In the light of my explanation, I hope that the hon. Member for North Essex will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister anticipated annual efficiency gains in local government of 2 per cent. Can I ask her to explain where that figure comes from, given the enormous range of authorities? For example, there is Manchester council—led for many years by the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Stringer)—with a large budget; and in my constituency there is Craven district council, which is minuscule. Is it 2 per cent, on average, or across the board? What sort of target does the Minister expect from the better authorities and what from the laggards, which we agree are the authorities at which attention most needs to be directed? The 2 per cent, is frightfully convenient, a bit like the anticipated annual increase in agriculture yield which we build in for Agenda 2000. It is just too convenient to ring true. Where does it come from? On what basis does the Minister expect a 2 per cent, efficiency gain, and will it eventually be reflected in the SSA formula?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We negotiated this through the comprehensive spending review. It is not to be taken out of revenue support grant. It will ensure that money is available for innovation and the development of good practice by local authorities. We expect the 2 per cent, efficiency gains to be across the board. It comes from experience of what is possible in the service sector, in both public services and in some services that are largely the private sector's responsibility. We think that it is an achievable target that goes alongside the sort of continuous improvement that we have in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that so many interventions are tiresome, but this is part of the process. Will it be required of each authority, or will it be across the board. We have talked about high quality authorities.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>240</span>
The teasing out of incremental additional amounts will be difficult. Equally, 2 per cent, as a target for the most ghastly local authorities is not at all ambitious; it is a funking of the process. We are talking about a target. I assume that they have built the target into their spending processes. What happens if they do not hit it? Will they be audited to get the 2 per cent? The Minister cannot suddenly introduce this 2 per cent, into the conversation without our having an interest in how it works in practice. The fact that the fundamental expenditure review retained it as some kind of criterion does not indicate that anyone has negotiated it, except perhaps with the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is trying to pretend that I said much more than I did. I said that we think that best value can reasonably expect authorities to make across-the-board efficiency savings of 2 per cent. That is not a negotiated figure; it is not reflected in reductions in RSG or anything else. It is simply what we think good efficient services can deliver year on year. It is the sort of target which, as I have said, is prevalent throughout the service industry, especially in the private sector. With best value, we hope to achieve the very best outcomes—paraded before us by the hon. Member for North Essex—that the private sector expects to achieve. There is a difference between public sector and private sector services, but this sort of expectation is clearly taken as normal in other circumstances, and we shall take it as normal in the delivery of public services. The public have a right to expect that standard of efficiency and performance from both large and small authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave examples when justifying the 2 per cent, across-the-board saving. She talked about public and private sector organisations. Could she give us a feel for a public or private sector organisation of a similar type to the broad range of authorities? It is hard to imagine a private sector organisation with a range as broad as that covered by tiny councils in distant rural areas and large metropolitan authorities. From where does she draw her figure of 2 per cent? She has given us some examples but we should like them to be a little more tangible. We are concerned about this for the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great difficulty in taking the hon. Gentleman seriously. This is about year-on-year improvements and any organisation involved in service delivery must have that ambition at the heart of what it is doing. If the hon. Member was responsible for looking at the quality of service at his local supermarket, he could expect that supermarket to be conscious of the range of things that people were looking for, to make sure that it was up to date, to introduce new products without adding to costs and to do all efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will doubtless remember that his Government had a 3 per cent, annual efficiency target for the national health service which was reflected in NHS budget. I have made it clear that this is not to be reflected in the budget in terms of the revenue support grant, but it is there to challenge and let every authority know that this applies to them. It cannot get out of it by saying that it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0862">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>241</span>
is a small authority or a big authority with a complex organisation. It is right and appropriate that every organisation related to local government should be expecting year-on-year approval. Opposition Members are trying to take us down an interesting road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 164 seeks to remove from subsection 8(6) the Audit Commission's legitimate discretionary powers about whom to consult before preparing or altering the code of practice or when prescribing the scale of fees for best value audits. The amendment would restrict the commission's freedom to take views and force it to consult only with those directly or explicitly representing best value authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not to say that the Audit Commission will not consult those representing best value authorities, but there may be other organisations or groups that have an impact that it would be appropriate for it to consult even if they are not the direct representatives of local government. For example, it may be appropriate for it to consult one of the companies that was involved in the delivery of public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of the clause enables the Audit Commission to work out who has an appropriate interest and who should be consulted. I cannot imagine a proposal in which the local authorities would not be part of the consultation. When I read the amendment I thought that the hon. Member for North Essex was trying to restrict it to the Local Government Association again—we had similar amendments to an earlier clause. I wondered whether that was what the amendment related to. As I have given him that explanation, I hope that he will now understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case—it is a good case—why does the Bill use the word "represent". The Minister has described consultation not with people who represent best value authorities but with those who have an interest in best value. Therefore, the words in the Bill do not cover the circumstances that we are considering. The word "represent" has a clear meaning in English. Will the Minister undertake to amend the Bill later to make it clear that those who have an interest in best value can be consulted? Otherwise, the Bill does not convey the power that the Minister described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all subject to parliamentary counsel. The wording of the clause gives the Audit Commission the flexibility to decide whom to consult. I, too, am sometimes confused by the actual words that appear in the Bill. However, I am sure that the current wording covers the points that we have been discussing. Hon. Members would not want to remove the flexibility or discretion that allows the Audit Commission to take account of a proper range of views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely confused. I acknowledge that the Minister has to fall back on briefing for technical matters. However, how can a company that performs a function or service for a local authority "represent" a best value authority? Again, I am worried that we are giving the Secretary of State or the Audit Commission discretion to consult whoever the Secretary of State believes to be representative of best value authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>242</span>
I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon that the Secretary of State should have the freedom to consult anyone he wishes, but the clause does not convey that. The Minister's comments have confused matters further. I understand that the Secretary of State might not want to be restricted to consultation with formal representatives of a local authority, such as a chief officer a finance officer, or a group of councillors rather than all the councillors. I thought that the Minister was about to say that, but she did not. She has further confused matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has totally confused me. The amendment that we are considering does not relate to the Secretary of State. The hon. Gentleman is talking about the wrong amendment. He has not allowed me to get to the amendment that deals with the Secretary of State. I was talking about the amendment on the Audit Commission.

Gentleman would prefer me not to get wound up, as he might find himself the target of the winding up, and that would not be pleasant. I do not want to do that; I am keen for us to discuss matters in the best order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 165 purports to remove from subsection 8(7) discretionary powers for the Audit Commission over consultation in prescribing the scale of fees for best value audits. However, the subsection refers to an obligation on the Secretary of State to consult the commission and those who appear to the Secretary of State to represent best value authorities. I expect that that is what Opposition Members tried to achieve when they tabled the amendment. The amendment is flawed, though I never worry about that. I shall try to help the hon. Member for North Essex by clarifying matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would restrict the Secretary of State's freedom to take views, and force him to consult only those who directly and explicitly represented best value authorities. The clauses would allow the Secretary of State the flexibility to decide whom to consult. Removing that flexibility and discretion would inhibit his ability to do what was required, and to take account of a proper range of views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 166 would set limits on the level of fees for best value audits, by attempting to create a link between the fee and the turnover of the authority. I understand the concerns that underlie the amendment, but they are misplaced. We understand the need for some parameters on the amount that authorities pay for best value audits. That is why we have placed the Audit Commission under an obligation, in clause 8, to prescribe an appropriate scale. It is not appropriate to qualify that scale according to the size of the authority as reflected in plan turnover.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be saying that a plan will apply to a whole authority. Is that correct, or will there be separate plans for different functions within an authority, which would seem a sensible approach? Some local authorities are very big businesses, covering a wide range of activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We covered this issue earlier in Committee, when we discussed the possibility that authorities might want a review to operate across functions, and, for example, cover all the services for children or for the elderly. We have said that there should be a five-year rolling programme for reviews and that the performance plan should follow that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each year just one local performance plan would be expected. We should not want authorities to produce so many as to give rise to the problem suggested by the hon. Member for Mole Valley, which is that the number of plans in the public domain would leave the public fed up with them, or confused. If we allowed or encouraged that approach, it would make things easier for authorities that wanted to escape the rigour of best value. I do not believe that most local authorities want to do that. I am heartened by the enthusiasm with which they have already embraced the concept, even before the Bill is passed. On the other hand, a degree of rigour is needed. That will mean that authorities study best value and reflect it in the performance plan so that local people have good, easy access to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The approach set out in amendment No. 166 is crude in the extreme and would place an unnecessary restriction on the Audit Commission's professional judgments about what was appropriate. I remind hon. Members that the Audit Commission is well accustomed to such tasks, as it already performs a similar function in relation to fees for audit of accounts under the Audit Commission Act 1998.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much extra manpower will the Audit Commission require to manage best value? Perhaps more crucially, from the authorities' point of view, what is the cost of compliance? What additional cost, in aggregate, will implementing the legislation place on local government? Obviously, the measure will pay for itself if it secures the efficiencies that we hope for, but what will be paid in fees for audit of best value plans?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We anticipate that the annual costs of a strengthened audit and inspection framework will be in the order of an additional £50 million a year, once the best value framework is fully operational. That is a modest increase and if, for that level of cost, we can achieve what we envisage, it will be exceptionally good value for the council tax payer. It will mean significant improvement for a modest increase in costs across local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister repeat what the £50 million refers to?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It refers to the strengthened audit and inspection framework. It therefore includes additional work don by the Audit Commission. We took account of that in the comprehensive spending review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Sally Keeble	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Northampton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful to establish the context of the extra spending by comparing it with the extra spending on the poll tax, which cost every local authority £9 million to £10 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. The previous Administration also incurred additional costs when they introduced the Office for Standards in Education, but I shall not say anything further about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said enough to persuade the hon. Member for North Essex to withdraw his amendment. Government amendments in this group are minor, technical amendments which correct typographical errors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The evaluation of an additional £50 million is dramatic. What percentage increase does that represent on the current regime and who will pay it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not been listening. I have already explained how the increase will be accounted for and how it will be paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give a percentage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I do not have a percentage: that is not our approach. We have been far from profligate: we examined needs and pared them down to ensure that a proper framework is created. Compared with the additional costs that the previous Administration placed on local government, the settlement is very reasonable. I repeat that any additional funding necessary to meet the costs of inspection will be met through the revenue support grant or made by direct grant to the commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's response. The Treasury will provide extra money, but the additional cost of expensive audits will fall on local authorities. Nominally, such costs will be included in the revenue support grant settlement, but bills will be sent to local authorities themselves. Grant is given directly to the Audit Commission, but the Minister did not say that it would receive an extra £50 million to cover additional costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for clarification on the fee arrangements. We will wish to consider the question of fees for local authorities in future, but I now beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
