</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We look forward, Mr. Hood, to working under your chairmanship today. A very hot day has been forecast, and we shall be feeling it by the end of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) sends his apologies. He is present at the graduation of his son in Newcastle. We have already discovered that the composition of the Committee allows what has been called a shift system to operate. It is definitely my turn today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already commenced a detailed discussion of the practical aspects of the power of entry conferred on the agency by clause 11. Our amendments are all practical. It is only reasonable that agency officials should have the courtesy to give prior notice to the owners of the premises that they wish to enter, and that they should do so at a reasonable hour. Relatively recent examples have been given of inspectors arriving unannounced, particularly at farm premises, to make random spot checks to ensure that nothing untoward is going on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin Barron 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rother Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is rather early in the debate, but I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that entry is likely to be required to ensure that nothing untoward is happening inside the establishment, it will be a form of enforcement. Would it not give notice to people who were knowingly breaking the law for the agency to have to give prior notice of entry? That would ensure that no one was caught.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need to distinguish between a visit made simply to observe and a visit made to ascertain whether something serious was going on. However, a farmer in receipt of a letter from the Ministry pointing out the need for a random check on his premises would also be required to make his staff available. We all know that farmers are not over-endowed with staff; many have only one farmhand. The lack of a prior appointment could make it difficult for the owners of some premises, particularly small business premises, to comply readily and agreeably with a visit. As one farmer pointed out to me recently, the last thing that any farmer wants to do when making silage is to have to down tools in the middle of that process to assist with the inspection of another part of the farm. That is a practical example of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other inspection agencies, including Customs and Excise, have been cited as parallel examples of the agency's power of entry, and they are certainly expected to make an appointment to carry out an observation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ian Gibson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady distinguish between environmental health officers not giving prior notice to someone making jam tarts, who may be just as busy as someone making silage, and the other examples that she gives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall come to the clear distinction between the role of the agency in carrying out observations and the role and responsibility of local authorities, which are charged with the first-line responsibility for carrying out the proper examination of premises. As we shall discuss later, only when the agency has an overseeing role for that proper enforcement authority would it take over that function. There is a distinction between observations and visits paid by the environmental health officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 29 sets down the need to give a receipt for samples taken. That provision would tighten the Bill. Food products taken as samples may be of considerable value to those premises and it would be good practice for the visiting officer of the agency to give a receipt for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the event of a need to enter premises, we would ask the Minister to consider the practice of Customs and Excise officers, who would normally be accompanied by the police when undertaking visits. It is important that the nature of the visit should be proportionate to the task in hand because the way in which officials conduct random visits to premises will dictate the response that they receive. We welcome the Minister's comments on the parallels between the way in which Customs and Excise officials might carry out their visits and those carried out by the staff of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important that agency staff should not be given carte blanche to enter premises and remove what they want without any justification or explanation. Customs and Excise officers have to give receipts for anything and everything that they take; surely it is right to expect Food Standards Agency officials to do the same. It is reasonable to expect officials to provide a receipt for goods that they remove, if only to make
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0549">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
them more careful about what they take. They may take items other than food that are worth a considerable amount, and that could result in the owner of the premises losing thousands of pounds worth of stock—only to find that, with no receipt for those items, any entitlement to compensation would be weakened because there was no evidence of the items having been removed in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 33 is designed to deal with the fact that the manner in which an observation is carried out and in which the agency officers conduct themselves may give rise to irritation on the part of the owner of the premises. If a visit is made without prior appointment and items are taken without explanation or receipt, it is not unreasonable to expect that the owner of the premises may be less than entirely happy. Adding the words "without reasonable excuse" strikes a better balance and only mirrors the provision in paragraph (b). It is reasonable to balance the clause in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 30 concerns records. Agency officers will have the power to
	<br><q><p>"inspect and copy any records found on any premises".</p></q>
The records are not precisely defined. They could pertain to the financial health of a company. Outsiders cannot usually inspect and copy such records. Businesses are concerned about protecting commercial confidentiality. In the first group of amendments to the clause, we debated the qualifications that officers of the agency should have to define more closely who will be appropriate to enter premises and carry out such observations. We are interested in the level of those qualifications in relation to what will be found and understood from the records, and what follows from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 73 reasonably suggests that a receipt should be issued if copies are taken of records found on the premises. If any commercially sensitive information is subsequently misused—a subject that will be debated under a later clause—inquiries will consider it important to have evidence of when that information was first acquired and when it reappeared elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are designed to tighten the powers of entry that officers will be granted under the clause. They are all well within the parallel of the guidelines that cover Customs and Excise. We hope that the Government will be amenable to amending the clause in a way that will provide safeguards for the owners of observed premises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Maclean 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Penrith and The Border)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us be absolutely clear what clause 11 is about, because some Labour Members have misunderstood it. Its purpose is not to allow officers to enter premises to enforce the law against people who have committed offences. It is not a power of enforcement, but a draconian power of entry to observe and to take some of the 187,000 samples that until now have been taken voluntarily, by agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As clause 11 gives officers of the state and others whom the agency may appoint the power to take food
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
samples, it is extraordinary that in most circumstances appointments will not have to have been made with the businesses from which samples will be taken. The Minister often points out that parliamentary draftsmen are responsible for the wording of the Bill, and I take the same view. They obviously have no concept of how businesses work, especially small businesses. The people hired to do the job will be individuals such as the wallah from Essex university, and even new postgraduates from Newcastle, irrespective of the merits of their daddies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the graduates whom the agency empowers to undertake such work walk into a big branch of Marks and Spencer or a big production line of Northern Foods, say that they have come to observe, show their warrant cards, demand assistance and want to take over the office and inspect the records, they will be met by senior or floor manager, then handed over to the assistant manager. The undermanagers will keep the production line going and, in big supermarkets, business will continue unhindered. However, although big food production and processing plants and big supermarkets account for a large part of the food industry's turnover, the vast majority of businesses in the industry are infinitely smaller.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only the farms that my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) mentioned will be affected—most of which are one-man or one-man-and-woman businesses, going flat out to keep the business going. In most cases, Customs and Excise officials and others who inspect farmers' books make appointments to ensure that the farmers are available—the same is true for other food businesses—reserving the power to enforce the law when they are there and to have a right of entry at any time if they suspect that an offence has been committed. In enforcement circumstances, I am happy, if the law has been broken or if there is a threat that it may be broken, for officers to have a right of entry without prior appointment, because the law must be enforced. However, when officials are not required to enforce the law, it is extraordinary to give them powers of entry without their having to make prior appointment. Thousands of small businesses cannot afford to take time off in the middle of an operation, whether it be making jam tarts, silaging or serving customers in the little village shop, to interrupt what they are doing in order to render all assistance to people coming unannounced to observe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not know how long such operations may take. Time constraints will be placed on officers, because the agency will no doubt give them a quota. If 200 officers or contracted-out employees must collect 187,000 samples, they will have to collect a few hundred samples a day, and will, therefore, have to perform under time and efficiency constraints. Nevertheless, we have no idea how long a business might be interrupted if such people arrive unannounced at any reasonable hour, demand that everything be laid at their disposal to take samples, inspect and copy records, and require someone to render assistance to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0550">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>185</span>
In most small businesses, during working hours, which may be from 7 am to 7 pm, people work flat out, whether making jam tarts, silaging, mucking out the byre or processing food. In the evening, they work on the computer records. Most small businesses, along with larger businesses, complain that the Government have made them the tax collector. They must complete computer and value-added-tax records in the evening to ensure that they are not prosecuted. If, in the middle of the day, during the physical production work—food processing, preparation or transportation—such businesses must break off to dig out computer records and help people who have not made an appointment for a more convenient time, that will seriously disrupt the business, all because people want to observe at their own convenience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of small businesses in particular, the person coming to observe should do so by prior appointment at a time convenient to the business, and often that will mean in the evening. It is not a nine-to-five operation; I do not see why such people should work from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock at their convenience, when the bosses—not the employees—of small businesses such as bakeries in my constituency work from 6 am to 7 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Desmond Turner 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brighton, Kemptown)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the right hon. Gentleman missed the point about sampling and the operation of the agency? It is vital that any samples taken by the agency are representative. A representative picture of a process cannot be obtained by appointment. By definition, samples must be taken at any time when a process is in operation. If we were to accept the amendment, we would render the agency less efficient and less effective than it should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that at all; it is absolute nonsense. If the hon. Gentleman were right, the 187,000 samples that the Minister and MAFF have managed to take would be absolutely useless. I have seen such samples in the past, and I know their validity. If every company were to close its production line, scrub it spotlessly clean and stop its business just because a Government inspector was coming to take samples by appointment, representative samples could not be obtained. However, that is not how the system works in reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking about people making appointments to enforce the law when businesses are worried that they are breaking the rules or that their systems are imperfect, so they clean everything up. We know that that can happen in some parts of the food industry when people know that an environmental health officer is coming the next day. Some businesses, especially those at the smaller end of the catering industry in certain cities, certainly clean up their act when an EHO is coming the next day; they do scrub out the little cafe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then they go on in the same way the next day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those who have theoretical medical knowledge, but no business experience, should wait for the relevant clauses before having their say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
I support the amendments because they are essential if business is to co-operate sensibly with the agency. There is no question of diluting the agency's powers. We are lead to believe that enforcement powers will continue to rest with local authority EHOs and trading standards officers who deal with labelling, and so on. We are dealing with the power to observe, take food samples and improve knowledge and research. The current system works well—the Government obtain 187,000 samples voluntarily, with the industry's full co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will give inspectors a right of entry without prior appointment; they will be able to do what they like and gain access "at any reasonable hour" to take samples. That is a seismic shift—a term that the Prime Minister uses occasionally—in relations with the vast majority of businesses in the food industry that co-operate sensibly with the Government. The attitude of business will be changed unnecessarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Meriden has made all the points excellently. However, I want to mention receipts, which will be essential, especially for company records. We have discovered that civil servants will no longer be the only people to make such observations. They may not be civil servants at all if the work is contracted out to other organisations. In those circumstances, receipts for the records or the copies of records taken are essential. I am certain that, if civil servants and officers of the state are not the ones taking the copies, sooner or later some of the records will be abused and used improperly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those without the civil service ethos who have not been imbued with its integrity will use those records for their own advantage. For example, it will be tremendously tempting to store information on an incredible, new bread-making process that a company has developed. Although companies may be bound by a confidentiality clause, I am dashed certain that some of them will keep such information to themselves and seek to use it if they lose the FSA contract. That is the nature of human beings. The British civil service cannot use the information in that way. If the powers are to be vested in other individuals, which could mean anyone—whether a member of staff or not—we must have more checks and controls on them than the Government wish to give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Peter Brand 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Isle of Wight)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting collection of amendments, some of which are laudable and some of which are, frankly, not very intelligent. The objective of taking samples is to do research. It is a well-known phenomenon in research that as soon as one starts observing something, it alters; giving notice of the fact that one is going to be observing will indeed alter—not necessarily for good or bad—what is being observed. It is therefore essential that the agency can take spot, rather than planned, samples. Always having to give a prior appointment would clearly run against the objective that the agency is trying to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, amendment No. 30 asks that only material relevant to any on-going investigation be taken, as a prior explanation for taking samples. Again, when one is sampling a process, one does not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0551">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>187</span>
always know what one is looking for; it is therefore important that the agency is not restricted in that way. For those reasons we oppose the amendments, provided that the Minister gives an assurance that the spirit of amendments No. 29 and 73, which constitute good manners, will be honoured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In what way does amendment No. 29 preclude any sample being taken? All it asks for is the sensible measure of giving a receipt, at the same time as the sample is taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just about to come to that. I was going to ask the Minister for an assurance that when samples are taken, a receipt will be given. That is only good manners and good practice. Unless one records what one has done and shares that record with the person who is affected by it, no one will believe that the sampling has been of worth. We support amendments No. 29 and 73, but it is probably unnecessary to include them in the Bill because any agency worth its salt would already carry out such practices. I hope that we will not divide on the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a little naive in trusting the broad band of people allowed in on the provisions in subsection (1). The clause authorises any individual to exercise the powers. The hon.

We should not let the clause go past without further comment. It gives powers, unprecedented in any legislation, to enable people who are merely making observations to have all the powers of entry. It does not deal with enforcement. That is dealt with in clause 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill goes a lot further than sections 32 and 33 of the Food Safety Act 1990, which is the major Act to which the Bill refers. For example, the Act contains a safeguard for private dwelling houses in clause 32(1) which states:
	<br><q><p>"but admission to any premises used only as a private dwelling house shall not be demanded as of right unless 24 hours' notice of the intended entry has been given to the occupier."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
The power to carry out observations and to enter someone's private dwelling house is considerable. Clause 11(3)(a) of the Bill provides that entry may be "at any reasonable hour", but if entry to someone's private dwelling-house is required merely to carry out observations, a little more notice should be given. As a general rule and as a matter of courtesy, there is nothing wrong—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, the Bill states that premises do not include private dwelling-houses, but we require some assurances. I intended to raise the matter of cafes and bed and breakfast establishments on clause stand part. When a back room is a sitting room and a front room is a cafe, and in the case of bed and breakfast establishments, rating valuation officers draw a distinction for rating purposes between the room that is public and the room that is private. I have no doubt that environmental health officers make the same distinction, but we need assurances on the position of buildings in which a commercial business is run in an annexe to the house or there is a cafe in one room of a house while the remainder is a private business, such as bed and breakfast establishments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon.

The thrust of my comments is that it is only reasonable courtesy that, for the purpose of making observations, any official authorised by the Food Standards Agency should make a prior appointment. If the Minister for Public Health cannot accept our amendment, I hope that she will make it clear that, under normal circumstances, an official should be required to make a prior appointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember having the same discussion with my local planning officer because local planning legislation provides for immediate entry if necessary. Of course there will be circumstances, when an offence is suspected but there is no evidence, in which people may require entry to premises fairly quickly to make observations. However, in general, people in this country are innocent until proved guilty. Therefore, the presumption should always be that it is not necessary to enter premises without an appointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 73 requires a receipt to be provided. Here again, the Bill moves into the territory of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. What is reasonable in taking away evidence and samples? If samples and evidence are to be taken away, it is essential—especially for future proceedings—that a proper listed receipt should be given. Otherwise, there could be a huge argument about which filing cabinet or file a certain document was removed from, what samples were removed, and which test tubes they came from. It is only reasonable that a full written receipt should be provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely there is a greater problem. Much of the sampling will be carried out on a targeted basis because the agency's staff will have a list of what they are looking for. For example, if the agency is running a check on tartrazine in fruit juice and takes 20 samples from different brands from different shops, surely it is vital that an accurate list and a receipt should be provided. Otherwise, when the Minister or the agency names and shames the brands of orange juice that contain too much tartrazine, there will be a strong possibility of legal action if they get it wrong. In those circumstances, there needs to be an accurate receipt and an accurate description of the sample, so that there can be no quibble about whose orange juice contains too much tartrazine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend makes a valid point. That is not only in the interests of the person from whom samples are taken, it is in the interests of the agency, because unless the agency can prove conclusively in court from which test tube or jar it took the samples, the person might be acquitted. I hope that the Minister will respond to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on to consider the question of which premises are involved. We must carefully consider this issue because one can imagine hoards of food police descending on a great many premises and infiltrating every one of them, without thinking carefully about from where they wish to take samples. Therefore, it is wholly reasonable that we should know from which premises the agency wishes to take samples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I turn to the question of whether those who take samples can be obstructed without reasonable
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
excuse. I refer the Minister to clause 33(1)(b) of the Food Safety Act 1990, from which we have taken the wording for amendment No. 33. If a person can provide a reasonable excuse for obstructing an official who wishes to enter premises to take samples, that excuse could be used in mitigation when the case comes to court. Therefore, I ask the Minister carefully to consider whether she can accept our amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause enters unknown territory in that it gives officials unprecedented powers of entry. The Minister of State is on record as saying that the agency will be the most powerful quango in the country. He got it wrong. The agency will not be a quango; it will be a non-ministerial body, and there is a distinction. A quango does not employ civil servants, whereas a non-ministerial body does. Will bona fide civil servants exercise the powers in clause 11, or will those wide powers be delegated to, and exercised by, some undergraduate? [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Labour Members may well laugh, but the Bill confers unprecedented powers. If we want to progress towards a totalitarian state, and allow agency staff to enter peoples' private premises at any time on the whim of some official in an office, the Bill will take us in that direction. Parliament exists to guard jealously individuals' rights. If Labour Members do not share that view, they should explain why to their constituents. If we suspect that they want to grant such unprecedented powers without the appropriate safeguards—Parliament should legitimately insert such powers into legislation—we shall publicise that fact in press releases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister for Public Health has pressing questions to answer about the clause, which involves officials' powers to enter premises to take samples and to make observations. Clause 14 is different in this context because it involves enforcement powers. Clause 11 is a worrying clause, and Parliament may rue the day that it was agreed to. The Minister should give a considered reply. We shall examine her speech carefully to see how we can circumscribe the clause and ensure that Parliament's intentions in this context are clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown). It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood. I hope that I will obey all the relevant rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not discuss the clause for long because we have already covered most of the points that I want to make. It breaks away from the image of the FSA that I support. As I said on Second Reading and in earlier speeches in Committee, I support the concept of a benign agency that works with the industry and is seen to be the industry's friend. It should treat the industry as its main customer, disseminate useful information, conduct useful research and act with the industry to benefit the end consumer. The clause is extremely antagonistic. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Labour Members may laugh, but the FSA simply will not work if it does not have the confidence of those who work in the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that I have some sympathy with his views, but does he accept that the FSA would not be the industry's friend if it

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>191</span>
condoned bad practice and was soft on people who lower our food industry's generally high standards? That is exactly why the clause's powers are needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the hon. Lady and I will have to split on this matter, as we have done previously. She has great faith in officials' ability to improve practices in food businesses. Apparently, she believes that any individual who is called in by the FSA will improve practices in food businesses. I do not have such faith, and that is where we will have to split. I do not believe that allowing the FSA to call in any individual will improve matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We pointed out earlier that the explanatory notes suggest that contractors such as university research teams may be involved, although there is no evidence to suggest that they will be qualified to help. An abattoir in east Wales, which is not far from where I live, was audited recently by one of the supermarkets, and it was established that those who work in the Meat Hygiene Service were the main cause of the breach of the protocols. They did not respect the protocols—they did not leave dirty overalls or dirty tools in one part of the factory—although they are highly paid, qualified members of the biggest food quango in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause's powers of entry will allow people to observe and to collect information, but the Government appear to want to let anyone into an abattoir, although he or she may not have a clue about the relevant protocols. A university team may include a dozen people and an abattoir may employ fewer people. How on earth can one monitor where members of the team go or check that they have not breached one of the protocols? I fundamentally disagree with the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Todd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Derbyshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer Opposition Members once again to clause 23(2). Clause 23 is the overarching clause in this context, and it involves proportionality. It clearly states that, when the agency exercises any power, including that which we are debating, it has to take into account the costs and benefits of the action and the likely risks that are involved. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health should explain how the power will be exercised, but I honestly believe that that overarching power is the foundation of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not test your patience, Mr. Hood, by discussing clause 23 prematurely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Line 1 of clause 11 clearly states:
	<br><q><p>"The Agency may authorise any individual".</p></q>
That gives blanket coverage. There is no qualification on who those individuals are to be or whether they will understand the processes of the business that they are visiting. There is every risk that that will be damaging, because it will set the agency against the food industry, and we want them to work closely together. We do not want a business to hear the man on its gate calling, "The Food Standards Agency has arrived", and the reaction to be, "Oh God, they're after us."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>192</span>
We want businesses to welcome a visit. We want the people involved to hear all the facts and figures. They should be able to visit any part of the factory and to be told, "Wear this overall. Clean your feet before you do that." The agency's functions should be performed in a controlled way with the maximum co-operation from those who run the businesses. The Government's broad-brush approach is risky and will not get the co-operation of people who run the businesses. I repeat: this measure will not work unless the food industry has faith in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will not work if the hon. Gentleman's deliberate misrepresentation of the project continues. He has a systematic and abiding hatred of the Meat Hygiene Service. We understand his reasons for that, but to ignore what we have said about guiding principles and the constraints that will be placed on the agency's work does a disservice to our scrutiny of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that response, although I shall not be tempted to discuss the Meat Hygiene Service now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has missed the point if he thinks that he can establish an agency which will not have the cooperation of the industry. If he lets people without qualifications turn up at their convenience at any business at any time, he will not gain the confidence of those who work in the food industry. That would be sad because, as I said on Second Reading and earlier in our debate, the agency could be constructive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Desmond Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, what is vital is not just that the food industry has confidence in the Food Standards Agency, but that the public have confidence in it. After all, its primary purpose is to protect the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. The hon. Gentleman is right, but we will not get the public's confidence unless we have the food industry's confidence. We should not set them against each other. The food industry is not the enemy. Everyone is working together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman sat on the Special Select Committee which I chaired and which considered the first draft of the Bill. I cannot recall the food industry having doubts about wanting the FSA or concerns about its viability. We are discussing how the work of the FSA will be put into practice. Food industry doubts about the agency were not put to us in any shape or form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee was chaired effectively by the hon. Gentleman. He knows my views from the evidence sessions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: About the Meat Hygiene Service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a role for an agency to collate information and to distribute it to the food industry. There should be close co-operation between the two. That would be a positive step, but there is a danger that we will set the agency against the food industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for taking samples, surely that is common sense. If we let in a broad band of people, without

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>193</span>
qualifications, the least we can do is ensure that sampling is disciplined, with dates, times and the nature of the sample recorded. The Government cannot oppose amendment No. 29.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Hood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important, in the context of this wide-ranging debate, to put to rest the deliberate confusion that has been created between enforcement powers and the powers of observation contained in clause 11. As my hon. Friend the Minister of State said, the Bill's main function is to improve the protection of public health. In a moment, I shall say why those powers are so important, but I first place on record the fact that they were not systematically opposed during the unprecedented consultation and scrutiny of the draft legislation and the Bill. Indeed, the clause was amended to take account of a reasonable point made by the Food and Drink Federation, which we thought it right to accommodate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are right to probe the purpose of those powers, their extent and their limits. However, it is extremely important for the integrity of our debate that they genuinely accept the guiding principles that underpin the Bill and the clause. We have said repeatedly that, whenever possible, the agency should carry out surveillance voluntarily. The success of voluntary surveillance so far is a recognition by the food industry of the value of co-operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to finish the point. That success does not mean that the powers are not needed. The powers fill an important gap—a gap that could limit our ability to get the full picture on the safety of the food chain. It is not about information that it would be "nice to know". It is about the agency's remit to protect public health in the context of the guiding principles that were subject to such wide discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reassure the Minister for Public Health that we are not opposed to the Food Standards Agency, and we accept the guiding principle of protecting public health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the right hon. Lady mean by "voluntary"? The food industry may have said that when it welcomed the creation of the agency, but volunteering would surely mean that the premises being observed had volunteered to be subject to such observation. If there is no prior warning of a visit, how can the premises be said to have volunteered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to the specific point in a moment. The hon. Lady must accept that we are not creating a new function. We are building on the programme of surveillance to which my hon. Friend the Minister of State referred. That co-operation has yielded about 186,000 samples each year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me make a little progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall set out briefly how the protection of public health and our understanding of some causes of food-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>194</span>
borne illness may be elucidated by the availability of such powers. It will underline the importance of ensuring that we have access to information about possible infectiveness in the food chain, from plough to plate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to repeat what my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden said. We have no problem with the principle of the FSA, but we want to ensure that its functions and powers are reasonable. The word "surveillance" implies some form of heavy-handed action by the agency, some covert operation not on a voluntary basis at all. The word "inspection" sounds more voluntary. I hope that the Minister will make it clear that sample-taking will be presumed and expected to be on a voluntary basis, arranged by consensus between the agency and the person from whose premises samples will be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that Conservative Members protest their support for the FSA, but they must also accept that many of the arguments have been extremely well rehearsed and subjected to unprecedented public scrutiny and consultation. The Bill is the result of that process. I ask them to stop their wilful confusion between the process of enforcement and the process of observation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I want to finish my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The references to the process of observation, which has replaced the previously used term of "surveillance", have been made for specific reasons. That process is legally different and distinct from the process of enforcement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must challenge the Minister. It was her hon. Friends who mixed up enforcement and the power to observe. The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) gave the example of jam tarts and explained how the powers of environmental health officers differed from FSA inspectors examining silage, in that the former do not have the power of observation. That is a small point, but the Minister has been accurate so far, and we may challenge her on other matters. She should not wrongly accuse the Opposition of being confused about that distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that point but shall not dwell further on it, as I want to make some progress on matters of substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are important gaps in our knowledge of the presence of infection in the food chain, on which the powers will give us the opportunity to shed light and gather information. We do not know why the problem of the epidemiology of food-borne pathogens such as E. coli O157 on farms is so serious in Scotland and less so in Northern Ireland. We still have relatively little information about some common organisms such as salmonella and Campylobacter. For a better understanding of them, we need more information on prevalence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also have the capacity to respond quickly to an unexpected emergency and to obtain information that might be essential to protect public health. For example, if a situation analogous to the recent dioxin food crisis in Belgium arose, it might be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0555">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>195</span>
necessary to take samples quickly from nearby premises. In such a situation, most people are willing to co-operate, but what if they are not? How will the safety of the food supply be protected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, let me just finish this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not focus principally on the 186,000 samples that we are already taking, but on making it possible to secure samples that we cannot take under the present voluntary programme, for whatever reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's first point on E. coli demonstrates what I was saying. Surely, it is in everyone's interests to find out why E. coli is worse in Scotland than in England. Would not it be better if the Food Standards Agency's staff, whoever they are, were to work closely with the food producers by appointment, so that they could devote all their time to the visit, rather than turning up arbitrarily when the producer may be busy with a customer or supplier?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Minister's second point, she is muddling observation and enforcement. Enforcement powers are already invested in local government officials for emergencies, so why do we need additional ones for observation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point, revealing support for the guiding principles and the provisions in clause 23 that the agency must act proportionately and with due adherence to an understanding of likely levels of risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members may not be as clear in their opposition as they are pretending to be. If the agency cannot secure samples in its observations to complete its information about the food chain, it will have only a partial picture, which will undermine its ability to do its job properly. Secondly, the only other available means will be through enforcement. Because we want the agency to act in a proportionate way, we have introduced the power to take samples, using powers of entry. Such powers are essential to complete the picture and to obtain information about the extent of possible infection. Unless the agency has those powers, it will be unable properly to discharge its responsibilities under clause 8, which the Committee has approved, to keep track of information about food safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend confirm that the difference in the position in Northern Ireland and in Scotland was that, although both had an outbreak of E. coli 0157, they were different strains? One was a mutant of the other. It was heartening to get those samples and to have them analysed by the scientific community. That gave us an instant answer, which shows the need to get hold of samples and to analyse them quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point. He will be aware that for reasons which we do not understand, the levels of E. coli infection are much higher in Scotland than in Ireland.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
That may well have something to do with different strains, but in order to get to grips with the issue, we need to have scientifically rigorous information.

I come to the question of safeguards, an issue that has been probed by Opposition Members. They have made much—in parody, I think—of what they have described as the draconian nature of these powers. I do not accept what they say. We are serious about the fact that the agency must be seen to act in a proportionate and reasonable way. It will not be out of control; nor will it impinge on anyone's civil liberties. We, as a Government come second to none in the importance that we attach to individual rights. I have listened carefully to all hon. Members on those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the criticisms are exaggerated. For instance, comparisons have been drawn with Customs and Excise, but these powers are different. They relate to the enforcement of legislation. The powers in clause 11 are not about enforcement, in which case evidence is gathered for possible criminal prosecution; they are about information gathering and the sort of evidence that enables us to understand better the origins and pattern of food-borne disease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister realise that her words make the situation infinitely worse? Customs and Excise have such draconian powers to enforce the law. The right hon. Lady is saying that the clause will give the agency the same or more powers, not to enforce the law, but to make observations. That is what is incongruous about her argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the right hon. Gentleman will be aware, enforcement in the context of food safety legislation has a specific meaning, which can lead to criminal prosecution. These powers will not lead to criminal prosecution; they are about inserting an intermediate stage between the process of collecting information by agreement, which happens in the vast majority of cases, and securing the power of entry to take samples, thereby ensuring that the information is complete. While enforcement powers can result in criminal prosecution if failures are found, these powers are about getting a better understanding of problems and using the information to work with the industry to solve them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have listened carefully to the points that have been made in Committee, and we shall further consider whether the safeguards are adequate. It is certainly not our intention that agency officials or contractors appointed by the agency should be able to wander in and out of premises at will, taking samples, documents or anything else. This is a matter of such concern to the Committee that it is worth setting out the stages at which these powers will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surveillance will need to be properly planned in advance, with clearly justified reasons. Except for emergencies, the forward programme of surveillance will be published as it is now. The proposals for surveillance usually come from advisory groups involving experts from industry, who will continue to be involved. Approval for that programme of surveillance will need to be given by the agency's board before specific projects are commissioned. When general approval for the surveillance programme has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>197</span>
been provided, details of the study will be developed. That will set out what has to be done, what samples will be studied, the problem that the information gathering is addressing, who will collect the samples and, importantly, what qualifications those carrying out the collection of the information or samples will be expected to have. At this stage, there will be discussion with relevant professional or industry bodies, to secure their support and to improve the proposal, in many cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next step would be for a sample of businesses to be approached and told when a visit was likely. In the vast majority of cases, we would expect co-operation and there would be no need to use powers of entry. Only in a minority of cases would people not be willing to co-operate, for whatever reason—good or bad—at which point a decision would have to be taken on whether to proceed with the study if the sample group were not representative. So one would not inevitable and necessarily move to the stage of using powers of entry; if the sample were not entirely random, the agency would have to make a judgment about whether the information gathered were sufficiently reliable. If it were decided that it was essential to proceed with the collection of information from certain premises, specific authorisations would be sought from the board of the agency for the use of those powers. Individual authorisations will need to relate to a specific purpose and samples taken only for that purpose. Equally, people will be authorised only if they are suitably qualified to do the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, therefore, there will be clear safeguards although, as members of the Committee will understand, the process would have to be rather quicker in emergencies. I hope that I have made it clear that the clause builds on and strengthens the important process of surveillance, described in the Bill as observations, that currently takes place—overwhelmingly with the co-operation of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal specifically with each of the Opposition amendments. While we would not accept the amendments in the form in which they have been tabled, I accept the principle behind them, which broadly would reflect the good practice underlying the agency's use of powers, which should be reasonable and proportionate. However, we have to strike a balance between ensuring reasonable, proportionate action and ensuring that the legislation is not so prescriptive that its operation is impracticable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 28 would require prior appointments for visits. In practice, that would normally occur and even where there is no cooperation, the business would be forewarned of the intention to visit. However, because we must be able to respond to emergencies, it is not right to stipulate time and date in every case; that would obviously weaken the agency's ability to monitor food safety effectively. The important point is for the agency to strike a balance between providing practical notice, for all the reasons that hon. Members would accept, and not undermining the benefit of visits conducted at short notice. We accept that the agency or the representative of the agency should enter premises only at a reasonable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>198</span>
We cannot accept amendment No. 29 in its present form, which would require the agency to demonstrate the relevance of samples taken. Although that may be desirable in principle, the purpose of gathering information is to establish or refute the relevance of samples. It would therefore not be possible to establish samples until they had been analysed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause already provides for limitations and conditions to be attached to authorisations to take samples. I have said that I am prepared to introduce an amendment to ensure that the authorisation will make clear the purpose for which powers are being exercised, which in practice meets the point of amendment No. 29.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same argument applies to copying records, to which amendment No. 30 relates. Having established that a file or document is generally relevant, it will often be more convenient for the agency and the business to have the entire document, rather than parts of it, copied for further consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement to provide receipts is rare under current sampling regimes, and is not common in practice under other legislation. I have already made clear why the analogy of Customs and Excise that the Opposition tried to draw is not a good example. However, I expect the agency voluntarily to provide a receipt if requested to do so, and the Bill will not prevent that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same arguments apply to amendment No. 73. However, having said that we have no problem with the proposal that the Bill should specify that a receipt will be provided on request, I should be happy to introduce later a suitable amendment to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point remains outstanding. I am also happy to consider the proposition that authorisation for observations should be approved by a member of the agency board, and not delegated to a member of staff. When authorisation is provided, the person conducting the authorised observation will act in the name of the agency, and will be expected to comply with its principles and working practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken up much of the Committee's time in dealing in some detail with many of the points that worried hon. Members. Having done so, I hope that the hon. Member for Meriden will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are obviously keen to proceed; the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) has discussed with me the pace of the debate on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been debating important points. It suddenly became very much clearer from what the right hon. Lady said that observation without prior appointment would not usually take place. It has been made clear that, were a study of the causes of the disproportionate E. coli presentation in Scotland, for example, to be part of a systematic survey, so that premises were inspected systematically and notified, and thus volunteered—if that is the right word—to be part of such an observation. That clarification goes a long way towards the sort of safeguards for which we have been looking. However, given the extent of the safeguards that we have discussed, might it not be better to present them as a code of practice? The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 provides for several codes of practice. The safeguards would be much clearer if they were set out as a code of practice, because reading the Bill does not make matters clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to jump the gun, as we have not reached clause 22 yet, but the agency has to publish a statement of general objectives and practices on the way in which it will work, and that statement must be approved. We must not constrain the agency by sticking in codes of practice. What is implicit in clause 22 covers the hon. Lady's point. We do not want duplication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not seek in any way to duplicate or jump the gun, as the Minister of State said might be the case. Our reading of the Bill and the information that was available gave us no means of knowing that the safeguards were in the pipeline. We feel strongly that a code of practice would be the right way to provide them. In view of the number of concessions that the right hon. Lady has graciously made to us, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 31, in page 5, line 18, leave out, 'if so required,'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 32, in page 5, line 18, after 'authority' insert
	<br><q><p>'and shall state the purpose of his visit'.</p></q></p>
	<p>No. 41, in Clause 14, page 7, line 24, leave out', if so required,'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order that we make progress, I shall be brief and shall hope for an early response from the right hon. Lady before her Back Benchers dig a strong position to defend an area that she will give away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest in amendment No. 31 that the words "if so required" be left out. There would be merit in an officer of the agency, whether a civil servant or a contracted individual, producing his or her authority on every occasion
	<br><q><p>"before exercising any of the powers mentioned in subsection (3)".</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>200</span>
That will protect officers as well. In some cases, there will be allegations that authority was not produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later in the clause, there are powers to deal with people who obstruct officers. If I were a lawyer defending someone accused of that, the first defence that I would use would be, "He thought that he was a fellow off the street. A man wandered into his shop and didn't tell him who he was. He said, 'Stop that,' and the man said, 'I'm an officer of the agency and I'm here to take samples.' He obstructed him, Milord, because he had no idea who the man was."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best protection for the officers of the agency would be on every occasion, as a matter of routine, to produce an authority in the same way in which every copper must. The officers shall have an ID card in case someone demands it, so let them produce it on every occasion to keep things clean, neat and tidy. Perhaps they will carry the new computerised ID card that Ministers in the Home Office will no doubt produce in due course, following the example set by their predecessors. The briefs are on shelves if they want to dig them out; I give them my permission to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 32 would require an officer to state the purpose of a visit. I suspect that the right hon. Lady, the Minister for Public Health, will say in the spirit of her last reply that that will be done in any case. Earlier, she said that the visits would be carefully targeted. In the vast majority of cases there will be a programme of visits, to check, for example, for tartrazine or salmonella; officers will know exactly what they are looking for and that will be agreed generally with the industry. It therefore makes sense for the observer to say, "Here's my authority. I'm from the FSA. This is part of a routine programme of inspections. We are collecting samples of Campylobacter today." In those circumstances, there is a better chance of co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are sensible. We will accept it if the right hon. Lady says that they are not technically correct. I would be happy if she said that she, with help from the parliamentary draftsmen, would table some amendments on Report that incorporated the principles into the clause but with slightly different wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the right hon. Gentleman accepts what I have already said about the clause and the improvements, or clarifications that we are happy to introduce. We would not expect anyone to admit someone from the Food Standards Agency without identification, any more than we expect people to admit the gas man or the person from the electricity board. Clearly, showing identification is part of how a public servant, or anyone entering premises, should explain his presence. When authorisation is provided to secure the power of entry, the purpose of that visit will be set out clearly in such authorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those clarifications, I hope that right hon. Gentleman is happy to withdraw his amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not entirely. What would be the effect of dropping the words "if so required" from the clause? Would the effect be deleterious? Would it limit the power of the officers? I think not. Leaving those words in the clause could cause some doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0558">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>201</span>
The Minister says, rightly, that on every occasion, an officer will be expected to produce identification. That is what I took the phrase "produce his authority" to mean. If someone says that he is an officer of the authority, I assume that he has the power to exercise his functions. The Minister's interpretation of authority seems to be that the officer will produce a type of warrant saying that he has been authorised by the chairman or the board to look for tartrazine in the company's orange juice, and therefore his functions on that day will merely be those related to the inspection of orange juice and looking for the chemical tartrazine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not expect the authority to be that specific. I hope that the right hon. Lady will consider seriously removing the words "if so required", and perhaps obtain legal advice on the consequences of doing so. I can see no harm in dropping those words from the Bill, so that on every occasion the officer routinely produces an authority without quibble. Even in an emergency, I would expect such authority to be produced for a recalcitrant food shop owner. That removes the chance for lawyers to argue later that the officer did not produce evidence of identity or an authority and, as the samples were improperly taken, that the Government can be sued. By keeping it legal and above board by producing an authority, the officers will be in a stronger position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that she is giving me assurances, but she has not convinced me that the words "if so required" are essential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been concerned to pin down clearly and precisely how the powers will be used, and in what circumstances. I cannot accept the right hon. Gentleman's insistence on the amendment. If someone from the Food Standards Agency turned up, he would be unable to cross the threshold unless he produced evidence of authority. It may be a programme of observations, involving repeated visits, so the person will be already known. Removing the phrase "if so required" would create a process that was unduly rigid, prescriptive and inflexible, which is what we want to avoid. I have made the spirit in which we intend these provisions to operate abundantly clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the right hon. Lady, but I disagree with her on a little point. It would not prevent someone from crossing the threshold if the words were removed; it would prevent him from exercising any of the powers—I accept that. The only point in the Minister's explanation that I do accept is that if the person is well known and makes regular visits, it would be silly to say, "Hello Jim. You are from the Food Standards Agency, but I need to see your warrant once again."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not press the amendment today, but we may need to return to the matter. It makes a strong case for the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden that for clauses 10 and 11, a code of practice is essential. It could set out all the modus operandi that the Minister told us about this morning. If police officers can be given general powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, but then must have detailed codes of practice on taking samples or fingerprints, keeping records, giving receipts, and so on, it makes sense in this Bill as well. Otherwise, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>202</span>
agency will be sued time and again because some organisations will say that it broke natural justice by taking samples when no authority to do so was shown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A code of practice could make it clear to industry what was expected of it, and the level and type of cooperation that it should give, and make it clear to officers how to use their powers. It would also keep the lawyers out of it. I hear the Minister, but I am not entirely convinced. This may not be the time to pursue the issue, although we may need to come back to it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we can dispense with these amendments relatively quickly. They could be embraced in a code of practice successfully, along with the many practical safeguards that we are seeking. The amendments are about the samples that are taken from premises and we want to safeguard what happens to them. We have explained at length our concerns about possible risks in granting these powers of observation, and what could happen if they are abused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may like to come with me to my very reputable butcher, Lashfords, which specialises in sausages, for which people come from far and wide. My predecessor supplied these esteemed sausages regularly to the previous Prime Minister. If there were customers in the shop when food safety officers decided to make a so-called observation and requested different trays of sausages to be removed as samples for their investigations, some of these customers would be a little concerned and might contemplate changing the order that they were about to place. It could soon get round the village that the Food Standards Agency had visited Lashfords and taken away the entire stock of sausages and—regrettably—that information could get into the local paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The officers may decide, on reflection, that they do not need all the sausages and discard some of them hastily, without much thought, into the bins outside. The press, being diligent and scrupulous will then come looking for the source of the reason for the investigation and acquire a quantity of those samples. They may then make their own investigations of samples, resulting in further rumours on whether these esteemed sausages are something in which the public should have confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I use that rather amusing example simply to draw the Minister's attention to the problems that could arise if the legislation is not tightly defined. What will happen to samples to prevent the example that I described from happening? We must not undermine the confidence of the industry with which the FSA will have to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendments relate to an aspect of the operation of clause 11 in relation to which we listened carefully to the Food and Drink Federation and very much respected the importance of safeguarding in the course of collecting samples what would be regarded as trade secrets. In practice, that will apply to how samples are collected, to information derived from having access to samples, and, common sense would suggest, to their disposal. I underline the care that has been taken in drafting the clause to take account of that point. Neither of the amendments add any safeguards, and I ask the hon.

I remain slightly worried about whether common sense will always prevail in such cases. The media report far too many examples of common sense not providing a sufficiently strong safeguard.

	<div class='title'>MONITORING OF ENFORCEMENT ACTION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 34, in page 6, line 14, leave out subsection (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now reach another important clause, and this is the place and the time for the Opposition to raise their anxieties. In opening the discussion on the clause, I re-emphasise that Opposition Members are under no illusion and are not confused about the distinction between a visit made for observation purposes and another, substantially more serious sort of visit that may be necessary, if I have understood the clause correctly, in fulfilling a separate role of monitoring the enforcement authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause gives the FSA the power to monitor set standards and to audit the performance of all enforcement authorities; it will enable the FSA to monitor the enforcer. We are worried about the power that the clause gives the agency to monitor and direct the enforcer, and in some cases, to take over enforcement. The amendment is designed to probe the extent of that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>204</span>
The amendment must be read in conjunction with the schedules attached to the Bill. To understand the extent of the agency's monitoring and enforcement role, we need to turn to schedule 4, which is entitled "Minor and consequential amendments". The schedule amends section 6 of the Food Safety Act 1990, which, in its current form, permits the Minister to direct Ministers to assume any of the functions currently carried out by local authorities. The minor and consequential amendment is the insertion of the words "the Food Standards Agency". It is important to consider schedule 4 because, by that simple amendment, the provision will allow not the Minister, but the Secretary of State for Health—without reference to Parliament—to direct the FSA to take over the powers of local authorities, whether it be the routine inspection of food premises or any allied function. In one fell swoop, it will be possible for the FSA to take over the devolved role of the local enforcement authority. We are concerned that that situation could lead to abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, that power is distinct from the emergency powers set out elsewhere in the Food Safety Act 1990—the so-called default powers that relate to local authorities who are failing in their duties. We want to amend the clause because of that change, and also because of our concern that local authorities will be sidelined from their existing role in enforcing food safety standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not set out how the performance of local enforcement authorities will be measured. If the agency is to audit, monitor and set standards for local enforcement authorities, should these standards not be set out more clearly in the Bill? I imagine that the present enforcement authorities would like to know by what criteria their performance will be measured—what will be judged by the FSA to be good or bad performance. If those criteria are not clearly set out, it will be possible to avoid proper measurement and the whole process could become too objective. If we avoid setting targets for enforcement authorities, it will be difficult for those authorities to establish how or when they are likely to fail and to suffer the indignity of the FSA coming in over their heads to carry out the task with which they were formally entrusted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause should be more specific about that, if the agency is supposed to come in and take over the role of a failing authority. We should not adopt a softly, softly approach to food safety standards. I invite the Government to take the wolf out of the sheep's clothing and make their intentions clear. We look forward to hearing the Minister's remarks on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly hope that the Minister will respond to the considerable concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) on Second Reading about the enforcement powers of the agency. If we read the Bill in conjunction with the amendment to the Food Safety Act 1990 contained in schedule 4, it certainly supports my hon. Friend's interpretation of the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a brief intervention. I am pleased that the hon. Lady said that amendment No. 34 was a probing amendment—if it were agreed to, there would be disquiet throughout the nation about the fact that the FSA could not make enforcement authorities publish a report when it felt that something was wrong. We should remove risks from the food chain and raise the public's confidence in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady discussed monitoring. She may recall that the Special Select Committee that examined the original draft of the Bill considered that matter in detail. It took evidence and made recommendations about monitoring local authorities—or perhaps I should call them enforcement authorities. It recommended that monitoring should not be mechanistic or, in relation to the number of inspections, too procedural, and that inspections should not be too closely related to outputs or to the number of reported cases of food poisoning. It became evident to us that multi-disciplinary indicators, which were based on best practice that was developed by agencies in conjunction with local authorities, would be more suitable than the present arrangement. There have been changes during the past few months. At one stage, it was proposed to the Special Select Committee that only the number of visits that were made to premises should be taken into account, but we also need to consider whether one premises is a higher risk than another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are five categories of risk, with A being the highest risk. The Special Select Committee considered the fact that although two premises might have similar practices in relation to the food chain, they might be in different categories. That might be because the practices, which may relate to staff training, for example, were not as good in one premises as they were in another. We strongly recommended that the Government should take that into account in relation to the FSA's functions. The Government's response to the Special Select Committee's report made it clear that they were positive about taking on board our arguments about different indicators and about the need to remove risk from the food chain. I refer Committee members to recommendation 12 of paragraph 12 of the Government's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, and, I hope, other Committee members, have read the very good report by the Select Committee on Agriculture on food safety. Its evidence made it clear that different local authorities might have different enforcement practices. The impact of that on our food chain should concern us all. The evidence of the Special Select Committee confirmed the findings of the Select Committee on Agriculture. The Government did well to respond to our concerns about enforcement and the indicators that would be used and published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister agree with my understanding of what would happen if the amendment were agreed to? If the FSA could not direct an enforcement authority to publish a report, would people in retail outlets and consumers not have the right to know about a bad local authority that was found not to be enforcing food standards properly? A fundamental issue is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
involved. Deleting subsection (5) would effectively keep matters under wrap, although we want the FSA to do the opposite—we should ensure that all such matters are open and that people have more confidence in the food chain than they currently do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Hood, for my earlier outburst, which was unprofessional. I was frustrated beyond belief. Agreements made through the usual channels mean that our proceedings are controlled by the Opposition. If they did not make four speeches on every amendment, we could avoid repetitious speeches and make progress. That was my point. If we do not get a chance to discuss every aspect of the Bill, it will not be the Government's responsibility. It is our intention to be freely available to answer all the Opposition's questions, but there is a time constraint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not making a criticism because, in this respect, the hon. Member for Meriden did not refer to amendment No. 34. I accept that clauses 12 and 13 relate to the same process and give the FSA new powers. We have discussed existing powers that are being transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Health to the FSA and, although there are some changes, in general the powers are the same. However, we are now debating new powers. We have made it clear that the agency will perform three new functions over and above work that already takes place. It is to set standards for local authority enforcement, to monitor those standards and, if required, to take action where there are failures. This is new territory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) responded well to the debate, and I have only a couple of points to add. We are aware that the agency could find an abject failure in a democratically elected authority. However, the clauses have the full support of local government. The hon. Member for Meriden implied that there was criticism of the powers in local government, although she did not give an example of that. I should make it clear that local government welcome the powers in the Bill. We do not want the agency to be like the Audit Commission, which makes a beanfeast of the numbers of the things that it counts. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley said, the number of visits is no indication of quality. Some of the Audit Commission's visits are rubbish. It clocks them up because they are easy. We are not interested in that. It is the quality of the visit that counts, which we repeatedly made clear to the Special Select Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 12(2) provides the power to set standards of enforcement. That is not the same as prescribing the number of visits. The agency will determine that. Whitehall does not know best. The idea that everything should be included in the Bill is nonsense. The agency, in conjunction with local government and the enforcement authorities, is in a better position than Members of Parliament to decide such matters. We might prescribe something in the Bill that turns out to be impractical, but which cons the public for a short time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that we want to avoid what happened in Westminster council, which did not visit 117 restaurants because they were not on its list. In those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>207</span>
circumstances, it was difficult to enforce standards. We must ensure that, to enforce standards, we know where all food premises are located. It would be an abject mistake to accept amendment No. 34. However, we respect democratic local government. It is the key enforcer of standards in the food chain, a view that we have maintained since we drafted the White Paper. We had to ask, as Parliament did when it established the Meat Hygiene Service, whether enforcement powers should be removed from local government and given to the FSA to produce a centralised enforcement body. It did not take more than five minutes to conclude that expert skills are applied on a daily basis across the country by enforcement officers who go into premises, by and large with consent, on behalf of the public, and that it would be damaging to smash that up. We decided that it would be best to leave enforcement powers with democratic local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are conscious of the fact that there are 300–400 local authorities. Budgetary pressures dictate the importance that we give to this issue. Although we believe that enforcement should not be uniform, it does need to be more consistent. After all, taxpayers want the food chain protected. They pay council tax and justifiably deserve consistency in the policing of food chain. Failures must be examined. The matter of taking power was raised and we shall discuss the schedule later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power for the Secretary of State to take over the role is contained in the Food Safety Act 1990. The schedule merely adds the Food Standards Agency to that list. The FSA may have a problem with enforcement that could not be solved. By definition, it is a powerful sanction to remove the enforcement power, so that point would be a long way down the line of failure. We are not saying that that should be done from the centre. The FSA will contract the neighbouring local authority to do the job if it has a good track record and people available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some parts of the country, local authorities already co-operate on enforcement. In the Warwickshire and Worcestershire area, three or four local authorities have an almost combined operation because they have the expertise, no cross-boundary disputes and no budgetary disputes. It is a model that could be applied to the rest of the country. There has been no interference from outside, only co-operation. Only when there is abject failure or lack of responsibility by a local authority to meet its duties would it be necessary for the Secretary of State or the Food Standards Agency to take over the matter or to ask another local authority to contract for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public would want us to have that sanction and local authorities are content for the agency to have it, because it is almost the nuclear option. I cannot envisage circumstances being so poor because there would have to have been a list of failures and they would have been open to the public and the electorate in the area. We must not allow the situation to arise in which the FSA knows about problems, details the serious cases in its annual report, but cannot require a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>208</span>
local authority to report to its electorate on the matters that have arisen. Most local authorities will want to do that because they will want to put matters right and to boast to their electorates that they have perceived the problem. There is nothing wrong with finding problems, but it is wrong to refuse to find solutions. We are not seeking to name and shame and I ask the hon. Member for Meriden to withdraw the amendment because it goes to the heart of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My problem, Mr. Hood, is that you may say that the clause has been sufficiently discussed. Clauses 12 and 13 are a parcel and an amendment has been tabled to clause 13, a debate on which may settle the Opposition's anxieties. I hope that what I have said about amendment No. 34 and the agency's take-over powers satisfies the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some concern was expressed to the Special Select Committee by local government about the powers to be taken by the agency. The Select Committee, in the report, stated:
	<br><q><p>"Local authorities are of course anxious that such powers are not used lightly—that they are indeed seen as powers of 'last resort' … As the LGA spokesman pointed out to the Committee, 'if a function is to be removed from a democratically elected local authority … then it seems to … [be] … something that the Minister obviously on advice ought to do directly'."</p></q>
We shall come to enforcement in a later schedule, but we recommended that the final decision to invoke the power should remain with the Secretary of State after receiving advice from the agency. How does the Minister of State expect that to work in practice? The matter is similar to one that we debated half an hour ago, when the Minister's words were more reassuring than the Bill. We have the potential for a central, non-elected authority overruling democratically elected councillors and officials, bossing them from the centre. That fear has been expressed by local authorities. The Minister of State is saying that that is a parody and will not happen. I should like to know how it will work because I am not convinced that the common sense that both Ministers believe in will prevail. There is a risk that, as with all government agencies, empires get built which have their own dynamic and agenda, and they increase power to the centre. Surely, the hon. Gentleman must see that a central agency with a large budget will ultimately have more power than local authorities, which in many areas have fewer people and smaller budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have an effective system of food safety enforcement run by local government According to the figures that I have seen, we have a good system that works well compared with those of the rest of Europe. We do not want to undermine confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That contradicts what the Minister said. Reassuringly, he said that much enforcement is

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>209</span>
better conducted at a local level by people who understand what is happening on the ground, a view that I endorse. We have a pretty good system that works well. Obviously, there has been the odd horrific exception, but my fear is that we are giving grounds for the establishment of a central national hygiene service with, ultimately, powers arbitrarily to overrule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend would be much happier to have reports of inspections of the food industry published if Labour Members were asking for inspections of doctors' and other medical practices to be similarly published so that we could see who was doing the best job and who was failing patients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and we know that the resistance of Labour Members to such a proposal is marked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To finish the point, I see a danger in creating a central agency that could take powers to itself and arbitrarily overrule local government but that would not necessarily deliver better food safety. That fear runs counter to the Minister's reassurances. If he explained how enforcement over local authorities might work in a specific case, I would be grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are getting into uncharted waters and that is probably my fault. Clause 12 is about the monitoring of enforcement action, not about the taking over of the powers contained in schedule 3. Those powers, to which the Special Select Committee also referred, are the powers of the Minister under the Food Safety Act 1990, to which reference has already been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 42 of that Act states:
	<br><q><p>"Where the Minister is satisfied that … a food authority has failed … he may by order empower another food authority".</p></q>
We shall add to that "the Food Standards Agency", although it might be another local authority that takes over the default powers. Those are powers of operation rather than monitoring—they are about doing the job. The purpose of clause 12 is to check on the local authorities' monitoring, as was proposed by recommendation 11 of the Special Select Committee on which the hon. Member for North Shropshire served.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers may empower one authority to take over the powers of another under the default powers of the Food Safety Act 1990. Action will not simply be taken by the agency; any action will be concerned with undertaking work and employing enforcement staff. In clause 12, we are setting up powers for the agency to monitor enforcement action which is, under section 42 of the Food Safety Act 1990, the nuclear option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have put our views of local authority enforcement on the record and do not really wish to add to them. By and large, local authority enforcement is a class act and should be respected. We want to be able to monitor it effectively on a national basis because no one currently does that. The Audit Commission does not do that—that is not its function and its reports are useless when considering such issues as food standards. If the hon. Member for North Shropshire wants me say that we are not planning a national enforcement authority, I am happy to say that. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>210</span>
establishment of such an authority is not implicit in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for looking ahead, as I invited him to do in my opening speech. Taking a forward look at the clauses—some of which are inextricably linked with each other—that cover the extent of the Food Standards Agency's powers is important for our understanding of how the agency's powers are to be used under clause 34. It was significant to hear the Minister's view that the interrelationship between the agency and the enforcing authority is best managed at the local level. That will probably save us time later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Local Government Association is at ease with the current drafting of the clause. That is partly because it would be unnatural for the LGA to think in terms of authorities failing. It would be pessimistic if it did not believe that its members are extremely successful in carrying out their roles. The nuclear option therefore seems remote to it. The Minister cited the example of Warwickshire and Worcestershire working together. That is, of course, a voluntary arrangement. At the risk of drawing attention to the location of our respective constituencies, it is possible to imagine a little more friction if the Birmingham and Solihull authorities were invited to take on an enforcing role for each other, because we know that they are very competitive. Realistically, where the overseeing of one authority by another authority—following the monitoring exercise that has demonstrated that one of them is failing—is unwelcome, one could envisage much more resistance from the local authority concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we debated local government reform earlier this year, we considered a parallel situation in which a local authority is failing on a set of clearly defined performance targets under the best value initiative. In such a case, it was envisaged that a successful authority would be brought in to do the job that the failing authority was patently not performing well. When we debated the matter, we tried to ensure safeguards for the failed authority, which would give it a chance to come back and take on—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>211</span>
I welcome the Minister's words on clause 12 because, in a sense, clause 13 is closely associated with it. He said that the agency would only take over the powers of enforcement in cases where a particular local authority had failed. I hope that that would be a long way down the line, because it must be in the interests of local democracy to keep those enforcement powers with the local authority for as long as possible. I expect the agency to go to considerable lengths to consult a local authority that appears in its opinion to be failing in its duty before it takes over those powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's remarks on the matter. To some extent the amendment is a probing amendment; it seeks to probe how far the agency can use those powers when it takes over the functions of the local authority. What provisions are to be made within the agency about the possibility of copied documents going astray? What safeguards will apply to leaks emanating from the authority when the documents, some of which will contain sensitive information, have been copied? What safeguards will apply within the agency, which will have gone into the local authority and copied documents that are commercially confidential? What sanctions will apply to a member of the agency who breaches the clause? What will happen to officials who leak confidential information obtained by the agency under it? The amendment is simple, and seeks to probe the Government's intentions. Will the Minister explain the safeguards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Sally Keeble 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Northampton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify the Opposition's position on provision of information? The amendment appears to run counter to their previous argument that all information should be published—which I think was advanced by the hon. Member for Meriden. It also runs counter to the remarks made by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, who suggested that the information should not be made public. Will the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a useful intervention. The Opposition are generally in favour of transparency and openness. However, we are talking about the obtainment of information from local authorities, in respect of which they may have used any of the powers that they possess. Copied documents may contain commercial confidentialities, public safety information and so on. Later during our consideration of the Bill we shall discuss a strong public interest clause. All information should be published unless a strong public interest is at stake, when it may not be appropriate for it to be publicly available. I have said in previous sittings that there should be a presumption that information should be published. Public interest will have to be considered, however, and publication will not always be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would have happened in Lanarkshire, where a local authority environmental health officer inspected a butcher's shop and said that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>212</span>
it was being run properly, when, in point of fact, there were problems? Many people contracted E. coli, and an investigation had to be conducted to disclose the details. My understanding is that the amendment would have short-circuited that process. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the Food Standards Agency should be able to obtain the information that a butcher's shop is not being run properly or that the local authority is not inspecting it properly, and just to sit on it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely why the agency is there—to consider the merits of each individual case In cases of emergency, it will need to get information into the public domain very quickly. Other cases will arise in which it is not appropriate to take such action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be quickly ruled out of order if I pursue this argument too far. The amendment is specific. It concerns the agency's ability to copy and pass on the records that it receives from local authority enforcement agencies. That is a very narrow and specific matter, and we do not need to make a huge meal of it. The amendment is a simple probing amendment. We need to know how the Minister envisages the powers working and what he will do to ensure that leaks do not occur within the agency of information that it does not want to be in the public domain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept at the outset that this is a probing amendment, as the hon. Member for Cotswold said. To answer his last question, I am sure that the agency will take all the steps that previous Governments and this Government have been taken every day of the week to stem leaks—with various degrees of success. Obviously, there are difficulties when leaks occur. However, I can answer the hon. Gentleman's question only by saying that because the agency is a Government Department, procedures will be put in place to ensure that it adheres to all the codes of practice and rules that relate to the release of documentation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cotswold made a point in order to probe us, and I accept that. The Food Standards Agency will obtain documents from local authorities, as it will from other bodies; however, we are talking about enforcement authorities. Such information will be the agency's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not yet reached clause 19, which states that the agency will have the power to publish any information that it holds, even if some was obtained on a commercially confidential basis. However, the agency would have to jump over a series of hurdles before it could do that, because it would be subject to massive sanctions if it got things wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency cannot publish private information on personnel in local government, because the Data Protection Act 1998 covers such information. It would have to consider the public interest before it published anything that it obtained from any source—that is part of its raison d'être as an open and transparent body. That is why we avoided placing a duty on it to publish all its information, as my hon.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>213</span>
Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) reminded the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that local authority officers and councillors would be concerned about the agency publishing confidential internal records. Again, however, it would take that step only after jumping over the hurdles in clause 19 in the public interest. It would be the norm for the agency to publish advice to Ministers as a default, but it would have to be in the public interest for it to publish advice from anyone else. It would, therefore, have to respect the confidentiality of personal data.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Records that are obtained as a result of audit visits would not, in most cases, be affected by commercial confidentiality. Many local authority enforcements are in the public domain, but they are not always reported. I am in favour of freedom of information, but an enormous amount of information that is publicly available—particularly in the local government sector—is never written about or picked up by journalists, mainly because no one spoon-fed them by putting it in a press release. Such information is in the public domain and much of the information that the agency will obtain will be. The agency will certainly not go round being unreasonable because it will be constrained by normal administrative law in what it can do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have satisfied the hon. Member for Cotswold. The amendment was a genuine probe. My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North was perhaps a bit unkind about it, and I do not see it as contradicting previous views. We need to know what the agency will do with the information that it obtains. There are constraints on what it can do, even though we want it to be open and transparent. It is, however, not possible to go into detail about what the agency will do with leaks, except to say that I am sure that it will be set up in such a way that leaks do not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reassured by the Minister's comments. This is a case of suck-it-and-see—when the agency comes into operation, we shall see whether it uses its powers reasonably. No doubt there will be judicial review cases if it does not.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's helpful remarks on clause 12, which is related to clauses 13 and 14, have allowed us to move at a considerable pace. Clause 14 is inextricably linked to clauses 12 and 13. It relates to the power of entry that is practical for monitoring enforcement action. I would encourage the LGA to read 	<i>Hansard</i> closely, because it will reveal how the Minister envisages the power working and what consequences may ensue. That will allow enforcement authorities to have their eyes open to what relationship the FSA intends to have with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendments is to define in more detail the power of entry. We feel strongly that the agency is an amorphous being and that the line of accountability for the authorisation of the power of entry needs to be clear. Amendment No. 36 proposes that the chairman or the deputy chairman should be cited as the person who may authorise an individual to exercise the powers in the Bill. We want the line of accountability to be obvious. If, as a result of a serious episode, there is an inquiry into the operation of the agency and the enforcement authority that it has monitored, it must be clear who has taken the decisions, for what reasons and when.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 37 relates to the individual who is authorised to exercise the powers. We had a lengthy debate about what qualifications the agency should require for people who carry out inspection and monitoring functions. Given that an FSA officer who is monitoring enforcements may encounter a serious situation, it is important that he has the right qualifications to carry out the task as effectively and efficiently as possible. The enforcement authority that is being monitored and the general public must have confidence in how the exercise is undertaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concern in amendment No. 40 is that any accompanying person should also be qualified. Without constraints on who the accomplice should be, the agency will be open to the risk of common sense not prevailing. I referred to the American Food and Drug Administration which, in some respects, is an example of best practice. I have since discovered that the FDA was at one time found to be corrupt. We do not want that to happen to the new agency. One reason for debating the Bill so carefully is to ensure that only the highest standards will be applied. Failure to specify the qualification of the person accompanying the authorised individual could be dangerous. There would be terrible consequences if a member of the press gained access as an accompanying individual to an enforcement decision involving business premises or an enforcing authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should learn lessons from existing food safety and food standard agencies and more closely define who should authorise and carry out the power of entry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We move from clause 11, which relates merely to observations, to clause 14, which relates to powers of enforcement, and is, therefore, a much more serious clause. Our amendments to clauses 11 and 14 may appear to be somewhat similar, but those to clause 14 are much more important. Amendments Nos. 37 and 40 relate to the fact that any official who visits a premises with enforcement

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>215</span>
powers should have relevant qualifications. The Minister must explain why he thinks that someone who carries out an enforcement action need not have the relevant qualifications or training. If the agency delegates functions to another agency, would it have to have appropriate qualifications?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unacceptable if no one in the agency had sufficient rank to instruct people to carry out an enforcement action. Amendment No. 36 is intended to establish whether the chairman or the deputy chairman would be involved. If not, who will instruct officials to carry out the enforcement action? This is a serious matter—as we have already discussed, the FSA will have huge powers. From which level in the agency will people be instructed to carry out an enforcement action?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency will have a huge bureaucracy, but we do not yet know which levels of staff it will contain or which enforcement functions it will carry out. The amendments are intended to establish how the Minister envisages the system working. I do not know, Mr. Hood, whether you intend to have a clause stand part debate. We shall later discuss other aspects of the enforcement power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does this wide clause involve the same fines as clause 11, and how does it compare with that clause? Either the fines in clause 14 are too low or those in clause 11 are too high—I suspect that the latter is the case. We did not discuss that when we considered clause 11, but it would be interesting to hear the Minister's observations on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause could help to create an agency with huge and overbearing powers. The agency's enforcement
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>216</span>
power should be used only as a last resort. We have already discussed at length the agency's power to carry out observations. I hope that it will provide advice and help but that it will not act with a heavy hand. If the agency fulfils its functions properly, it will provide advice, take samples, make observations and have discussions with the relevant organisation, but, except in dire emergencies, it should not be necessary to use the enforcement power.

In a sense, amendments Nos. 36, 37 and 40 probe the Government's intentions. When the Minister responds to them, he should give us a general idea of the way in which, and under what circumstances, the enforcement function will work. We shall no doubt consider these matters at great length, and I hope that he will reply in detail this afternoon. I shall conclude now, and give him the opportunity to start his response to the amendments, which he is always keen to do. If he fails to satisfy, I may, with the leave of the Committee, return to these matters later in our debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that the title of clause 14 states:

It does not involve powers of entry for an enforcement. As I shall make clear this afternoon, its provisions will apply not to the people whom he discussed but to others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
