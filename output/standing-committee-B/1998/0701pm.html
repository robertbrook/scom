	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 11, in page 2, leave out lines 11 to 13 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(b) establish a register of interests of members of the Agency which shall be published annually'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 75, in page 2, line 11, leave out from 'appoint' to 'interest' in line 12 and insert 'should divest himself of any'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come now to the vexed question of interests. That important matter was referred to briefly in some of the amendments discussed this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of the amendments, it is important that the Food Standards Agency is seen to be as independent and transparent as possible if it is to gain the trust and public confidence that the Government expect, but that will be inextricably linked with the interests of the members of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has had a lengthy gestation and I have examined the report of the Special Select Committee that considered the draft Bill. I was not a member of that Committee, but some of my hon. Friends were and it identified a possible weakness concerning members' interests. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend that at second reading the Minister should make explicit the criteria by which members of the Commission are selected and interests are declared."</p></blockquote>
I proceeded to pay great attention to what the Minister said on Second Reading and sought a response on the Special Select Committee's recommendation. The Minister stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All applicants will have to declare all personal interests or connections, and the appointment panels will be charged with probing potential conflicts of interest very carefully."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say something that is important to our discussion of the amendments this morning. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I must make it clear that there are no specific interests— commercial or public—which would automatically exclude any candidate."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 21 June 1999; Vol. 333, c.787.]</p></blockquote>
That is important because the position concerning interests remains unclear. The explanatory notes contain some contradictions and we hope that they will be resolved during discussion of our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
The explanatory note on clause 2 refers to financial and other interests and gives the example of someone with a shareholding in a food manufacturing company. That seems in line with the Minister's position, but does not mean that any such interest will automatically disqualify a person from appointment as a member. That sits awkwardly with the advertisement that we discussed earlier this morning which states clearly that integrity and freedom from conflict of interest will be essential. Our view is that potential applicants for the posts of chairman, deputy chairman and ordinary board members might be deterred because it is hard to guarantee complete freedom from conflict of interest if someone's interest pertains to the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of our amendments is to reinforce the Minister's position that someone with financial or other interests should not be debarred from applying to become a member of the Food Standards Agency. That is all the more important because people who have relevant skills and expertise might be put off applying. The vexed question of whether interests should be permitted was highlighted when the Minister for the Environment suspended members of a statutory body on genetically modified food because of their connections as scientists with certain companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is simply not true. No one has been suspended from any Government scientific advisory committee. The hon. Lady has put it on the record that the Minister for the Environment suspended people from an advisory committee because of their interests, but no one has been sacked, removed or suspended from the committee in the way that she has stipulated. We must get our facts right because those committee members are working on behalf of the public interest for no salary. They are not Government people. The hon. Lady's words could be taken out of context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall have to agree to differ. The principle at the core of our discussion is whether someone whose interests are inextricably linked with their relevant expertise in the work of the agency, will be allowed to be considered for, and appointed to, the agency, and to participate in its important work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My example is valid. Genetic modification is a new technology that is complex and difficult for many people to understand. Given that the Food Standards Agency will be the regulatory authority for GM food, it is all the more important that people who have relevant expertise in this novel technology are considered for and appointed to it. That will further the work of the agency and ensure that the best and most able people are appointed to enable it to operate effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned that the job description—I realise that it is now available, although I have not had time to read it since entering the Room—contains degrees of specialism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ian Gibson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Select Committee on Science and Technology spoke to Dr. John Beringer on that very subject. He left the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
committee because, like other people who were on it, he had served his time. The problem was that too many people left at the same time because of the specified term, which may have been three or five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We asked the Consumers Association and other consumer groups whether they thought that the committees were biased. They were clear that there was no bias and that the discussions were proper and learned. There was no problem with anyone representing a specific interest. The Consumers Association thought that the composition of the committees was perfect. It also seems that people were able to participate 110 per cent, in the committees' work. The model exists, so there is no need to harp on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman on some points. Scientists would be greatly affronted by the suggestion that, because their research work had been funded by commercial companies at the cutting edge of a new technology, they would be unscrupulous if appointed to a public body. Our amendment specifies: "notwithstanding" those interests. We are trying to ensure that people with expertise that is relevant to the work of the Food Standards Agency are not debarred or put off by the advertisement, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Integrity and freedom from conflicts of interests will be essential."</p></blockquote>
It is easy to see how an expert who is partly or fully remunerated by a food manufacturing company or technology company might, on reading that advertisement, say, "Well, that rules me out then, doesn't it?" It is clear from the sequence to which I referred earlier—from the Special Select Committee, through Second Reading, to today's debate—that there is a considerable risk that, as drafted, the provision may encourage people with apposite skills to rule themselves out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to amendment No. 11. We want the Bill to reinforce the point—which the Minister made on Second Reading—that people with such expertise should not be debarred, notwithstanding their interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Sally Keeble 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Northampton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the Opposition will no longer object when highly competent people are appointed to public positions, regardless of interests in, for example, Sainsbury's, or donations made to the Labour party? In future, will the hon. Lady support appointments on the basis of merit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the wrong inference to draw from my comments. I do not want to be drawn into a discussion on individuals who have recently been appointed to important public positions to do a single job. There is a marked difference between working for a public body for—as the advertisement states—three to four days or six to seven days a month, and a public position that is a full-time job, upon which one's interests will have great bearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
Amendment No. 11 should be read with amendment No. 10. For the integrity and transparency of the agency to be publicly recognised, there must be a proper register of interests. Amendment No. 11 would reinforce that, so that members of the public could find out about agency members' interests. It is important to strengthen that aspect of the Bill, which does not offer an adequate guarantee of propriety. We are keen for the agency to be squeaky clean. That will be important for the restoration of public confidence in food safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to paragraph 9 of schedule 1, which refers to the register of interests, because it makes clear our perception of the weakness. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Agency may regulate its own procedure"</p></blockquote>
by maintaining
	<br><blockquote><p>"a system for the declaration and registration of private interests".</p></blockquote>
That is too vague. A system of registration is not the same as a clear, statutory register of interests, and the amendment is designed to toughen up that provision. The register should be refreshed annually. Board members' interests could change during the course of their appointment to the agency, so it is important that the register is updated. If the Government are unwilling to accept the amendment, we would like to know what they consider to be a system of registering interests. The public will want to know what is meant by such a system. One could envisage a system remaining cloistered, with members of the agency telling each other their interests, without that information reaching the public domain. It is important that a register of interests should be freely accessible to members of the public, and to all groups with an interest in food standards and food safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two amendments should be considered together and we hope that the Government will be receptive to them. In practical terms, as the Minister stated on Second Reading, we do not expect board members who, according to the job advertisement, will be expected to work on a part-time basis, to be remunerated as for a full-time position. Therefore, unless they are especially fortunate, they will require remuneration from other sources that may bring other interests with them. Such interests would not be incompatible with their properly carrying out the job to which they have been appointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, we do not, en passant, think it necessary for members of the agency to divest themselves of those interests in order to perform their role in an upright way, strictly in accordance with the rules laid down for conduct and standards of behaviour in public life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Peter Brand 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Isle of Wight)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is reasonable to group the amendments together for the purpose of our discussion and Liberal Democrats support the spirit of amendment No. 11. However, our amendment No. 75 runs contrary to the aim of amendment No. 10, which we shall oppose. I shall seek guidance on when to press amendment No. 75 to a vote, if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
The purpose of the Bill is to set up a Food Standards Agency that will be independent, authoritative and trustworthy. The Government have wisely recognised that politicians are not always the most trusted people. In most MORI polls, we now rank below estate agents in the public esteem, which probably has more to do with the excellence of estate agents than with the behaviour of politicians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, although there is a clear need to divest politicians of direct control of the Food Standards Agency, it is just as important to ensure that there is no public perception of vested industrial interests in it. The Special Select Committee that considered the draft Bill took evidence on those issues. I am in favour of the Irish model, in which people serving on a committee must divest themselves of current remuneration and financial interests in the industry in which they have acquired their relevant expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) asked a question about quorums, which has not yet been answered. With a limited number of members on the board—it is to be 12 plus two—I foresee occasions on which three or four members may have to declare an interest and, therefore, leave the room and not form part of the quorum. It would be extremely difficult to carry out the work of the new agency if board members had to keep declaring an interest in the very speciality on which they are there to advise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Government to go further than they have gone in their advertisement and make explicit the requirement that applicants should not be direct beneficiaries of those with a vested interest in the deliberations of that committee. If that meant that the appointments had to be made more substantial, and therefore better remunerated, it would be a small price to pay. It would not make a great deal of difference to the total budget for the agency if one paid them £8,000 or £80,000 a year, although I am not suggesting that we should opt for the higher figure. The agency needs people who have expertise and probity, but who are seen to be free from any direct links with the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health will respond to the debate, but I should like to ask how far the hon. Gentleman—and, indeed, the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman)—wish to go? Would they include the candidate's spouse? On some scientific advisory committees, people have been attacked for the jobs done by their spouses. The hon. Gentleman is putting forward an extreme view, and I wonder how far he would go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have no problem with the spouse working in the industry. However, I should have a problem if substantial investments were held in the spouse's name for the sole purpose of ensuring that there was no direct link with the individual. There are good precedents for setting up such a system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I need to point out the inconsistencies in the earlier speech of the hon. Member for Meriden because they were well illustrated by the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble). If we are to establish an agency
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
that has the trust of the people, we need to go further than the Bill currently does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate, and I have now had time to scan the information that the Government have placed in the Committee Room relating to the appointment of the chair, deputy chair and agency members. I am grateful to the Government for providing that information. It was only a brief scan, and it is a complicated document, but I should like to ask the Minister about one or two points in the document in the hope that she will be able to give the Committee further clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, what balance, in terms of the experience of members, does the Minister envisage that there will be? Paragraph 15 says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Candidates for these positions will certainly need track records demonstrating substantial achievement at a senior level".</p></blockquote>
I would have thought that every person appointed to the agency would come into that category. I hope that we shall not have too many ordinary lay people on the Food Standards Agency, who might not be able to deal with the complex issues involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the substantial part on the amendments, contained in paragraphs 20 to 23, and I want to pick up on some inconsistencies in the document. Paragraph 20 says that members will be expected to have
	<br><blockquote><p>"the ability to serve without any actual or perceived significant conflict of interest".</p></blockquote>
I should like to know in more detail what that means because it seems to me that the new principles should fundamentally require a declaration of interest, so that the public and everyone else involved understands what prejudices members might have. However, that should not necessarily debar them from being members of the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 23—the key paragraph—says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Chair, Deputy Chair and Members will be required to declare all their personal or business interests".</p></blockquote>
That worries me because if they have to declare all their business interests, presumably going back to the year dot, we could eliminate many people who have the relevant experience, Indeed, some of the Minister's right hon. and hon. Friends could be debarred because they might have holdings in blind trusts, of which they were not even aware, or they might have shareholdings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the position on shareholdings, foreign holdings and a spouse's holdings? Paragraph 23 says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"any current or past connection of the applicant or his or her partner should be disclosed in the application".</p></blockquote>
Will the applicant's spouse have to make the same declaration as the applicant? Those important issues need to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like some advice from the Minister on the way in which members will be selected because paragraph 34 says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"You may expect to receive acknowledgement by 14 August. Interviews will take place with an interdepartmental panel of officials".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0493">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
That raises the issue of who makes the appointment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. No, it does not. The amendments relate specifically to financial matters, to which the hon. Gentleman must confine himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr. Gale. I was about to come back into order. The officials who scrutinise such financial information may or may not have prejudices, but they may start to select according to those prejudices. In any selection procedure, there is a danger that some people will be selected out before their application has been considered. The Minister must assure the Committee that the interdepartmental panel of officials will be truly unbiased and will have a completely open mind within the context of what is laid down in the Bill. The issue of financial interests is important, but I hope that the frame of mind will not be so narrow that people who are thoroughly suitable and qualified to serve as members of the board are excluded. In the House of Lords, for example, those who are active in business, the academic world or other spheres may not be such regular attenders as other noble Lords, but when they do attend they make a worthwhile contribution. The fact that some members of the board may not be able to attend every meeting on every day should not automatically preclude their membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will provide clarification on those points, and I look forward to her comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Public Health (Ms Tessa Jowell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important debate in terms of fleshing out the way in which the agency will operate in practice. We have always made it clear that the agency would be free of conflicts of interest and that it would operate in an open and transparent way. That is why it is essential to know and consider the interests of potential appointees or those who sit on the board of the agency. That will ensure, in their interests and the interests of the agency, that transparency prevails.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend made it clear when we appeared before the Select Committee that having an interest is not a bar to sitting on the board and being accepted as a member of the board. There is all the difference in the world between having an interest and not declaring it, and having an interest and declaring it. That is why the Nolan-Peach appointments procedure makes clear provision for declaration of interests and judgment on how that declaration is handled. The scale of the interest may lead the board to conclude that appointment would be inappropriate. Alternatively, the declaration and public knowledge of the interest might resolve what would otherwise be a potential conflict, or the interest might be such that the individual, while appointed to the board, would withdraw from discussions on matters that bring the interest into sharp relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the mechanism for establishing interest as one of the key means of underpinning the transparency and, ultimately, the integrity of the agency is clearly set out. It is important that everyone understands that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
It is in the interests of the agency and of the people who offer to become members of the board that the rules and procedures, and the way in which potential conflicts of interest are handled, are clear. Many of the people who apply to become members of the board will, I suspect, lead private lives. The declaration of interest, for example, will ensure that for such people there is a major step between being a private citizen and a public office holder.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister raises an important issue. People outside the House who are considering whether to apply to become a member of the agency will consider that matter carefully. Will the chairman have the discretion to establish what members with interests can speak on, or will there be a clearly defined set of standing orders, which would allow absolute decisions to be taken in certain circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Schedule 1, which we shall discuss later, states that the agency will develop its rules of procedure. The chairman will be in a position to exercise discretion. When discretion is exercised, it is important that that involves information that makes transparent any potential conflict. That essential issue lies at the heart of our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains provisions about the registering of interests. A key way to make sure that the agency is trusted is to ensure that the procedures work and are seen to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I understood the hon. Member for Meriden correctly, the intention behind amendment No. 10 is to remove not the consideration of interest but the associated legal duty. Her point was that to infer that there is a financial interest may, in some way, preclude a potential applicant from consideration. If that is her concern, I assure her that that is not the case. She shakes her head, so perhaps that is not her concern. There is no question about the fact that, other things being considered, the existence of a financial interest is a bar to an individual's appointment to the board of the Food Standards Agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister might want to reaffirm, or to think again about, what she just said. She said that, other things being considered, a financial interest would be a bar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I said that it would not—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that it would not be a bar to appointment to the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 11 would require the agency to maintain and publish an annual register. The amendment's main aim is already provided for in schedule 1, paragraph 9. We are prepared to give further consideration to the way in which the register will be compiled and maintained and to the importance of its being publicly available, and may introduce an amendment at a further stage in our considerations.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) asked about the quorum provided for in schedule 1. It will be for the agency to determine its rules of procedure and to set the attendance that will constitute a quorum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cotswold and one of his hon. Friends also asked about regularity of attendance. Public bodies will set the generally expected attendance threshold. The implication of his question is that, in order to broaden the pool of expertise on which we can draw, we are inviting to our advisory committees people who live in America and European countries, which may affect the regularity and frequency of attendance. That must be understood from the outset; it must not transpire in the course of repeated absence and failure to attend meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those observations, which I hope have also dealt with the converse point that the Liberal Democrats have made in tabling amendment No. 75, and subject to our willingness to introduce a further amendment to tackle the issues raised in amendment No. 11 on the declaration of interests, we shall not accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are pleased to hear that the Minister is prepared to consider reviewing the clause, and we look forward to the amendments that will deal with the register of interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we are talking past each other on amendment No. 10. We have reached a strong basis of agreement. If we have understood correctly, the Government do not want to debar people who have financial interests from applying and being appointed. One of the problems is the high degree of subjectivity about what constitutes a conflict of interest. It is perfectly possible for an applicant or a member of the agency not to perceive a conflict of interest, especially after declaring an interest in a register. However, paragraph 20 of the job description specifies
	<br><blockquote><p>"the ability to serve without any actual or perceived significant conflict of interest".</p></blockquote>
Much of the problem lies in the question of perceived interest. Amending that point might clear up any misunderstanding among potential applicants who might perceive themselves to be debarred because of a perceived conflict of interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having heard the Minister's assurances, I am much happier about amendment No. 11, but I remain unhappy about amendment No. 75 for two reasons. The agency's credibility will depend on its perceived independence. In the eyes of the public, it is not acceptable for most of the agency's membership to comprise people with direct, and possibly current, interests in the very business that the agency has been established to regulate. Let us suppose that someone with expertise in food production, food distribution or growing food must discuss a matter such as GM crops. If all members have business interests that are involved in, interested in or sponsor manufacturing processes, there may be no one available at the agency with whom to have meaningful discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For good political reasons and to help the public accept the agency, I would like to press amendment No. 75. For practical reasons I do not think that it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
satisfactory for the agency to have the power to set its own quorum. It could set it at a ridiculous level. Surely Ministers have to take that fact on board and be slightly more specific about it. I would like to move amendment No. 75 formally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall invite the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) to move amendment No. 75 formally when we reach it on the selection list.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 78, in page 2, line 10, leave out 'and' and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(b) ensure that the majority of members of the Agency have a public interest background; and'.</p></blockquote>
I shall be brief, given that a lot of the issues that relate to the amendment have already been well aired. I seek to reinstate a commitment previously made by the Government. The overriding function of the agency is the protection of public health and the consumer interest in relation to food. The composition of the agency will be crucial to its success, and it is important that its members are appointed openly on merit and according to the Peach-Nolan rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper specifies that a majority of members should
	<br><blockquote><p>"come from a wider public interest background without any specific affiliation."</p></blockquote>
However, that commitment is not explicit in the Bill, and we merely seek to reinstate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The balance must be right. There must be areas of expertise and interest, but there must also be a majority free from specific affiliations. I do not want to ensure that there are food faddists or representatives from minority consumer organisations in the agency. I simply want to ensure that the majority of its representatives are bona fide and demonstrable representatives of the public interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of the points raised by the amendment have been dealt with in our extensive debates. Although we have not specifically included in the Bill the intention that the hon. Gentleman wants, it is clearly stated in all the associated literature, including the information for potential applicants. To have included it would have been restrictive and would have required a definition of public interest that in turn could have restricted the range of applicants from which the agency was able to choose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, although we accept the spirit of the amendment, I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that we should not amend the Bill in that overly restrictive way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Maclean 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Penrith and The Border)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I offer my profuse apologies to you, Mr. Gale, and to the Committee for moving an amendment earlier and not being present to hear the Minister's reply.

following his sad death I have been inundated with calls from the media to which I felt compelled to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in the amendment because the Minister says that she accepts its spirit. I would like to know what it means. In moving it, the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. George) left me with no certainty as to what public interest backgrounds are. He implied that the only genuine public interest background would be a bona fide consumers association—or bona fide consumers. He said that it was not—did not include faddists or some of the smaller consumers associations. I am not sure where that leaves them. Presumably, the hon. Gentleman concludes that someone who is a member of the British Medical Association would be biased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One could conclude that members of the BMA or medical practitioners were totally biased. If a doctor were in private practice, one could say that he had a vested interest in the treatment of those with illnesses or food poisoning. One could say that the researchers working in the Public Health Laboratory Service were not absolutely neutral; they may say that they are independent, but they would have a vested interest in continuing with their research. Every research organisation in the world has an interest in continuing research. When they come to a conclusion on Government-commissioned research, the only solution would lie in further research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not particular to one organisation; it is an inevitable facet of research. The Government could go to any university or food science research body, even to the Consumers Association, and find people with vested interests. It may not be the same as a financial interest, which one might find if the managing director of United Biscuits was asked to serve on the agency. Financial interests may be obvious in the commercial world, but many people have many opinions on food, and many people are involved in research, and have all already ploughed their furrow with a particular view and will continue to publish scientific research with their own line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be absolutely impossible to find someone with a genuine public interest background who does not have an opinion, who is not biased and who can be totally objective. I am sure that the Minister will take the spirit of that on board; we would all take it on board. However, I should like the hon. Member for St. Ives to give more examples of where one might find these magic people—people who have ability, knowledge and practical experience but who are not biased, have no vested interest resulting from their background, commercial activity or research, or who have not already expressed their views in the press for or against the Bill or against the Government's food policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his answer. The purpose of the amendment was to tease out why it was that the Government made
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
explicit their intention to have a majority of people representing the public interest, yet did not include that in the Bill. I was minded to withdraw the amendment, but the rather convoluted arguments of the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border tempted me to reverse that decision. However, I accept that the Government intend to keep to the spirit of what was originally intended in the White Paper, and it is now on record. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>APPOINTMENT OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTORS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 2, line 20, leave out 'appropriate authorities acting jointly' and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'Secretary of State after public advertisement'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 13, in page 2, line 21, leave out from 'Agency' to end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under amendment No. 12, the lines of responsibility for the agency's chief executive would be made clear. Obviously, the chief executive will have an important, full-time role in the day-to-day running of the agency. We know from other public bodies that the relationship between the chairman and the chief executive depends heavily on the competence of the chief executive in ensuring the efficient and effective running of the public body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The line of responsibility would be clearer if the chief executive were answerable to the Secretary of State, rather than the appropriate authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is always difficult to answer to more than one boss. If different bosses have competing interests and responsibilities,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
people can be pulled in multiple directions. That is why the Secretary of State should be responsible for the chief executive's appointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to clarify the approval process which involves a range of separate authorities. Although, in theory, such approval is desirable, it can result in an endless round of trying to find someone who pleases all the authorities. The authorities might feel strongly about the importance of their representation in such matters. That might lead to conflicts between them, whereas appointment by the Secretary of State constitutes a clear-cut line of responsibility understood by everyone, including the person fortunate enough to be appointed. Such a procedure, which is clear in the public eye, would simplify the process, which is complicated unnecessarily because several authorities have a finger in the pie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 3 deals with the agency's chief executive and directors. On amendment No. 12, unlike in discussion of the agency's chair and deputy chair, there is no advertisement to discuss. However, it has always been our intention to advertise the posts publicly. Indeed, the rules of the civil service commissioners require such senior posts in the civil service to be advertised. There is no argument about that. I can give no date, but an advertisement will appear shortly. Therefore, a statutory requirement to advertise the posts is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice), rather than the hon. Member for Meriden, should be aware that the problem with amendment No. 13 is the need to achieve agreement on the appointments. This is a very joined-up Government, but we cannot go off on our own; we must get the agreement of our colleagues, which sometimes makes the process slower. However, getting such an agreement means that we will get a better decision and everyone will be satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the setting up of the agency and the appointment of the first chief executive. In the advertisement, different closing dates are given for applying for the posts of chair and deputy chair and for applying for other posts. That is because we want the chair and deputy chair to be involved in the selection of the first chief executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3(1) makes provision for the agency to appoint a chief executive. However, as the agency does not yet exist, that appointment will be slightly different. Nevertheless, ensuring that the Secretary of State, the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly agree the appointment of future chief executives selected by the agency makes for common sense and good government. The devolved authorities must be on board if the agency is to be a success. That is a bit of longstop, but I cannot see a problem with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As time passes, I do not doubt that Select Committees will want a role in the agency. That is not an invitation; I would not dream of prescribing what those Committees do. It is important that people should not be appointed behind closed doors. We do not want an agency which says, "This is the chief executive for this UK authority, like it or lump it. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
haven't had to see anyone or get agreement from other people."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not taking that approach. I, therefore, request the hon. Member for Meriden to withdraw her amendments. Amendment No. 12 is simply not needed. The appointment is for a senior position in the civil service and will follow the civil service commissioners' rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In future, other authorities must be involved in approving the agency's decision. However, after the appointment of the first chief executive has ended, the agency itself will conduct the search for future chief executives and will submit its decision for approval by the other authorities. I see nothing wrong in that, as it will lead to a much better agency and much better joined-up working all round.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I obviously have much less experience than other Front-Bench spokesmen on the Committee. Coming from the business world, it is sometimes quite hard to understand why Government decision-making is so tortuous. However, I am prepared to accept the explanation of colleagues who have far more experience of such matters than me. Given the Minister's clarification of how the provision will work and how the agency will be perceived in the public eye in relation to future appointments, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister of State implied in his response to my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden, to a certain extent we are back on territory that we covered this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment No. 14—to which amendments Nos. 15 and 16 are purely consequential—is to provide the opportunity to debate the concept of having individual directors for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but not, it appears, for England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We obviously welcome the appointment of a chief executive for the agency. It is difficult to envisage how the agency would operate without one. However, we must ask whether the appointment of regional directors will lead to a more effective agency—as, no doubt, the Government would contend—or to more bureaucracy, confusion and the development of separate policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, the Minister said, repeatedly and rightly, that the agency will be a UK-wide body. Therefore, we must ask whether agency's efficiency will be improved by the development of a system of regional directors and the regional advisory committees that we will discuss later. I hope that offence will not be taken at my using the word "regional", and that it will not be said that Scotland is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
not a region and so on. It is an easy word to use when describing various parts of the United Kingdom. We contend that a system of regional directors will cause more difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
2.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is clearly the potential for a bureaucratic organisation to be set up. I hope that that will not happen, but we should be wary about putting bits into the Bill that could increase bureaucracy rather than reduce it. I question the logic of having separate directors. There is also the potential for different policies to be developed in various parts of the United Kingdom and for each director to become a policy maker in his or her fiefdom. Food safety policy in the United Kingdom would be undermined and become less credible if such a pick-and-mix method was adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are intent on such a system, it must be asked why there is not to be a director for England. If there are to be chief executives and directors for the other three parts of the United Kingdom, it would be wholly inconsistent for England not to have the same. If such a structure were necessary, clearly England should be part of it. However, that aspect is secondary to my argument, which is that there should not be regional directors at all, but a flatter hierarchial structure running from the chief executive down to those who are closer to the operational level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more tiers of management and directorship that are installed in the structure, the more serious the risk of the agency becoming more of a talking shop. I know what the Minister will say, but it is not clear where the directors will come from; are they to be directors in the term that my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden would understand and be from the private sector, that is board members with a responsibility for the regions, or will they be appointed directors junior to the chief executive, as happens sometimes in public authorities? The title "director" is being used in a way that I do not like, because it does not truly represent what is suggested in the Bill. The Minister of State nods, so I presume that they will be appointed along the lines of my latter suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's acknowledgment, but that is not made clear in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will really be in charge? With whom will the final authority lie? As I have established, the directors will be junior to the chief executive and it could be argued that the final authority lies with the chief executive and, thus, to the board. If so, what will be the role of the regional directors who, to do their job, will have inevitably to respond to the demands of different situations in certain parts of the United Kingdom for which they are responsible? There is a real concern that that will lead to confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said this morning that he could imagine differences arising in various parts of the United Kingdom. Such a situation will be extremely
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
confusing. How can we have a different food policy in Wales from that in England? My hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) who lives 50 yd from the Welsh border will find such a system even more confusing because, if he turns out of his drive one way and goes to a shop, he could be faced with different regulations from those that he would meet if he had turned the other way. That does not make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the same applies to my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border. Either one has a UK-wide agency with a consistent food policy, or one devolves powers. I would not favour devolving powers. The Minister said this morning that the legislation makes it clear that the Scottish Parliament could take the matter on board. That is fine, but given that, as the Minister also said, they have taken the opposite decision, it would be daft to muddy the waters by building regionality into a system that should be one thing or the other. The way in which the provision structures the directors makes no sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the confusion that will arise from the development of different policies in a UK-wide agency. Amendment No. 14, along with amendments Nos. 15 and 16, would delete all reference to individual directors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, because I too feel that there is a danger of great confusion and muddle. We shall have a chief executive and deputy chief executive who, as I understand it, will be responsible for the entire United Kingdom. Individual directors will be appointed with responsibility for England, Wales and Scotland, and they will be answerable to the chief executive for the whole United Kingdom. Who will run England? The answer is that the chief executive for the whole United Kingdom will be in charge of the agency in respect of its English functions. For practical purposes, perhaps he will delegate that responsibility to the deputy chief executive, but the Bill does not make that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In England, there may be the perception that they are getting the thin end of the wedge. However, given particular Scottish sensitivities, there may also be a perception in Scotland that the UK chief executive, who also runs England, is in some way infinitely superior to directors in Scotland. Although we may protest that the United Kingdom Government's job is to run England, there is often the perception in Scotland that the United Kingdom Parliament is interested only in English matters. The Government may be inadvertently adding to that perception by not designating a separate director for England of equal rank to those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and by appointing a chief executive in a federal capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the chief executive with responsibility for the entire United Kingdom agency is also de facto the English chief executive, that may be another source of grievance for the Scots and the Welsh. They may say, "Typical! Situation normal. We have devolution and are supposed to be doing our own thing, but the chief executive to whom we answer is of course the bloke— or lady—who runs England and English matters."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, I would not go down the route of having separate directors for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, if that is what the Government want, there should be a specific director for England who is of a rank and status equal to the director for Scotland, and who is the driving executive behind all enforcement action in England. That would be logical and sensible, would take account of Scottish sensitivities, and would-not-undermine the purpose of devolving power to Scotland. In his UK federal capacity, the main chief executive would pull together all the directors, ensuring the co-ordination and delivery of service throughout the United Kingdom.

I am pleased to support the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being slightly late. I was attending business questions, where I raised a matter—the advice that I would like the Government to give to my constituents—that is pertinent to the clause and the amendments, which I support. Within a month, it is likely that the Welsh Assembly will have reported and voted on lifting the famous beef-on-the-bone ban. The Minister may laugh, but every candidate bar one made clear his or her views on lifting the ban. The majority of candidates stated in their manifestos that, if elected to the welsh Assembly, they would vote to lift the ban at the first opportunity. It was a policy of three of the parties, and the Labour party is in a minority there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, I live right on the Welsh border. What would be the position for my constituents if they drove over the border after the ban had been lifted in Wales, bought material that would, by then, be quite legal there, and brought it back to England? What would be the position for butchers in towns near the border who went to Wales, bought beef on the bone and tried to sell it in England? The position is not clear at present; this is still a hypothetical question because the Assembly has not voted on the matter, but such occurrences are likely to crop up soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have created an anomaly in that their commitment to devolution runs headlong into their commitment to set national standards for food safety. I do not see how they can square that circle. Let us stay with the Welsh example. Would the Welsh director be beholden to the interests represented by the people in the Welsh Assembly, or would his remit be to try to follow through the stated aims of the agency as set out in clause 1? Who is to decide what his priority would be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can find nothing in the Bill or the explanatory notes—or in the document on the appointment of members that we received during the lunch break—to explain how such decisions will be reached. Would a director from Wales be overruled by a majority vote in the agency? Would the Chairman have the power to overrule all other 11 members? They might all be Celts. We might find that all the best food hygienists come from the Celtic parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
I have yet to find a document published by the Government that sets out how those decisions will be reached. It is clear that there will be a muddle. Certain directors will be appointed solely on a geographical basis, and I presume that they will be left to plough their own furrow. That cannot lead to nationwide standards for food safety. It is bound to lead to irregularities, such as the case of beef on the bone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to establish an agency with integrity and independence that will be respected throughout the United Kingdom, we do not need geographical uncertainties thrown into the equation. We do not need geographically appointed directors. Furthermore—I repeat the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border—we do not need to irritate the English any further. Why are the English being left out of the proposals? I shall leave that issue to one side. I am interested in establishing an agency that has integrity and commands respect throughout the country, to set uniform standards. I therefore support amendments Nos. 14 and 15.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be as brief in my response as I was on the previous group of amendments, but I may not succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hypothetical issue raised by the hon. Member for North Shropshire, there is an amendment somewhere on the amendment paper designed to do nothing more than provide a debate on beef on the bone. I do not, therefore, intend to have one now, as it is clear that we shall have that opportunity in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not one of our amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is most certainly such an amendment, and I can assure the hon. Gentleman that it was not tabled by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Assembly will make up its own mind, based on scientific and medical evidence. It will listen to the advice of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, and consider what the chief medical officer, Department of Health, has to say. If Welsh beef farmers want to export beef, under any circumstances, the Welsh Assembly will not jump the gun, or turn over medical and scientific evidence. If that were to happen, it is as sure as night follows day that the European Union would take a different view of Welsh beef from that of English and Scottish beef. Any decision must, therefore, be based firmly on scientific and medical evidence and I know that the Welsh Assembly is taking that on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border referred to the deputy chief executive. We must discuss the Bill as it is drafted and not as people believe it is drafted. Clause 2 refers to the board—I shall not call it the board of directors because that would be confusing—which is the agency, the commission or the chief decision makers. It is clear from the job description that the chief public face of the agency is not the chief executive but the chair of the agency. The main interface with the public will be the chair of the agency, not the chief executive. We can put the agency on one side and deal with clause 3, which refers to the operational directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
The joint food safety and standards group was set up in September 1997 and its chief public face is my right hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health and me; the chief operating officer is the chief executive, who runs the staff. That is the distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
2.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distinction will continue because the quasi-ministerial powers will go to the board or commission—clause 2 refers to the agency, which can be confusing. The chief operating officer will be the chief executive—there are no deputies—but there will be directors for the territories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it is not prescribed, the Food Standards Agency will probably set up an office in the territories of the United Kingdom—Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. If the amendments were accepted, there would be enormous pressure for separate agencies in those territorial areas because the link would have been broken. Food safety is a matter for the devolved assemblies, but we are setting up a United Kingdom authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any legislation, whether statutory instruments or primary legislation, will be introduced in Westminster by Act of Parliament, but the devolved assemblies will have to do likewise in the Scottish Parliament and by secondary legislation in the Welsh Assembly. It is not a question of setting up a UK-wide agency, with legislative powers being retained here. Power has been devolved and to have operational directors in the territories with a link to the legislative bodies is crucial because the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament will deal with legislation, as shall we at Westminster. It could be argued that Westminster will legislate de facto for England on matters that are devolved to the regional assemblies, which will make their legislative arrangements under the two Acts of Parliament implemented last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a UK agency and the devolved parliamentary assemblies have agreed that that is the best way, but procedures must be in place to ensure that the system works properly and to avoid creating conditions that would invite those authorities to set up their own agencies outwith the UK agency. We want the system to gel together and not break apart. To knock out the directors of the agencies would go to the heart of our arrangements for devolution. There is no English devolved Parliament, although I have said in shorthand that we would legislate for England. There is no English appointment in the sense of that for the devolved authorities, which is why there is no director listed for England. For practical purposes, that would be the chief executive. I have not taken advice, but that is the common sense arrangement. Alternatively, the chief executive might choose to delegate his or her authority. It is not a matter to be prescribed in legislation. Most of the full-time professional staff of the agency are already doing the work, as members of the joint food safety and standards group. They will transfer voluntarily to the agency—we are not forcing them—and there will also be additional staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
If we are to make it work, the board and the officers—including the chief executive and the directors—must have an understanding of what happens on the ground in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. That is why the Bill must make provision for the appointment of directors for those areas at an operational level. It is expected, not prescribed, that the agency will have small offices. In England, it may decide to have sub-regional or English regional offices, but that will be a matter for the agency. The agency will have staff of quality and integrity who should be left to get on with the job. Attempts by the Government to prescribe in such detail would deter good candidates from applying, as the scope and powers of the job would be limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have explained the need for a link with full-time qualified staff at an operational level, and the need for legislation, from time to time, on food safety. Such legislation will usually be by statutory instrument, as primary legislation is rarely required. Indeed, this is only the second Bill that I have dealt with in two years, and the first was taken off the shelf after being left there by the previous Government for four years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I remember the Plant Varieties Bill well. As the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly will deal with the matter, it is important that there is a link with the agency at the operational level. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for attempting to justify the clause, and for giving his reasons for declining to accept the amendment. Having jousted with him for the two years to which he referred, I have no doubt that he is looking forward to the next reshuffle, when he may be moved on to greater things. If that happens, so be it. For his sake, I hope that it does happen, as the convoluted form of semi-devolution in this Bill will create huge problems and confusion. If he is not moved on, I fear that the job of sorting the mess out will land on his desk in the next couple of years. We are sowing the seeds of immense discontent and confusion, not to mention extra bureaucracy, in terms of developing other policies. The Minister said that there was no devolvement to an English Parliament, and he is right. However, he then implied that the Welsh Assembly or the Scottish Parliament could conceivably pass legislation, whether primary or secondary, on food policy. That takes us further into confusion. Will there be a UK-wide agency, which has been the gist of the Minister's remarks all day, or will there be a wholly devolved policy? The Assembly and the Parliament have voted not to take such responsibility—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The analogy of statutory instruments is right, and if I am to be contradicted, so be it. Hardly a day goes by on which I do not sign a statutory instrument that has to be whipped around Whitehall and signed by a Minister in the Scottish Office or Welsh Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
In future, that will not happen—my officials indicate that I am correct to say that. Such statutory instruments will be dealt with by the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Executive, and the relevant need will no longer remain. The proposal is to legislate not against the norm but in tandem, because the relevant matter is devolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that those statutory instruments might not be pushed through. The implication of the Minister's comments is that the Welsh Assembly or the Scottish Parliament might decide not to push through the statutory instruments that he had signed on behalf of England. We could end up having policies that differed in detail in different parts of the United Kingdom, which would undermine the concept of a UK-wide agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall return to this issue later. It goes to the heart of the matter—it involves the operation of the system and the service that is delivered to the consumer. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 2, line 34, leave out 'a' and insert 'an independent'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 18, in page 2, line 34, after 'activities', insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>', organisation, structure (including numbers of staff), accounts'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 19, in page 2, line 37, leave out from 'Parliament' to end of line 38.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment involves the annual report of the new Food Standards Agency. In preparation for this debate, I examined several comparable organisations that produce an annual report so that we might learn from the practice in other areas. As we said earlier, the agency has the problem that it is, in one sense, a hybrid—it falls somewhere between a quango and a non-statutory body. It may be similar to the Office for Standards in Education. I shall use various examples to illustrate the sort of annual report that the agency might produce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All three amendments clarify what would be expected of the agency. Amendment No. 17 is, in many ways, the most important amendment because it stresses the report's independence. We want to add the phrase, "an independent" to the Bill because we are concerned that the agency should be seen to be independent and at arm's length from government. One of the principle reasons for setting up the agency is to make it clear to the public and to consumers that the agency is, as far as possible, free from governmental intervention. We therefore think that it is important to stress the report's independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The examples that I chose also involve the report's content. We want the Bill to state that the report
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
should give information about the organisation, structure and accounts of the agency, and its number of staff. That differs from the report that Ofsted is required to issue under the School Inspections Act 1996. That Act places few conditions on the annual report's contents. It simply states:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Chief Inspector … shall make an annual report to the Secretary of State, who shall lay a copy of it before each House of Parliament".</p></blockquote>
That contrasts with the more detailed requirements that the Agricultural Marketing Act 1983 places on the quango Food From Britain. That Act states that the annual report should contain "proper accounting records", and that those accounts should
	<br><blockquote><p>"give a true and fair view of the state of Food from Britain's affairs at the end of the financial year".</p></blockquote>
The Act goes on to define precisely the terms under which such information should be given to Ministers, and it contains much more detail than is currently considered necessary in the Bill. However, the annual report of the Food Standards Agency should contain more detail than is required by the School Inspections Act 1996. The range of the agency's activities means that it will be possible for it to charge people if they want a service. That is very different from what the chief inspector of schools can do. As money might change hands, it is important that the report contains a proper record of the new agency's financial affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third of our amendments draws attention to the way in which the report is subsequently handled. The Bill provides for it to be laid before the Parliaments and Assemblies of the devolved United Kingdom. Our attempt to delete that requirement derives from our desire to place more emphasis on the role of the UK Parliament in scrutinising the agency's work, as accounted for in its annual report. Parliament could play a more proactive role. It has the right to scrutinise the report and we could include an obligation for it to approve the FSA's business plan. The Food from Britain council is required to produce its business plan as a public document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By increasing Parliament's responsibility, we could force a debate on the policy and strategy of the FSA. As part of open government, we have the opportunity to create an agency that is more transparent than any other agency. The public and the consumer would be able to see democratically elected Members of this House engage with a body that has been set up to protect the public interest and to promote food safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not unreasonable to envisage a role for Parliament in monitoring more closely the results of the FSA's actions. My hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said on Second Reading that we would table a new clause to introduce a performance evaluation of the agency. The annual report would be a good place to set out how it is performing. It would allow everyone to see whether it is a success or failure. However, it is important to decide how success would be measured. Let us consider the bald statistics of the number of food poisoning cases. If we regard a decrease in those statistics as a success, would an increase be regarded as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
a failure? It is clear that that would be too crude a measure of performance. It is important to discuss how we are to measure the effectiveness of the agency and for Parliament to engage in the debate on what the indicators of success should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We certainly welcome the Minister's suggestion that the agency will work out national multi-disciplinary indicators with local authorities. The Government have given some idea of how they will attempt to assess whether the agency is succeeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure that the annual report makes a valuable contribution to the scrutiny of the agency. By bringing the work of the agency into the public eye, we will have a clear view of whether headway is being made on the improvement of public safety. It is not unreasonable for the Bill to be more specific on what the report should contain. Streamlining scrutiny of the agency's work through the UK Parliament will enable a more concentrated and specific analysis of whether the agency's chosen strategies are having the desired impact. For those reasons, I ask the Committee to support all three amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to pursue a little further a number of the excellent points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden. Although I am debarred from attending it, I remain a member of the Public Accounts Committee. In that capacity, during the past two years I have had to read a huge number of annual reports, the contents of which differ enormously. Given the tenor of the debate on the Food Standards Agency, it will be in the agency's interests to try to produce an annual report that is as open and complete as possible. I would like to think that the report will contain much of the information that a normal Companies Act report contains, albeit in a form adapted to a non-departmental public body, if that is what the agency will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall run through one or two areas that the report should cover, and probe the Minister on those that it will. It should contain detailed financial information, including audited accounts, which, presumably, under departmental guidelines, will be conducted on a resource accounting basis. That would make the accounting system much more transparent. The report will have to detail the use of all the agency's assets, and its contingency liabilities. Will it also detail the interests, remuneration, emoluments and pension structure of all chairmen and members? Will it give similar details on staff numbers and salary costs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also worried that certain pressure groups and interest groups will request a huge number of commissions. Will the report include information, albeit in summary form, on requested commissions, the organisations that requested them and the cost recovered by the agency?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be interesting to know, as other reports make clear, the number of communications that the agency undertakes with Members of Parliament and the public each year, what references are made to the ombudsman and the results of any subsequent action. It would be essential to know what enforcement action
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
the agency had undertaken, including details on legal actions and successful prosecutions. Again, they could be given in summary form. It would also be interesting to know whether legal actions were taken against the agency and, if successful, what action the agency took to remedy judgments obtained thereby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On devolution, on which we had a long debate, it would be interesting to know whether the report will contain separate sections relating to the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, the Northern Ireland Assembly and, indeed, the English Parliament. If each is to have separate responsibilities, the report should give some information on individual policies in each area of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of separate sections, it would be interesting to know how non-departmental public bodies such as the Meat Hygiene Service and the standards and safety committees will be dealt with. Will they be subsumed in the main report, or dealt with in separate sections?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Desmond Turner 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brighton, Kemptown)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us the number of pages that the report should contain? It might also be useful to know which typeface he would prefer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a sensible question. I have read an enormous number of such reports. There is usually an executive summary for the idle at the beginning followed by a more detailed report for those who want to probe the facts and figures and the actions of an organisation. Having a well-structured annual report has led to far better inquiries and hearings by the Public Accounts Committee. Indeed, once one gets used to reading them, it is surprising how quickly one can assimilate knowledge from even fairly long annual reports, which can run to 100 pages. I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify the matter, because I believe that the more open the report, the more confidence the public will have in the agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the comments of my hon. Friends. We are setting up a new agency that will have power to raise revenue. It is advertised as having a turnover of £125 million and 500 staff, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold mentioned, it will take on much more than that. As the Bill now stands, the agency will take on the work of the Meat Hygiene Service. I shall not be tempted to speak too much about the MHS, Mr. Gale, because I am sure that we shall debate it at length later. However, I remind the Committee that it has a turnover of £53 million and, according to its smart, glossy report, £33 million of that is needed to pay its 1,384 employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency must be accountable to Parliament. It will be much bigger than advertised if it takes on the important powers of the MHS. It will have huge powers; critically, it will have huge fund-raising powers. The MHS can expand its own activities and therefore expand the resources—in other words, taxation—that it can demand from what it would call its customers, although those who know it might use a ruder word. That is a good reason for the agency
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
to be subject to stronger parliamentary accountability than the MHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The MHS is already causing considerable damage to large parts of the industry by imposing huge costs. In one case, costs of £300 a year have increased to £17,000 a year. That is because Parliament is not scrutinising the organisation adequately. It has a glossy and cleverly written report, all about performance targets, but it does not say what is happening to the numerous businesses that it is driving into bankruptcy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need much tighter parliamentary scrutiny for the Food Standards Agency. The current line is quite inadequate. Clause 4(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Agency shall prepare a report on its activities and performance during each financial year."</p></blockquote>
The explanatory notes contain only three lines on the subject:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Agency will be required to lay an annual report on its activities and performance before Parliament and before the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly. It may also make other reports to them."</p></blockquote>
That is not good enough. We have to decide here and now the criteria of those reports, their depth, who should draw them up, who should vet them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 19—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Does the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) want to intervene? I could not quite hear his chunterings from the back row of the Government Benches. I am trying to make a serious point. We are about to set up an agency with a substantial budget of public money. We shall see in later clauses that it will have the most extraordinary power to influence the lives, businesses and affairs of a large number of people. It will take on another agency, which is not properly controlled by Parliament. It is strange that the hon. Member for Norwich, North should find it a laughing matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I simply suggest that the clause should be amended on report to include clear criteria on who should run the agency, how it should report its business, how it should manage its staff, who should set the budget and how the budget should be controlled. Moreover, no mechanism seems to have been provided for the report to be audited. Parliament should audit the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This modest—in some ways, almost too modest— amendment to provide that organisation, structure and accounts should be reported on independently is sensible. The Food and Drink Federation strongly endorse, the proposal that the agency should have a clear business plan, which should include policy and strategy statements. We are not proposing anything out of the ordinary. Ultimately, Parliament should preside, decide what is wanted from the agency and report back. An auditing mechanism must be provided, because the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Agency shall prepare a report"</p></blockquote>
is quite inadequate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The purpose of the amendments is to probe the arrangements for accountability, transparency and monitoring the agency's performance. However, the Opposition are setting about the task in a way that is overly prescriptive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The annual report will be the agency's report, and it is not for Ministers to prescribe what the report should include. It is for the agency to prepare the report, which will be presented to Parliament. It will then be for Parliament to determine whether it is satisfied with the information submitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency will be a non-ministerial department, which means that it will have its own vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been absolutely clear. The agency will not be a non-departmental public body. It will be a non-ministerial department, and as such will have its own vote. Because the issue of monitoring performance was expressly raised in the Special Select Committee following consultation on the draft Bill, that was included in clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are enormously worried about the value that the British people receive for money invested, whether in Government Departments, bodies discharging responsibilities on the Government's behalf or independent or quasi-independent bodies such as the FSA. The FSA will therefore be accountable to the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee for how its money is spent. It will also have a public service agreement with the Treasury, which will be the condition on which money is provided. That is now the practice for every Department in Whitehall, and rightly so, because it creates a clear link between the outcomes achieved for investment in terms of staff and of other resources, and spending taxpayers' money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who will be the accounting officer? Will it be the agency's chief executive? If the agency is a non-ministerial department, it cannot be a Minister, which gives rise to questions about its funding. Now that the Government have accepted that the taxpayer will fund the agency, it needs not only an accounting officer but, as the Minister says, a vote. From which Department's vote will the agency's funds come? Which budget will be cut to find the money for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the chief executive will be the accounting officer. Secondly, there is no question of any existing budget being cut to fund the agency. As a non-ministerial departmental body, the agency will have its own vote. Its accounts will be produced in accordance with the requirements of resource accounting and budgeting that are specified for a non-ministerial departmental body.

The hon. Member for Meriden tried to establish an analogy with other bodies in order to understand the funding arrangements more clearly. Food from

	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
Britain—the organisation that the hon. Lady cited—is a non-departmental public body, so its funding statute has to specify in detail the form of accounts to be included in its report. However, I have made it clear that the agency is a non-ministerial departmental body, so it is not necessary to specify the form of accounts because that is covered under existing statute. With regard to amendment No. 19, we shall table an amendment to clause 39 to deal with the accounts of the devolved bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cotswold gave a litany of issues that he thought should be addressed in the annual report. I would expect the report to address precisely those matters. However, let me reiterate the central point. The report will be the agency's own, and it is not for Ministers to specify its contents. It will be for Parliament to decide whether or not it is satisfied with what the agency reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meriden raised an interesting issue about how the agency's success will be judged. Again, that matter was discussed by the Special Select Committee. One of the agency's early tasks will be to set its measures of performance, against which its success will be judged. For reasons that were discussed in that Committee, food poisoning is probably a bad example because the increased vigilance and coordination that we hope the agency will produce may result in more notifications of food-borne illness. That could be a mark of success, rather than one of a failure to curb the source of food-borne outbreaks. The agency will want to turn its attention to such matters very soon after its creation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Performance targets will be set, but the content of the report will not be dictated by Ministers. There are clear mechanisms by which the financial accounts of the agency will be established and against which the agency will be held responsible. The agency will also provide accounts to the devolved legislatures. As I have made clear, we intend to table a Government amendment to clause 39 to deal with the technical matters that will arise. We have had a useful probing debate, so I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened attentively to what the Minister said. I do not have as much experience as some of my hon. Friends on the role of the Public Accounts Committee in scrutinising annual reports, but the Minister said certain things that concern me. At one point, she used the phrase "independent or quasi-independent". One. of our most important problems is that the agency should not be seen as quasi-independent. One of the concepts of its establishment was to create clear independence in the public eye. I am left disquieted by the description that she gave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the uninitiated, and to me, the idea that the agency might set and evaluate its own performance targets seems to lack a degree of independence. For example, the FSA will take over the role of the MHS. There are performance targets in the MHS's annual report, and one of the problems of that organisation has been the way in which its independence has been
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
seen. Under the auspices of the FSA, it will be important that targets and their evaluation be seen to be measured in a most independent fashion. It would be difficult to understand how the idea of "own votes" has a sufficient degree of independence to inspire public confidence adequately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we suggested earlier, we shall table a new clause on the question of performance evaluation and we certainly want a more specific debate about that aspect of the agency's work. In view of that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 76, in page 2, line 39, leave out "may" and insert "shall".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to clarify the intended meaning of the clause. Does it mean that the agency may produce reports from time to time that will be laid before the specified bodies, or does it mean that the agency will produce reports that may from time to time be laid before those bodies? I read the clause to mean the latter. If the latter interpretation is correct, the Bill needs to be strengthened, especially in relation to public interest and to public trust in the agency. The public should have a right to require a justification for the agency, not publishing reports in addition to the annual reports. Any smack of secrecy will detract from public confidence in the agency. The purpose of establishing the agency in the first place is to overcome the problem of public perception about Ministers whose statements they do not entirely trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want an agency that is open and accountable and which has a presumption to publish, unless there is a good commercially confidential or other justifiable reason why it should not. The word "may" will provide the agency with a caveat. The purpose of the agency is to create public trust in food. The use of the word "may" undermines the Bill's purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 22(2)(c) is helpful in that it establishes a presumption to publish and to make information available. However, it would assist the Committee if the Minister could clarify the matter and reassure hon. Members that there will be a presumption to publish information that should be in the public domain, and which should be available to those Parliaments and to the Welsh Assembly. I commend amendment No. 76 to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, the amendment is both unnecessary and meaningless. The title of the clause is "Annual and other reports". It provides that an annual report will be compiled by the agency as an obligation and a duty, but that the agency will also have discretion to produce other reports that can be laid before Parliament. We cannot require the agency to provide further reports on unspecified topics in addition to the annual report, which will be the major account of the work undertaken, success achieved, and so forth. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the duty to present an annual report is clearly set out in the Bill, and that is linked to the opportunity for further reports to be presented, if and when necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the Minister's definition of a report? For example, could advice to Ministers constitute a report that could be published, or could the agency and the Ministry decide not to make public that advice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we get further into the Bill, the hon. Gentleman will see the grip on the process of accountability, disclosure and openness that the agency will have. Later, we shall debate the clauses that give the agency power to publish its advice to Ministers—an unprecedented power that is the essence of its openness and independence from any other pressure than that set out in the guiding principles and broad statement of objectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister answer clearly my first question? Does the clause mean that other reports may be produced or that other reports that are produced may be laid before those other bodies? That was not clear from the Minister's answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is essentially a matter for the agency. A range of other bodies, such as Select Committees and the Public Accounts Committee, may seek reports from the agency, and are free to do so. By the same token, the agency will lay its annual report before Parliament. If a matter is regarded as particularly important, and is the subject of a further report, that report may be laid before Parliament. The agency must exercise a degree of discretion in relation to such matters, but the clause provides that the agency will prepare an annual report, and that it will be laid before the UK Parliament and the devolved assemblies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of that reply, and the fact that we have placed on record our concern that, as far as possible, the presumption should be that information should be in the public domain, I am happy—as, I am sure, is my hon.

	<div class='title'>ADVISORY COMMITTEES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this clause, the Government are trying to have it both ways. The clause revisits subjects that we have already covered, but there are a number of differences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency is supposed to be a United Kingdom body. In this clause more than any other, however, the Government seem to be going out of their way to break down that national authority by creating advisory committees for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Yet again, there is the idiosyncrasy of no separate provision for England. Although it is within the Minister's powers to set up such a committee for England—which makes this clause different from earlier ones—there is no stated intention to do so, as there is for the other three parts of the United Kingdom. What is the role of those
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
advisory committees unless it is to advise the agency of differences in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland? That could lead to different policies or different levels of enforcement, as we discussed earlier, or to advise not to enforce the legislation as heavily on Welsh local authorities as on English or Scottish local authorities. I fail to see what role a regional advisory committee can play other than running the risk of breaking down national policy into different policies for different parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said this morning, Scotland or Northern Ireland could decide to pass legislation stipulating that the power should be completely devolved. We may argue that that is not sensible, but that is their democratic right. At present, however, that is not what is intended. We should therefore stick to a UK-wide agency, a UK-wide policy, and, therefore, UK-wide advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That also raises the issue of who is paying, which we shall probe the Government on later in the Committee stage. Clearly, the money will come from the UK Treasury, but will some of it come from money allocated to the Welsh Assembly, and some from money allocated to the Scottish Parliament? Alternatively, will it all come from the Department of Health's allocation? That will lead to comparisons between who is paying, who is advising and where the money is being spent. I would find it difficult to account to my constituents for the expenditure of English taxpayers' money on the promulgation of advice in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland different from that being given in England. If the Government insist on devolution within the Food Standards Agency, and the devolving of that advice, that seems to breach the principle espoused by the Ministers that it should be a United Kingdom-wide body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the absurdity, to which I referred earlier, of England's again not being covered. If England is not required in the Bill to have an advisory committee, what is the role of the other advisory committees? If it is to advise the Food Standards Agency on variations in custom and practice in the other parts of the United Kingdom, who will advise the Minister on such variations in England?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is questionable whether there are variations between the different parts of the United Kingdom, but if we accept that there are, there must also be differences in England. Someone must therefore advise on the English dimension. There is no mechanism in the proposed system for the provision of such advice. Unless the Minister were persuaded to create an English advisory committee under the powers granted by the clause, there would be no advice available on English matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency will not be short of advice. Hon. Members will have read the research paper helpfully produced by the Library, which provides a good organogram. That tells us that the Veterinary Products Committee and the Advisory Committee on Pesticides, both statutory committees, will provide advice to the agency, although I am not suggesting that they will be subordinate to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
The research paper then lists the non-statutory committees, to which schedule 2 also refers. I shall return to that schedule later, as it is relevant. A stack of committees will advise the Food Standards Agency on food related issues: the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food, the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes, the Food Advisory Committee, the Consumer Panel, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, the Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs, the Committee on the Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy—which we discussed earlier in the proceedings—and the Committee on the Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment. That raft of different advisory committees, all with different specialisms, will advise the agency. I fail to understand what extra levels of advice, all of which would require the setting up of another level of bureaucracy, could be relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to schedule 2, because I was staggered to note that paragraph 5 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Agency may pay to the members of an advisory committee established under section 5 such remuneration or allowances in respect of expenses (or both) as the Agency may determine."</p></blockquote>
That gives a completely open-ended power to the agency to spend what it likes on advisory committees. It also deals only with the payment of members of the advisory committees, not with the payment of the support systems that will have to be created to provide them with the necessary secretariat and back-up. Paragraph 6 of schedule 2 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any expenditure incurred by an advisory committee established under section 5 shall be defrayed by the Agency."</p></blockquote>
That is fine from an accountability point of view, but it still leaves the potential for huge expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 7(1) of schedule 2 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State or the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food may direct that any advisory committee"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the non-statutory advisory committees, which could be one or all of those that I listed—
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall … be treated as if it had been established by the Agency".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 7(3)(a) refers to other advisory committees that may be established
	<br><blockquote><p>"after the day on which this paragraph comes into force."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, in clause 5, the Government propose to set up a panoply of advisory committees in addition to the statutory and non-statutory ones that will provide advice to the FSA. There will be a system of regional advisory committees, although England will not have such a committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is questionable whether there is any logic in geographical differences justifying different advisory committees for different parts of the United Kingdom. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border would have made that point, had he spoken to his amendments. However, if there is a justification for such committees, why on earth does England not have one? England's geographical
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
differences are similar to those in other parts of the United Kingdom—if, indeed, such differences exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the entire clause, which is why I am speaking in the stand part debate, rather than having tabled amendments. There is no way of diluting the proposals, which will introduce an extra massive level of bureaucracy with no real benefit, given the list of committees that I read out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the Minister can be extremely persuasive about the benefits and purposes of the clause, I shall advise my hon. Friends to vote against its inclusion in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend, I am extremely anxious about the clause, which must be read in conjunction with clause 23 and schedule 2. Taken together, the three provisions show that the agency is not independent, but a creature of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State"—</p></blockquote>
I assume that that is a reference to the Secretary of State for Health—
	<br><blockquote><p>"may, after consulting the Agency, direct that an advisory committee … shall be established".</p></blockquote>
Clause 23(2)(c) specifies that the agency must take into account the advice of advisory committees. Schedule 2(7)(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State or the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food may direct that any advisory committee specified in the direction shall, from such date as may be so specified, be treated as if it had been established by the Agency."</p></blockquote>
In other words, the Secretary of State or the Minister of Agriculture may direct the agency to establish an advisory committee, whose advice it must then take into account. Therefore, the Minister of Agriculture will have complete control over that aspect of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 23(2)(c) states that the agency is obliged to take into account advisory committees' advice
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether or not given at the Agency's request".</p></blockquote>
In other words, the Minister of Agriculture can ask an advisory committee to study a certain subject and the agency will be required to take into account its advice. The Minister's control over the agency, therefore, follows a straightforward path.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman not missing a trick, as several advisory committees feed into that process? The FSA will, therefore, treat the Government as an intelligent customer when it gives advice. The Government would get information from different advisory committees, which will be coherently co-ordinated. Is that not a real benefit, as opposed to 10 committees providing different advice from different sources? A single agency will pull everything together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's intervention is interesting. With different advisory committees spinning around all over the place, the agency will have an impossible job. It will be trying to keep everyone happy, but will end up by keeping no one happy. I fail to see what that extra tier of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0506">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
bureaucracy will achieve, other than to increase the cost to the agency and make its functions considerably less transparent and, as a result, the public will begin to lose their confidence in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like clarification about who in the agency will decide when the advisory committees are set up, other than at the direction of the Minister? Will it be the chairman acting alone? Will it be the chairman acting with the majority of his or her members? Who will decide whether to set up the advisory committees? Who will decide when they should be disbanded? It is all very well setting up the committees, but, having set them up, I can assure the Minister that it will be more difficult to get rid of them. When the Government want to do that, every pressure group under the sun will create all sorts of publicity about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New Labour, new committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes and, by the sound of it, it will be new Labour, many new committees. Something will be created with the potential for huge confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a final, serious point, will the Minister say in what circumstances pressure groups or other organisations will be able to ask the agency to set up an advisory committee? All sorts of advisory committees will be set up with vested interests that might not necessarily be in the best interests of the proper working functions of the agency. I look forward with interest to the Minister's reply. Clauses 5 and 23 and schedule 2 will establish a dangerous set of precedents and the hon. Gentleman must clarify precisely how the interaction between the two clauses and the schedule will work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse what has been said. I do not see the point of clause 5. We are repeating this morning's debate. The Minister clarified why there should be regional directors, in that, having set up, for example, the devolved Parliament in Scotland, there must be a person to liaise with. I accepted that explanation. However, I do not understand the need for a regional advisory committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory notes state that the committees will provide
	<br><blockquote><p>"a focus for Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland interests in food safety and standards."</p></blockquote>
To go back to this morning's debate, I thought that we were trying to set national standards. Why should the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish have different standards from people in the other parts of the United Kingdom?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not dealt with that, and when we have the pleasure of his reply I should like him to focus on the ban of beef on the bone. That will come to the forefront shortly; it is being debated in the Assembly at present and it will probably be landed on his plate before the House goes into recess. Before the Bill is enacted, the Government will have to decide how to maintain national standards of food safety if, for example, one devolved region breaks the ring and, from its research, decides that beef on the bone is safe, although central Government have declared that it is unsafe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
Advisory committees will make the position worse. The incentive will be to dash off in every direction finding reasons for justifying the existence of the Welsh committee, for example. The committees will develop their own dynamic in justifying the continuation and expansion of their own remit. That is built into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider schedule 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not debating schedule 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are debating clause 5, which refers under subsection (4) to schedule 2, so it is in order to refer to it. As you have not denied that, Mr. Gale, I shall quickly comment on schedule 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Clause 5(4) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schedule 2 (which contains supplementary provisions about advisory committees) has effect."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 1 of schedule 2 refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any advisory committee established under section 5(1)",</p></blockquote>
and paragraph l(2)(b) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other persons as may be appointed by the appropriate authority, after consulting the Agency."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, I entirely endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold. The risk is that the regional advisory committees will develop their own dynamic, losing the focus of the Bill as stated in clause 1—the promotion of food safety and information. We should concentrate on those matters; we should not give a blank cheque to a new institution so that it can create another tier of bureaucracy without any food basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the agency to concentrate on food, not on building little empires all around the constituent parts of the United Kingdom. Little empires are created very easily. As I said, schedule 2 refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other persons as may be appointed by the appropriate authority".</p></blockquote>
There is no limit to that provision; there is no sell-by date. Much worse, paragraph 5 of schedule 2, which deals with remuneration—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I said that the hon. Gentleman could try my patience a little. He is now trying it too far. We cannot debate schedule 2 now. The hon. Gentleman should return to the debate on clause 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand what you have said, Mr. Gale. I hope that the Committee has got the gist of my speech. The creation of regional advisory committees is not in the interests of national food safety nor of the agency. They will create little empires and there is no limit on how much they can spend, on their duration or on their remit. They could be a dangerous diversion from the agency's central aim, which is to provide information that will promote food safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
