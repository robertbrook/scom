</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Whittingdale(Maldon and East Chelmsford)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook, I wish to raise a matter that is causing great concern to many people. When we debated the sittings motion, I referred to the concern about Inland Revenue press release IR 35, which affects people who organise their affairs as personal service companies. At that time I expressed anxiety about the fact that we had been informed that legislation would be included in next year's Finance Bill, although the measures would be retrospective and come into effect from 1 April 2000. At that time, there was some doubt about whether the consultation exercise that was under way was genuine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concern has been amplified tenfold by the Government's decision to table a new clause to the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill to implement the proposals relating to national insurance contributions. It seems that if the full package is put into effect, amendments to the Finance Bill will be required. Will the Minister make an immediate statement to allay people's concern about how genuine the consultation is, and to make it clear that the Government will not table new clauses for the Finance Bill, and that any legislation will be delayed until there has been an
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
opportunity for all those affected by the proposals to make representations to the Government and to have them properly taken into account? At the moment, it seems that the Government intend to bulldoze the matter through with no attempt to listen to the real concern among those who will be affected by the measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to hear that mat is not a point of order for the Chair. My experience of the Committee to date is that its atmosphere has been harmonious and reasonable, as it should be—and it had better stay that way. I shall permit the Minister to comment either now or later on what the hon. Gentleman has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to mat point of order, Mr. Cook. I shall respond to the hon. Gentleman. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor made it clear in the Budget statement that a full year's notice is being given before we legislate on the matter. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Inland Revenue is consulting representative bodies and inviting comments on the proposals in advance of drafting the legislation. I assure him that the Government intend to legislate on the matter in the next Finance Bill. His concern that legislation may be included in the Bill before us is unfounded. We are consulting, and the consultations are real. The outcome will form our judgment in terms of draft legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Dorrell	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Charnwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook. I was listening carefully to the Paymaster General. Will she elaborate further on this important point? The new clause that the Government tabled contained a specific set of definitions of circumstances in which a new statutory basis for the taxation of personal service companies would apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's stated policy, which underlies the Bill, is that we should seek to align as closely as possible the tax bases for contributions and for income tax. As a result of those consultations—I accept the Paymaster General's assurance that the consultations will be serious—they may conclude that the tax base that underlies the new clause tabled to the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill is erroneous, and they may want to refine it. If so, will the Paymaster General give an assurance that the Government will amend that new clause? That would ensure that the tax bases for national insurance contributions and for income tax will continue to be brought into line, rather than diverging, as would happen if the tax base contained in that new clause were left unamended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extraordinary for points of order to be raised in this way and for the Paymaster General to answer them. However, I shall permit such an approach on this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Burnett	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and West Devon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook. I hope that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>217</span>
during the consultation process to which the Paymaster General referred, the Government will give serious consideration to easing the fiscal penalties of disincorporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall permit the Paymaster General to respond on this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have made my point. When the Paymaster General has responded we shall get on with the debate. If Committee members need to make further points, they should do so at the appropriate time in the ensuing debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chancellor announced on Budget day the Government's intention to include in next year's Finance Bill proposals on the avoidance of national insurance contributions, and on pay-as-you-earn. I have already said that the Government are undertaking genuine consultations—there is no point in such consultations if one is not prepared to listen to responses—and I cannot help Opposition Members further at this stage. I look forward to discussing the matter in next year's Finance Bill Committee, when I hope properly to allay Opposition Members' fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned on Thursday we were discussing amendments Nos. 53, 62 and 63. For the Committee's convenience, I hope that you will grant me some latitude, Mr. Cook, and permit me to recap some of the ground that we covered on Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will introduce the so-called highly spun 1 Op tax rate, which will apply only to incomes above the personal allowance of £4,300, and only to the first tranche of £1,500. In other words, a very narrow band of income is involved—the rate will apply to people who earn between £4,300 and £5,800. Page 13 of the Red Book states that introducing the rate will involve £1.8 billion, which is indexed for the year 2001–02.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people on low incomes will have been cruelly deceived by the proposal, which will not apply to savings. A cruel deceit is being practiced on some of the lowest-paid pensioners, and on others, in this country. A press release from the Treasury—HMT 3—which accompanied this highly spun measure, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A new 10p rate of income tax … will apply to the first £1500 of taxable income from April 1999."</p></blockquote>
One might conclude from that that the proposal would apply to income from savings. Even worse are the explanatory notes, which state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"From 6 April 1999, the lower rate of income tax will be replaced by a starting rate of 10 per cent, for most sources of income."</p></blockquote>
The Government have deliberately misled some of those who are on the lowest incomes—the proposal
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
will not apply to savings. Why will the 10p rate not apply to savings? Amendment No. 63—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Cawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Goole)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> I will give way in a moment, and as we have been up all night, I hope that the hon. Gentleman's intervention will be sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are serious matters. This is yet another cruel measure that will hit people on the lowest incomes, as will the measure to take away dividend tax credit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cawsey </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in a minute, if he will be patient. He has been up all night; I am sure that he can wait another minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a cruel measure that will apply to people with the lowest incomes and savings. Amendment No. 63 seeks to disapply some parts of the Income Tax Acts so that those tranches of income can be applied in the order in which the taxpayer wishes to apply them. At present, this tranche applies only to earned income, and thereby introduces the new concept of a savings income surcharge. That concept dates back to the dark ages of the previous Labour Government in the 1970s—I thought that we had got away from that years ago. It seems that old Labour has been reincarnated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the hon. Gentleman got out of the wrong side of the bed today. I can assure him that sensible contributions will continue to be made from this side of the Committee, although I cannot speak for the other side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have just heard a repeat of the argument that the Opposition put forward during last Thursday's debate. They persist in perpetuating the myth that the information released on Budget day did not include the fact that the 10p tax rate did not apply to earnings from savings. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to paragraph 1 of the Inland Revenue press release IR 1, which clearly states that the 10p starting rate will not apply to income from savings. That was made clear on Budget day, and has been clear ever since. The hon. Gentleman even referred to the press release, yet still tried to suggest that the fact was not announced on Budget day. That is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no objection to the hon. Gentleman's opposing the measures. That is a policy matter for the Opposition. However, he should be honest in what he says about the press release.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that I had not given way. Does the hon. Gentleman think that pensioners and people on low incomes in my constituency are going to delve into the great detail of the Budget press releases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is your job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will find himself having to deal with a great many representations from his constituents, who are going to be most annoyed when they discover that the Government have excluded earnings on savings from the 10p rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman seen the Treasury press release HMT 3, which came out on Budget day? The first paragraph describes the new 10p rate, and I will quote it, because it is an important statement of what the Government tried to do on Budget day. It states that the measures include:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A new 10p rate of income tax which will apply to the first £1,500 of taxable income from April 1999. The Government has consistently said it would introduce a 10p starting rate of tax when it was economically right to do so. The 10p rate will halve the tax bill for 1.8 million people, take a further 300,000 out of income tax altogether, and boost work incentives while helping to create a fairer and more efficient tax system."</p></blockquote>
There was no mention—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Work incentives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was no mention of savings income being subject to a different rate of tax. Opposition members of the Committee condemn that deliberate manipulation of public opinion by press releases that conceal the truth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am anxious to preserve the effective working of the Committee. I must, therefore, remind hon. Members that interventions should be brief and to the point. I have been tolerant so far, but I shall not continue to be so. Interventions will be brief, and pertinent to the issue raised by the person who has the Floor. There is plenty of time, and I shall see to it that any hon. Member who wishes to make a point will have all the time in the world to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to amplify what you have just said, Mr. Cook, but I hope that when we get interventions, they will be effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making a point for which I was just beginning to develop the argument. As I said, the clause will discriminate against savers on low incomes rather than those with modest occupational, personal, or company pension schemes. I shall develop that point by providing some examples.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Hertfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my constituency, pensioners were genuinely surprised to discover that the provision would not apply to savings income. Does my hon. Friend share that experience, and does not he agree that we should not criticise such people by saying, "Oh well, they didn't read the press releases properly", given that the Government are capable of spinning such material?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. We are talking about people with modest savings that they have worked hard for during their entire working lives, whose state pension will take them just over the threshold. Instead of taxing such people at a 10 per cent, rate, this mean-minded measure will subject them to the complexity of the entire tax system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colne Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make this point first, because it is important. We should simplify the tax system and make it easy for people to operate. In particular, people should not be expected to incur the expense of employing professionals to prepare their personal assessment forms. Why cannot the rate of taxation on savings be the same as that for income tax? The lower rate of income tax will be 10 per cent., the basic rate will be 23 per cent, and the higher rate will be 40 per cent. There will be new savings regime rates of 20 per cent, and 40 per cent., and new dividend income tax regime rates of 20 per cent, and 32.5 per cent. Some of the people who are least able to deal with such matters will have to understand a system that is becoming mind-bogglingly complex. We should be simplifying the system for those with modest incomes and savings so that they can easily comply with the law and pay what we hope will be a small amount of tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman announcing a new Conservative party policy of introducing a 10p rate on savings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot announce anything on my party's behalf. [HON MEMBERS: "Oh."] The Government are responsible for such matters, and the Opposition should point out the folly of their actions. The measure is mind boggling. I do not understand why the Government want to hit some of those who have worked hard for their small savings. Age Concern and other organisations have also criticised the Government's plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I was interrupted by the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey), I said that the Government were returning to the arcane concept of an investment savings surcharge. No distinction should be drawn between those whose small amount of earned income is in a company pension scheme and those who have built up hard-earned savings during their entire working lives. I have received representations on the matter from several constituents. One man, on whose door I knocked during the local government elections, said, "I began my working life on only £5 a week. In those days, I could save only a very modest amount. I have saved all my life, and now my small savings will be hit."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are determined to press on with their legislation, it would be sensible to adopt the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
amendment, which would disapply part of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. I shall cite some useful examples of the foolish way in which the clause will operate. The Chartered Institute of Taxation gave the example of a pensioner who, like many people, is on a state pension of £4,000 a year, and who has built up an additional income of £2,000. Three different pensioners have exactly the same income: pensioner A's income is dividends, pensioner B's income is bank interest and pensioner C's income is retirement annuity. They have the same taxable income which for pensioner A is £5,800, for pensioner B is £5,944 and for pensioner C is £5,972. The measure will effect people on fairly modest incomes of up to £107 a week, which is not much by anyone's standards. It is pernicious because it applies to some of the poorest people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me make one further point. We have received numerous representations on the matter. There are three ways in which the Government could use £1.8 billion to benefit some of the poorest people in this country. First, they could do what they have done and introduce a 10p band; secondly, they could widen the existing lower rate of income tax; thirdly they could increase the personal allowance. Increasing the personal allowance, which is what the Conservative Government did in their latter years in office, would be the best way, because it would disapply the tax system altogether for people on low incomes, and they would not have to complete a self-assessment form. Instead, they could get on with their lives without dealing with the bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, under this proposal, people on modest in comes will have to complete a self-assessment form, many for the first time. I do not know how they will cope. The Red Book tells us what the measure will cost in tax forgone, but what is the compliance cost? Nothing in the press releases specifies mat. How much will it cost the Revenue to deal with the people who will have to apply the myriad different tax rates? The Government have an obligation to tell, us because they have made bad tax law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has moved off the point that I intended to make, but I am concerned about how the various rates will affect pensioners with different incomes, such as dividends, bank interest and retirement annuity. Does he agree that the Government are turning the tax system into a national lottery? It will be difficult for people to decide how to allocate their savings in a tax-efficient way. We are talking about people on modest incomes who will not be able to afford professional advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
Gentleman for that intervention, which underscores my point. I am drawing attention to the plight of people who will have to complete a self-assessment form, which will bring them into the income tax system for the first time. I agree with the hon. Gentleman; I do not know how they will cope with the complexity of the system. I thing that they will declare their income on the self-assessment form and ask the Inland Revenue to complete the calculation, which they are entitled to do if the forms are returned on time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should be more specific about the compliance costs, which we are never told, of each complex tax change that they introduce. How many more civil servants will be involved? Would it not be better to raise the personal allowances to the level that would cover the amount that the Government would otherwise have given away? That would take a huge number of savers out of the tax net.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should tell us their long-term plans. Will they harmonise savings rates and income tax rates? Why is there a difference? What is the idea of having differential rates of taxation when the longer-term rate of capital gains tax is 10 per cent? We now have a new highly spun lower rate that will apply to very few people. Why are the Government introducing that measure of complexity? I look forward to hearing their explanation. We hope that in time, they will come round to the idea of simplifying the tax system, because that is what they should be doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not keep introducing measures that hit some people on the lowest incomes. There is no chance that when those people reach pensionable age, they will be able to make up their pensions or savings. I ask the Government to reconsider the matter. I do not know whether we will have an opportunity to vote on the clause, but if not, the Government should come back on Report and say why they keep hitting the people with the most modest savings and incomes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a brief intervention on amendment No. 62, which is a probing amendment, to elicit from whichever Minister is to reply to the debate an answer to some questions asked by those in the profession, in particular the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Chartered Institute of Taxation. Those organisations are concerned about whether subsections (8) and (9) of clause 19 introduce a change to the taxation of life policies where the taxpayer is liable to tax at the higher rate. Indeed, the Institute of Chartered Accountants raised some concern that the clause could be read as imposing tax on the difference between me 40 per cent, rate and the 10 per cent. rate. That is not the Government's intention, but it is unclear from the legislation, so it would be helpful if the Minister could clarify the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in parliamentary questions to the Chancellor, I have tried to raise the issue of an already existing covenant. Where a covenant is made to a charity, the payer is entitled to a deduction on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
payment at the basic rate of tax, and the charity can recover the tax from the Inland Revenue. Following the introduction of the 20 per cent, savings rate, technically, the payer should have to hand over to the Revenue the difference between the basic rate of 23 per cent, and the savings rate of 20 per cent. However, I understand that the Revenue has not taken that up, because, at 3 per cent., it was not worth recovering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now the gap between the 23 per cent, and the new lower rate of 10 per cent, is 13 per cent., so it is possible, in theory, that the Inland Revenue could recover extra tax on covenanted payments. Therefore many people who were busy paying small or large amounts of money to charity by way of a covenant could suddenly find that they were subject to a tax bill from the Inland Revenue, solely because of the Government's decision to introduce the lower rate. It would be helpful if the Minister would say whether the Inland Revenue intends to enforce that provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was unable to attend the final part of the Committee's sitting on Thursday, but I have read what was said. In fact, I bumped into the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale), who was on the way to hear Meatloaf. I know that Mr. Loaf has had a lot say about tax—"VAT out of hell", and suchlike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendments Nos. 62 and 63, the basic thrust of the Opposition's argument is that a 10p rate should be applied to £1,500 of savings as well as earnings. The idea behind their argument is that there should be equity, but that argument is fallacious. There is not equity now between the taxation of savings and earnings—20p versus 23p. Secondly, the idea behind the 10p earnings rate is the work incentive. After all, there is no trade-off between savings and work as such. There is no reason why we should accept the fallacious argument of equity to support the amendment, which would cost £85 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition say, "Oh well, it is only £85 million." Someone quoted the 	<i>The Daily Mail,</i>which stated that that was one five thousandth of the £320 billion that the Government spend each year, so it did not matter. That is sheer irresponsibility. The Chancellor pointed out at Question Time that his mandarins thought that the cumulative cost of Opposition amendments was more than £7 billion. I calculate that the figure may be higher. Lumping more and more money together in such an opportunist and irresponsible way is wrong, and it is something that the taxpayer needs to know about next time there is a decision to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are not the figures quoted by the hon. Gentleman merely the tax rises imposed by the Government, despite the fact that they fought the election on a platform of not raising taxes? The Opposition simply want to make the Labour party stick to its manifesto pledges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that farcical point. Any Government's key instrument for delivering change must be the fiscal mechanisms at their disposal. It would be absurd not to expect a rebalance—some taxes would go down, and some would go up. The hon. Gentleman's charge about specific plans for such a pattern of tax changes is wrong. The incoming Government's specific commitment was not to raise income tax. Rather than being raised, income tax has been massively reduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has said before in this Committee that tax changes should change people's behaviour. Is he suggesting that the tax change under discussion should cause pensioners to go out and spend all their savings, thus forcing them back into work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course not. I am glad that the hon. Member for Cotswold has spoken, as he suggested that pensioners had been "cruelly deceived" by the change. Pensioners are no worse off; they will simply not enjoy a reduction in tax rates. The equity argument is fallacious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> To Meatloaf? Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the Government had introduced tax rate cuts. Will he confirm that one of the results of the clause will be that 4.4 million income tax payers who have a taxable income of between £1,500 and £4,300 will pay 23p in the pound instead of 20p in the pound?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the vast majority of taxpayers, the 10p and 23p rates constitute a net tax giveaway, which will provide work incentives. Hon. Members can always identify, as a debating point, small numbers of losers, instead of the vast number of winners. The overall impact of the measure is to increase work incentives. The trade-off in relation to savings income is not the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an important point about what was and was not said, and Opposition Members are trying to play games with it. The Chancellor has used phrases such as "encouraging work" and "making work pay" in relation to the amount of money that people earn. Does not that make the intention behind the 10p starting rate clear?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Various references were made to income tax rates in the press releases, including the statement that they were aimed at incentives, not savings. It would be absurd for anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of tax affairs to think for one moment that work incentives and savings tax rates were related.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman name any studies that predict the number of people who will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>225</span>
induced to return to work as a result of the 10p starting rate of tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have a list of such studies in front of me. Anyone with any knowledge of simple demand and supply curves—people studying GCSE economics, as well as those who have degree-level economics, as I do—knows that if tax rates, the cost of entry and the trade-off between leisure and work favour work, more work will occur. I am surprised that a former Financial Secretary should ask such a rudimentary and silly question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking about incentives and the effect on work supply. Has he not heard of the backward-leaning labour supply curve? It is a recognised phenomenon in micro-economic theory, and should be familiar to those with degrees in economics, that if a smaller amount of work is more profitable, people work less.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not respond to that, but turn to the complexity in the administration of tax affairs. Banks and building societies take tax from savings interest at source. When investors receive interest from a bank or building society, it has already been taxed. If there are 10p and 20p rates, it will be difficult for banks and building societies to administer tax deduction because they will not know whether investors have savings elsewhere and what rate is charged on the interest, so the administration would flood back to the Inland Revenue. It would be difficult to administer the change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman explain how the complexity would flood back to the Inland Revenue in these days of self-assessment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the complexity would arise when the tax on people's savings moved from one rate to another. If a bank does not know a saver's marginal rate, it cannot tax at source. That is my simple point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), who is not now in the Room, said that the debate should be couched in terms of the Government's social objectives for redistribution, and that we should be discussing increased tax allowances. Various instruments, including allowances, are available, to achieve various objectives. It is clear that the objective of the change is work incentive and not social distribution. Other mechanisms are available for social distribution and to channel money to different groups—for example, child benefit and working families tax credit. The Chancellor has introduced a package of measures to fulfil various objectives, and the social objective is not relevant in this instance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about pensioners. Is the hon. Gentleman suggestingt that pensioners who receive a basic state pension should be discriminated

against because they have savings and do not work? Why can we not make an exception for people who are over the age of retirement? They cannot increase their income unless they go out to work. Why can their savings not be exempted from the measure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should speak more slowly. Pensioners are not losing. The Chancellor is providing incentives for people to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Pensioners?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The impact on pensioners is that if more people work they create more wealth for a more prosperous economy—so the Government are, for example, spending an extra £40 billion on health and education. Expenditure on health is of direct benefit for pensioners because they are great consumers of health products. There are benefits for pensioners in the trade-off; they will certainly not lose, and in time they will gain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Toward the end of our discussion on Thursday, when Mr. Butterfill was in the Chair, we were trying to ascertain how the Opposition would pay for the amendment. To be fair, we had some interesting answers. The right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) suggested that the social security budget could be altered at the drop of a hat to find £85 million, and that to do so is normal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In case the hon. Gentleman misunderstood me—perhaps I spoke too quickly— I was talking about "the roundings", with which he may not be familiar. The roundings could be described as the small change in the social security budget. In discussions between the Department of Social Security and the Treasury, there is always some debate on estimating changes and the roundings. Within those calculations, an opportunity always arises to find the sums to which we are referring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman—I, too, shall speak more slowly—for confirming my observation that the Opposition expect £85 million to be found at the drop of a hat. It is interesting to discover the way in which the Opposition managed the economy and the social security budget when in government. The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) and the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford suggested that the money could be found by cutting contributions to the European Union. I wonder whether certain Opposition Back Benchers would agree with that idea. We are already seeing a split in the Opposition on the question of where the money might be found.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the hon. Gentleman's comments. Have his Front Bench colleagues granted him authority to imply that the Government—unlike any other Government in the far mists of time, whether Labour or Tory—undertake correctly to estimate the social security budget to

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yet again we hear confirmation that, when in government, the Opposition did not know what happened to £85 million; perhaps it fell from a back pocket.

Sadly, amendment No. 53 would not achieve its intended aim. It would leave savings income and capital gains taxable at the lower rate up to the basic rate limit. However, the lower rate would not be defined and, as a result, such income and gains would not be taxed at all. I somewhat wryly note that Opposition Members are looking at the Bill again. I should tell the Committee that my hon. Friends, who worked valiantly today and last Thursday, have been labouring under a terrible misapprehension, for which I apologise, because they have been talking about a figure of £85 million. But they have been completely and utterly wrong—I feel my parliamentary career draining from me—because the amendment would cost nearly £2 billion, not the £85 million that was suggested by the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman.

know how carefully the Revenue examines such measures. Amendment No. 53 would leave savings income, such as bank and building society interest and capital gains, taxable at the lower rate of tax up to the basic rate limit. However, the lower rate of tax would not be defined and, as a result, such income and gains would not be taxed. The calculation was made on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 62 is a technical amendment. It makes no substantial changes, but it would prevent minor changes from being made to the terminology in the Taxes Acts that the introduction of the starting rate of income tax makes necessary. Without those changes, references to the lower rate that had become meaningless would be left in place. I assure the Committee that the subsections make consequential changes. They do not make changes of substance to the provisions that they amend. Indeed, they parallel the changes that were made when the Conservatives introduced the lower rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To be absolutely clear, can the Financial Secretary confirm that subsections (8) and (9) are not intended to introduce any changes regarding the taxation of life policies where the taxpayer is liable at the higher rate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The intended effect of amendment No. 63 is to allow an individual with any unused 10p rate band to set it against savings income. However, it would not achieve that. It is technically deficient and would not work. Important points were raised on both sides of the Committee. The debate concentrated on why the new 10p rate does not apply to savings. The 10p rate is a work incentive measure, which will help people to keep more of what they earn. All taxpayers in work will benefit from the new 10p rate.

Savings are already taxed generously and savers can benefit from the new individual savings account. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary spent much time ensuring that that scheme got off me ground successfully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the rate will help people to keep more of what they earn.

As My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole pointed out on Thursday and today that the Budget day press release from the Inland Revenue, IR 1, spelled out the position clearly on its first page. It stated:

The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) talked about the general decline in the savings ratio. It is a bit much for Opposition Members to criticise us. Under the previous Government's boom and bust policies—we have not heard that phrase for some time, but I thought that it was about time to wake up Opposition Members by using it—the savings ratio collapsed to just 3 per cent, in 1988. I have forgotten what positions the right hon. Members for Fylde and for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) held at that time.

We have heard much this morning about savings, as we did on Thursday. The worst enemy of saving is high inflation, which eats up the real value of savings. Let us remember what things were like when the Conservatives were in government. Inflation rose to 21 per cent, in the early 1980s, and was running at almost 10 per cent, in the early 1990s, by contrast, we now have economic stability and low inflation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to clarify a point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde, because I think that the Financial Secretary said that the savings ratio had gone up to 7 per cent. I should like to read to her a paragraph from the Red Book, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Real household disposable income is estimated to have risen by 0.5 per cent, in 1998, with the effect on spending cushioned by a fall in the saving ratio to 7 per cent., down from rates of over 9 per cent, in preceding years."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, no, no. I appreciate that it has been a long and interesting night, but if the hon. Gentleman had listened he would have heard that I said that it was predicted to rise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> May I bring the Financial Secretary back to the staring rate of income tax, and ask her a specific question about the effect of the introduction of the new starting rate on the way in which the Revenue treats deeds of covenant? She will know that charities benefit from repayments of income tax, which have historically been paid at basic rate. Will she assure the Committee that the Revenue will not seek to distinguish, as within the fine print of the law it could, between starting rate and basic rate, and that beneficiaries of deeds of covenant will benefit at the rate of 23 per cent.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The right hon. Gentleman anticipates what I am going to say. He raises an important point with which I shall deal a little later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite rightly, there has been a great deal of discussion about pensioners, but I was disappointed that mere was no mention of the tremendous package for pensioners introduced in the Budget—the minimum income guarantee, the five-fold increase in winter fuel allowance and the minimum tax guarantee,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
which has increased pensioners' personal allowances well above indexation. Of course, there has been no mention of the fact that it was the Conservative party that put VAT on fuel—possibly the harshest measure that pensioners have ever encountered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Wells and the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) said that the clause creates complexity and they referred to self-assessment. Of course, I cannot mention the hon. member for Kingston and Surbiton without congratulating him on the success of Kingstonian football team. I am sure that we all watched that result with interest last weekend. I shall go no further down that route, but I felt that it would be churlish not to mention it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new 10p rate is a work incentive, and will help the low paid. In addition, for those subject to self-assessment, the Inland Revenue will gladly do all the tax calculations for anyone submitting their tax return by 30 September. I remember that the right hon. Member for Fylde was the pioneer of self-assessment; he led the seminars on the issue. I also remember the great courtesy that he showed me when I was in opposition, by sending his officials to see me because he knew that I had an interest in raising the issue of self-assessment. We can pay tribute to the work done by the right hon. Gentleman, knowing that the system will cope admirably as a result of his ministrations.

The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) said that pensioners were disappointed, and that he had received many complaints.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Ruffley(Bury St. Edmunds)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman painted a picture of pensioners having lost out from the introduction of the 10p rate. That is not so. No pensioner is worse off as a result of the introduction of the 10p rate. On the contrary, they will be better off as a result of the Budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruffley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point of my remarks in an earlier sitting was that pensioners believed that they would get the same benefits as those income tax payers who would benefit from the 10p rate. Their complaints were about not the perceived unfairness but the actual unfairness of the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that the hon. Gentleman is putting himself forward as the pensioners; friend. However, I see no evidence for his claim. Two thirds of pensioners pay no tax. The budget has taken 200,000 pensioners out of the tax system. The Inland Revenue will be happy to assist the few pensioners who are in self-assessment. The hon. Gentleman gave us an interesting history of the 20p rate in relation to savings. However, the result of applying the 10p rate to savings would be to bring back all the administrative problems that he described. Pensioners and others
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
would again have to reclaim small amounts of tax from the Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Twickenham spoke of the complexity of different tax treatments for earned and unearned income. However, the previous Conservative Government are responsible for that complexity. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds helpfully explained—I am not sure whether it will help to further his career—that it was a Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1996 who separated savings from earned income, and taxed them differently. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I hear the hon. Gentleman muttering on the Back Benches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruffley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has cast aspersions on what the Opposition have done for pensioners.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman fails to understand that he cannot have it both ways. He cannot criticise us for continuing to do something that was introduced by the Conservative Government, for whom he was a special advisor to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. There is collective amnesia among Opposition members of the Committee.

The hon. Member for Cotswold said that it would have been better to increase the personal allowance than to introduce the 10p rate. That would have given the biggest cash gain to higher paid people. The 10p rate will improve the take-home pay for most people on the low taxable incomes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Financial Secretary square the introduction of the 10p rate, which excludes savers, with the statement in paragraph 5.33 of the Red Book, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government wants to encourage people to save, both to underpin long-term investment and to secure their own financial welfare for the future. This underpins the Government's policy of work for those who can and security for those who cannot."</p></blockquote>
Why have savers been excluded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had thought that I had explained. Clearly, I will have to do so again. Savings are already very generously taxed by this Government. Pensioners, as a group, are tremendously well treated under this Budget, and rightly so after all that they had to put up with under Conservative Governments. One of our aims was to help people in work, and that is the purpose of the 10p rate.

Member for Charnwood spoke about donations to charity. Donations to charity under covenant gift aid and millennium gift aid schemes are treated as paid off a deduction of basic rate tax, which the charity can reclaim from the Inland Revenue. Donors who use such schemes must pay at the basic rate on an amount of their income equivalent to the amount of the donation before the deduction of tax. That ensures that the overall amount of tax relief is correct. That is not a new rule—it has always applied to people who pay no tax, and it applied in 1996 when the previous Government introduced the 20p tax rate for savings. In 1996, the right hon. Member for Fylde, who was then Financial Secretary, told the Finance Bill Committee that it was not a major problem and that only a small minority of lower rate tax payers had covenants. I assure the Committee that that also applies to the new 10p rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the Inland Revenue will inquire into the tax status of people who donate money to charity under those schemes? The Financial Secretary's comments suggest that the Inland Revenue will do so, and that it will deny the charity the payment if it is not satisfied that the donor is paying at the basic rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am saying that exactly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am saying that exactly the same system will operate as before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I must make some progress. I hope that I have demonstrated to the Committee's satisfaction that the amendments are unworkable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have been rather generous in giving way, and I will get into trouble with my Whip if I do so. As an ex-Whip, I am reluctant to do that. Not only are the amendments deficient, but they would have financial consequences that their authors have not foreseen. I hope that I have persuaded the Committee of that. If not, I invite my hon. Friends to oppose the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to speak again, as I sense that the Committee would like to progress. I was seeking, by way of intervention, clarification on an important issue for the charity world. I want to underline the point and define the question more precisely. If the Financial Secretary takes this opportunity to secure advice, the Committee may make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary answered my question by
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
saying that the system will not change. It will remain as it has since the introduction of the lower rate in the 1992 Budget. I understand that, but her problem is that the difference between the basic and lower tax rates is significantly greater than it was and it is, therefore, more material for the charity world to understand precisely the principles that the Inland Revenue intends to adopt. It is not good enough to say that the system will continue as before. The Revenue has not recently made a substantial effort to inquire into the tax status of donors. However, given that the Government will create more material gap, it is important that they make it clear whether the Inland revenue will interpret, under its normal management powers, that it has an obligation to inquire into the tax status of donors before making a payment to recipients of charitable donations as a result of give aid and covenanting arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that when my right hon. Friend and I were Financial Secretaries, there was a gap in the law which the Revenue did not pursue under its normal management powers. The board of the Inland Revenue has that discretion because it is impossible to define every set of circumstances in advance, but the substantial gap between 10 per cent, and 23 per cent.—soon to be 22 per cent.—is a bigger issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the importance of donations to the charity world, it is not good enough for Ministers to say that the system will continue in the same way. I hope that the Financial Secretary will give a clear assurance to the Committee about how the Revenue intends to apply the law. Will it inquire into the tax status of donors to satisfy itself that tax has been deducted at the basic rate, or will it accept, as it has in the past, that the donor of a gift aid or covenanting arrangement can be assumed to have paid tax at the basic rate? Can the Financial Secretary answer that specific question? How will the Revenue apply the law? The issue is important to the world of charities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was rather hoping that the Financial Secretary would respond to my right hon. Friend but, as she seems to have no intention of doing so, I will say in conclusion that I agree with her that this is an important matter, which we have debated in a robust style. She began by suggesting that pensioners should be in no doubt that they would not benefit from the 10p starting rate on their savings income because that was clear in the Chancellor's speech. However, that is not the experience of most pensioners. I quoted from a letter in which a pensioner expressed her utter amazement that she was not going to get the 10p rate on her savings income. I also quoted the senior partner of Grant Thornton, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It wasn't immediately apparent from the Budget that the rate for savers would remain unchanged at 20 per cent."</p></blockquote>
I recall clearly that, following the Budget, Radio 4's "Money Box" programme said that this measure must
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
be an anomaly which the Government would correct in the Finance Bill. A large proportion of the population shared that misunderstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary explained that amendment No. 53 would remove the starting rate. It is, of course, merely a probing amendment. However, there is broad agreement that the main thrust of our amendments, which is to extend the 10p starting rate to savings income, would cost £85 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was the Government's decision to introduce a 10p starting rate for the first £1,500 of income, and it is only fair that it should apply to savings income as well as earned income. All the many professional bodies that I have quoted think the Government's proposal unfair. Our amendments, particularly amendment No. 63, would remove that unfairness, and we want to press it to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wells)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 9, line 12, leave out '20' and insert '10'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 17, in clause 20, page 10, line 7, leave out '10' and insert '0'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I recall royal personages, Mr. Cook, I do not compare you with Queen Victoria. I think more of King Solomon, because it was with such wisdom that you chose amendment No. 16, and grouped it separately from amendment No. 53. Now that I have you on my side, I thank the Financial Secretary for her words of praise for Kingstonian. I hope that she will receive the Whips' dispensation to sign the early-day motion congratulating them which I shall table in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 16 would apply the 10p rate to savings income, which is the effect that the official Opposition sought. I shall not detain the Committee on that issue, because it was discussed in detail during the previous debate. Amendment No. 17, which the Financial Secretary will doubtless say would prove rather more expensive than amendment No. 16, would establish a starting rate of 0p, and have the same effect as increasing the personal income tax allowance. Amendment No. 17 enables us to debate the difference between increasing the allowance and introducing a starting rate of 10p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to establish a starting rate of Op, because the introduction of a 10p rate will not achieve the Government's aim. We heard at length about their belief that a lower starting rate is the best way to encourage people back to work. However, an increase in the personal allowance would ensure that people
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
keep all of any money earned in excess of the existing allowance. Such an increase in the personal allowance would have the same effect as the establishment of a 0 per cent. band. That would be the best way to create the incentive to work, because it would have greater impact on those with the lowest incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is important because, over time, the starting rate at which most people pay tax has reduced as a percentage of average earnings. After the war, people on two thirds of average earnings did not pay income tax, but today people start to pay income tax when they are on half of average earnings. Many tax changes have occurred in the mean time and the indirect tax base has been expanded. People on the lowest incomes—the poorest people in our society— are paying a far greater share of tax than they have done historically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Sally Keeble 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Northampton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the Government's aim is to help those in greatest need? The 10p starting rate targets those on lower incomes, and the change in allowances will help everyone, including the rich. With pensioners, the converse is the case—the best way to help the 27 per cent, of pensioners who have no savings is with the minimum income guarantee and other benefit changes, which will increase their income. That is the best way to help the poorest people in our society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to repeat the debate that we had in the Chamber last night, which was about the best way to help the poorest pensioners. As my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) said, we think that the best way to help the poorest pensioners is to have pension increases that are tiered by age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady suggested that the 10p rate will not be available to the richest, but it will be. On the relevant slice of income, they will pay the 10p rate, just like the poorest people. People on low incomes will not get the full benefit of the 10 per cent, rate, because their incomes will fall between the starting rate for tax and the upper limit of the 10p band. If the Chancellor had used the money differently, he could have given people on those levels of income a full tax cut. It would have been better for them if the money had been used to increase personal allowances. There is no doubt that, however the situation is analysed, it is fairer and more redistributive to channel any extra resources into higher allowances rather than to use them to cut tax rates. That fact is recognised by all the tax experts and specialists outside the House, including the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, the Financial Secretary told the hon. Member for Cotswold that increasing allowances would give more to those on higher levels of earnings. That would be the case if no other action was taken, but when the policy is discussed, in pre-Budget debates, for example, or by the Institute for Fiscal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
Studies, it is assumed that ways will be suggested to ensure that those who pay higher taxes will not benefit disproportionately. That is the spirit in which we tabled amendment No. 17. That amendment's proposed increase in allowances would increase work incentives. It involves a fairer use of the extra resources mat are available to make tax cuts. We heard earlier how the 10p rate means that the tax system has become unnecessarily more complex. The Minister failed to answer the point mat the hon. Member for Cotswold made about the compliance cost of me 10p rate, which affects the Revenue and individual taxpayers, who have to fill in self-assessment forms and who may need an army of accountants to help them to manoeuvre through the tax system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What estimates has the Treasury made of the compliance cost of adding an extra tax rate and how does that compliance cost compare with the cost of increasing the amounts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Gentleman does not agree with me 10p rate, but does he accept that that mat was a Labour party pledge and mat we are doing what we told the electorate we would do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested to see that the Liberal Democrat amendments would not increase income tax by 1p. Have the Liberal Democrats now ditched mat policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course we have not ditched that policy. We reiterate it often, but I am sure, Mr. Cook, that you would not want me to declaim it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a fair point. The pledge was in the Labour party's manifesto, but it was not costed. We asked time and again, but were given no explanation of how it would be paid for. Although Labour Members like to tell us mat we have not costed our policies, when the Labour party went to the electorate, it had not costed its policies. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. I hope that the Minister will respond to my question about compliance costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want a long debate on amendment No. 16, but it is regressive to introduce complexity into taxation of savings. It will affect the poorest people—a group that often includes pensioners. Wealthy people will have no problem manoeuvring around the complexities because they have professional accountants to advise them on the best way of allocating their capital to minimise their tax bill. The poorest pensioners, about whom I thought Labour Members were most concerned—will not receive advice and many will pay more tax than necessary. That is outrageous and the Government should reconsider the matter. We have heard various arguments for taking that line and betraying pensioners. One argument was mat it would cost £85 million, but that was dealt with comprehensively by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
when he explained mat £85 million is a small amount within the overall Budget. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Labour Members object to that, but they were not paying attention to the details of our debate. The right hon. Member for Fylde stated clearly that when Budget items are being analysed, factors of £85 million are chicken feed. Labour Members ask where the money will come from, but they have not explained where they found the £40 billion to which they keep referring. If it is easy for them to find £40 billion, I am sure that they can find £85 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Leslie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Shipley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am looking for some honesty from the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am more than happy to answer the hon. Gentleman. I am told that me cost of amendment No. 16 would be £85 million and that the cost of amendment No. 17 would be around £2 billion, but me Minister may be able to give the Committee a more accurate figure and I am happy to give way to her if she can so do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman think that Labour Members of the Committee will be so assiduous in asking where the money is coming from when the Government find a way out of their dilemma of last night by effecting a climb-down over incapacity benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman makes a salient point. I hope that he is right—although I fear that he may not be—in saying that the Government will back down on that issue. Many people will otherwise be severely hit by the measures that we debated on me Floor of the House last night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to amendment No. 16, I am perplexed as to why the Government have excluded savings from the proposal. The cost argument does not hold water. We heard from several hon. Members that the measure may be a return to old Labour policies, and mat the Government believe that unearned income should be taxed more heavily than earned income. Perhaps that is what lies behind the arguments put forward on the Floor of the House about IR 35. Perhaps the Government think it iniquitous that unearned income does not have national insurance contributions applied to it, and they are therefore looking for ways to tax investment income more heavily. I wish that they would tell us if that is their motivation, so that we could debate the issue more openly. If we were able to do that, we could pull their argument apart within minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Capital is as important to employment, and to investment for jobs, as work incentives. The idea mat we should penalise savings and investment—[HON. MEMBERS: "We are not."] Labour Members say that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
they are not doing so, but the measures penalise savings and investment in relative terms. Hon. Members should know that many, but not all, things in life are relative. The Government are failing to treat the different forms of income equally, which is a great mistake. The proposals are not supported by economic analysis, and they will cause apppalling complications in the tax system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking patent nonsense. The Government are introducing a range of measures, from the new deal to the 10p starting rate, designed to provide incentives for people to return to work. The Government have made no bones about that. The hon. Gentleman's suggestion that they have deliberately missed out savings—thereby penalising pensioners—is a red herring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a fact that the Government have missed out savings from the measure, and this is not the first time that measures that adversely affect pensioners have been introduced. It happened with dividends tax credit and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) has reminded me with retirement relief for capital gains tax, which hit many owners of small businesses, who regarded the increased value of their business as part of their pension. The Government have dramatically increased such taxes and, quite carelessly at times, introduced huge tax increases for the poorest pensioners in all areas of the tax system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This issue has arisen many times. Will the hon. Gentleman accept that anyone in a position to pay tax cannot be defined as "the poorest"? The poorest are those who fall below the threshold for income support, and that would be a better place for us to focus our attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There we have it. We are discussing people whose income is less than £10,000 a year, for whom the Government are increasing the tax burden. I hope that the hon. Lady will be honest enough to go to her constituency, state her views to pensioners there whose income is less than £10,000, and say to them, "You do not matter." I hope that she will do that, because that follows from what she has just said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may not be aware that, in a recent parliamentary answer, the Prime Minister confirmed to me—when I probed his definition of poverty, in the context of helping child poverty—that the people about whom he was speaking were in the lower half of households on below average income. However, many of those people do pay tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is being very helpful. I hope that the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) will reflect on that. In addition, if she wants to target resources on the poorest pensioners,
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
why is she lauding the policy of the £100 fuel allowance, which is not targeted at all, but is the same for rich or poor?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is a disheartening thread of this Government's policies that, time and time again, they introduce policies that impact adversely on the poorest and most vulnerable people in society? I should like to mention two or three examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night, we heard about cuts in widows' pensions. In addition—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will make his two or three examples brief. Otherwise, he will test my patience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Cook. I shall be brief. I shall give just one further example: the abolition of legal aid for personal injury cases, which impacts only on the poorest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's theme is exactly right. I do not ascribe bad motives to the Government; it is just careless policy making. They do not think things through. They focus on political soundbites, headlines, and rabbits out of a hat on Budget day, but they do not think through their policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is incompetence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The right hon. Member for Charnwood says that it is incompetence, and I think he is right. I believe that we shall have to return to this, and that may be the Government's intention. Perhaps, the reason why they did not introduce a 10p rate for savings had nothing to do with cost or ideological prejudice against unearned income, but was because they wanted to save another rabbit—another gizmo— for next year's Budget, so that they can have another cheap headline for £85 million, which is cheap at the price. I should like to be the first to make that prediction. The Government may relent on this issue, but that is a silly way to go about things because, in the meantime, accountants and tax authorities will have to deal with the extra complexity. Rather than take the soundbite approach to policy making, why do not Ministers take the opportunity today to accept the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I feel compelled to qualify, on a minor but important point, the presentation made by the hon. Gentleman in speaking to his amendment—namely, that the Chair is either on no Member's side or could be considered to be on every Member's side. It is the Chair's responsibility to maintain a strictly non-partisan stance, except in the event that there are equal votes, in which case the Chair is required to cast his or her vote in favour of the elected Government. I just wanted to put that on record for the sake of history, and for the benefit of every Committee member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I had always understood that, in the event of a tied vote, the Chair would vote for the status quo, rather than for the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that there are several precedents. That is not strictly in accordance with what I have said, but what I said is what I had been led to believe until today. I shall study the matter with great intensity to ensure that I get it correct. Committee members will note that I did not say, "get it right".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendment No. 16, which answers some of the many criticisms of the Government's tax management. We now have a plethora of rates and an increasingly complex tax and compliance regime. I need only point out the the Committee that basic rate taxpayers who are pensioners have a series of complex rates with which to contend and comply. A pensioner with dividend income will pay 10 per cent., a pensioner with bank interest will pay 20 per cent., and a pensioner on a retirement annuity will pay 10 per cent, on the first £1,500 and 23 per cent, thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Financial Secretary aware that a pensioner whose sole income other than his or her pension is a pensioner bond yielding more that £500 a year must now complete a self-assessment return? Discriminating between earned and investment income introduces unnecessary complexity. Investment income surcharge was abandoned years ago. That was a wise move, not only because of diminished complexity but on the ground of equity—the vast bulk of savings come from taxed income earned during an individual's working life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Financial Secretary pointed out, the Inland Revenue will calculate the tax liabilities of individuals who submit tax returns by 30 September. As I pointed out, there is already a differential rate of 10 per cent. on dividends for basic rate taxpayers. Why do the Government not harmonise the savings rate with the earnings and dividend rate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, is the hon. Gentleman aware that amendment No. 16 would mean that the tax rates on savings would be 10 per cent, and 40 per cent? The amendment would eliminate the 20 per cent, rate, which would cost £1 billion a year. Secondly, is he aware that amendment No. 17 would mean that the 10p rate would become a Op rate? Allowances would therefore increase by £1,500, which, according to the Library, would cost £4 billion. The amendments total cost of £5 billion is much greater than the compliance costs that Opposition Members were moaning about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come on to the question of costs. As I said, I am addressing amendment No. 16, the cost of which I understand would be £85 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax system should be easily understandable. In general, pensioners cannot afford professional help. Amendment No. 16 introduces a measure of
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
simplification and fairness; it is easy for taxpayers to understand and apply, whether or not they are assisted by professional agencies. The cost would be £85 million, as the Paymaster General—in response to a written question—and I have said. A budget surplus of £7.4 billion was announced last month. Can we not afford to spend 1 per cent, of that surplus in the interests of our pensioners and of simplification?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had a thorough discussion on most of the issues that were raised in this debate during our previous debate. I shall therefore endeavour not to detain the Committee for too long. I was tempted, when the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton mentioned King Solomon, to say that I was able, many years ago, to recite word-perfectly all the Kings of Israel and all the Kings of Judah. Sadly—and probably to the advantage of the Committee—I can no longer do so. HON. MEMBERS: "Shame." I know that the Committee is disappointed, especially the Paymaster General, the Economic Secretary and the Whips.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee to resist the amendments. The package that we outlined in the Budget was designed to encourage work by making work pay. The amendments would disturb that balance and compromise the principles of fiscal prudence by introducing costly and badly targeted relief, which would do nothing to improve work incentives or take-home pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 16 would apply the 10p starting rate to all savings income up to the basic rate limit. The hon. Members for Kingston and Surbiton and for Torridge and West Devon mentioned the complexity of the change. It is true that, after the tax year has begun, such a change would cause practical administrative problems for banks and building societies because they would have already deducted tax from the interest that was paid to savers. The amendment would make them revisit every calculation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have no objection to the Financial Secretary saying that our changes could take place in the next financial year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. Perhaps I will get similar offers and we will make some progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Banks and building societies would have to revise the calculations and credit accounts with often small amounts of over-deducted tax. Alternatively, they could continue to deduct tax at 20 per cent., with individuals then submitting claims to the Inland Revenue for the over-deducted tax. The amendment would be time consuming and expensive in both cases. It would do nothing to help work incentives, which is a key principle behind the 10p rate. My colleagues will be interested to know that the amendment would cost the Exchequer almost £1 billion a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 17 would set the new starting rate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
of tax at zero. It is right that people should be able to keep more of what they earn. That is important to the Government. The principle of rewarding work and making it pay lies behind this Budget and previous Budgets. However, the strategy should be delivered in a framework of fiscal prudence. It would not be responsible to abandon that framework. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton asked how much amendment No. 17 would cost. I am delighted to be able to tell him that it would cost an additional £3.6 billion. I can see the look of shock and horror on the faces of Liberal Democrat members. I am almost sorry that I had to give them that figure, but it was my duty. In addition, the amendment would result in Parliament agreeing to a new starting rate of tax while at the same time failing to apply it. That would be nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with the arguments about complexity. No new difficulties will be imposed in respect of compliance. In fact, it is the amendment that would introduce complexity. We believe that the right balance has been struck between improving the rewards for work and encouraging people to save.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary tell the Committee—if not now, in a written response—how much it would cost the Exchequer annually to harmonise the rate for savings and for earnings at 10 per cent, for the first £1,500?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I understand the purpose of the hon. Gentleman's question. However, I shall consult 	<i>Hansard,</i> as I do every evening, and study the matter carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, we have struck the right balance between improving the rewards for work and encouraging people to save. I hope that I have persuaded the Opposition to withdraw the amendments, but if they do not I invite my hon. Friends to oppose them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that, in respect of amendment No. 16,1 may have been spending more of my colleagues' money than I intended. I am humble enough—as the spokesman for the official Opposition no doubt is—to admit that, in seeking to probe and stimulate debate, we made a technical error. Therefore, I do not intend to press amendments Nos. 16 or 17 to a vote, but I hope that the official Opposition, whom we shall support, will press amendment No. 63 to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 57 in clause 20, page 10, leave out line 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of our previous discussion, the amendment may appear rather brutal, as it would remove the 10p starting rate of tax altogether. In principle, I am not against reducing people's tax burden, but I doubt whether the Government have proposed the best means of doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary's justification of the 10p starting rate wavered between the importance of getting people back to work and the importance of making work pay. When I was in the Treasury, it became apparent that the right hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown), who is now the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was indulging in a bidding exercise to ensure that at the election Labour had the lowest starting rate of tax. Subsequent analysis has been conducted to justify that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government's argument stresses the importance of getting people back to work we should examine the proposal's credentials. Paragraph 4.18 of the pre-Budget report entitled "The Modernisation of Britain's Tax and Benefits System: Number One" states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Reform must start with an analysis of the problems facing individuals trying to move into work."</p></blockquote>
The document helpfully publishes a table showing the results of a survey about what prevented people from leaving benefit. What reasons did people seeking to go back to work have for not going back to work? Thirty-five per cent, mentioned worries about wages being too
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
low; 32 per cent, mentioned the amount of council tax benefit; 31 per cent, mentioned losing housing benefit or mortgage help; 27 per cent, mentioned losing passported benefits; 21 per cent, mentioned the need to pay extra costs, such as work clothes and travel; 18 per cent, mentioned the cost of child care; 16 per cent, mentioned the need to repay loans and debts; and 26 per cent, mentioned worries about a job being temporary. I could go on. The pre-Budget document— the Government's own analysis—does not mention the starting rate of tax as an inhibitor to the process of returning to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Right hon. Gentleman accept that one reason why people might not mention the starting rate of tax is that people who are unemployed and on benefit would not have experience of it? The Government's proposals deal with the problems that he describes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady makes my case for me. The Government's own research suggests that people who have no experience of tax do not regard the 10p starting rate of tax as a key issue. My argument is not based on one piece of research—it is a composite of views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to develop my argument further. The suggestion that the Government's proposal is a back-to-work measure is questionable. The second line of argument that I want to pursue involves the complexity of the tax system. The hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) raises the question of how much people understand in this context. Other Committee members have touched on that matter, and I shall not develop the point in detail. In a document entitled "The IFS Green Budget", which was published in May 1997, the Institute for Fiscal Studies stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For simplicity in the tax system, an increase in allowances is better"—</p></blockquote>
than creating lower rates of tax—
	<br><blockquote><p>"because it moves those with the lowest income tax liabilities out of tax altogether."</p></blockquote>
People understand that at some stage they will have to deal with tax, and the more pounds that they can earn and keep without facing a tax bill may be an inducement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute for Fiscal Studies developed the argument further, in "Options for 1997: The Green Budget", which was published in October 1996. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What is clear is that a cut in the basic rate gives larger percentage gains to richer households. This is because it benefits only those who pay tax at or above the basic rate".</p></blockquote>
It develops its argument that allowances are a better way to reward people—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that study make any assessment of the work incentives generated by the working
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
families tax credit and the child care tax credit? The amount of money that people take home in their pay packets, balanced with their benefits, is what provides the incentive to work or not to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady will allow me, I shall come to the working families tax credit and certain changes in national insurance in a little while.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its 1996 green Budget submission, the Institute for Fiscal Studies also stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, extending personal allowances does give the largest 	<i>proportionate</i> gain of our three options to those at the bottom end of the income distribution."</p></blockquote>
The IFS has done a lot of work to show that people at the bottom of the income scale gained as a result of the reduction of the starting point for tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For brevity's sake, I shall now turn to the evidence, which builds on what the hon. Member for Northampton, North was saying. If the Government want to help people back into work, there are much better ways of spending the money that has been put to one side for the 10p tax rate. That analysis is supported by work undertaken by Mr. Paul Gregg of Her Majesty's Treasury and the centre for economic performance at the London school of economics, Mr. Paul Johnson of the Financial Services Authority and Mr. Howard Reed of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. They used a tax benefit calculation model that, according to Mr. Reed, is available to, and sometimes used by, the Treasury and they come to some startling conclusions about the effect in the first five to six years, not only of the 10p starting rate but of the working families tax credit and national insurance reforms. They estimate that 76,000 people will be induced to return to work, and that the cost of the 10p starting rate per job created will be a staggering £39,000. They contrast that with the working families tax credit, which will cost £8,300 per employee, and the national insurance reforms, which will cost £1,826 per employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that Labour Members—indeed, all hon. Members—genuinely want more people in work, but we must consider value for money. Although the exact nature of research findings can always be questioned, there can be no doubt that getting people back into work by means of the 10p starting rate is very expensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Casale 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wimbledon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has made the Conservative party's opposition to the 10p starting rate clear. He does not believe that it will be an incentive to work. Rather than putting the starting rate of tax down from 20p to 10p, his amendment would put it up from 20p to 23p. He wants to eliminate the starting rate altogether, so that the starting rate of tax, by implication, will be 23p. Can we assume that it is Conservative party policy to put up rates of income tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman knew me a little better, he would know that I would not immediately
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
fall into that trap. I want to redeploy the resources involved, as my closing remark will show.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled an amendment, which was not chosen for debate, that suggested that the matter should be referred to the National Audit Office to consider whether it was good value for money. I believe that it can be shown conclusively that it is bad value for money. I calculate, using the Treasury's own calculator, that if the amount of money set aside for the 10p starting rate and the change in the basic rate to 22p in 2000–01 were redeployed, £4.6 billion less than the cost of the 22p basic rate and the 10p starting rate combined—would be enough to introduce a £5,000 personal allowance. That would fulfil the objective of making work more attractive, and would give a good headline—I know that the Government like headlines—of the first £100 a week of earned income being tax free.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should have proposed a range of options to be evaluated for their effectiveness as a back-to-work measure. On the basis of analysis undertaken by, among others, someone who works for the Treasury, the conclusion has been drawn that the 10p starting rate is bad value for money in terms of the Government's stated objective of getting people back to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 19 meets the Government's commitment to bring in a new starting rate of income tax. It introduces a starting rate band of £1,500, which will be charged at 10 per cent.—the lowest rate for more than 35 years. The new starting rate of tax is part of a range of income tax and national insurance contributions measures designed to complement the national minimum wage by helping to make work pay, to encourage people into work and to ensure that they keep more of their earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with some of the issues raised by the right hon. Member for Fylde. He said that the table in the pre-Budget report did not mention the starting rate of tax as a reason for not going back to work. That argument is nonsensical. The first point in the list of disincentives that he read out was that wages were too low. Lowering the starting rate of tax will raise net wages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the IFS report, which states that the measures introduced by the Government, such as working families tax credit, national insurance contributions reform and the 10p starting rate, will help to move more people into work. This is a co-ordinated package that will help people in a range of circumstances. The 10p rate is designed to improve work incentives for people moving into work. It is also designed to help taxpayers already in work and on low pay by ensuring that they keep more of their earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 57, proposed by the right hon. Member for Fylde, is most interesting. Its effect would be to override the provisions charging the starting rate of income tax at 10 per cent. As we have said, the starting rate of 10 per cent, was one of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
Government's manifesto commitments. In any event, amendment No. 57 is unworkable. It would leave the income tax system with a lower rate band, for which no rate of tax had been set. It would also leave savings income below the basic rate limit subject to that same non-existent rate of tax, causing chaos for financial institutions paying interest to savers and giving those with the largest reserves of capital a windfall tax cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was shocked to find that the right hon. Gentlemen's amendment had been costed at £18 billion. He is a former Financial Secretary to the Treasury. I do not know what happens when Financial Secretaries give up their posts but, clearly, something odd happens. I shall make sure that I guard my future carefully because as soon as Financial Secretaries get away from Treasury chambers, absolute recklessness breaks out. We have seen the former Financial Secretary to the Treasury proposing, in all seriousness, amendments to the Finance Bill that would carry a price tag for the British taxpayer of £18 billion. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I would hear my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie), who takes an interest in the matter, asking me to repeat that, so I shall say again, £18 billion. I urge my hon. Friends to reject the amendment and to support clause 19.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can always tell that the Government have run out of intellectual fire when a Government Minister spends most of her reply commenting on the technical failings of an amendment. Had she listened, she would have known that it was a probing amendment to discover the alternative ways of deploying the money that the Government have put aside for both the 10p starting rate of tax and other measures in the Budget. If the Financial Secretary chooses to duck the issue of value for money, let me quote from the report that I mentioned in my previous remarks:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The 10p starting rate of Income Tax appears to be the least cost-effective reform, perhaps because it is not as well targeted on specific groups who are more likely to move into work as is the WFTC."</p></blockquote>
Upon those few sentences, my case rests that the Government are about to spend the public's money on a measure that is bad value for money in terms of getting people back to work. As 	<i>Hansard</i> will show, the Financial Secretary totally failed to answer my points about value for money, just as she failed earlier to answer the points raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood about charities and the 10p starting rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would increase personal allowances for those aged over 65—and, indeed, also for those aged over 75. Elsewhere, the Goverment's tax policy has discriminated against pensioners. As we have just heard, pensioners will not benefit from the 10p rate on savings, and we have heard in previous sittings how the dividend tax credit will be taken away from the poorest pensioners. The Government are pushing through a third tax change, which is not often mentioned, but is very important to my constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
National taxes are being held down and local taxes are being forced up. Local authorities do not receive the grant support they need, and must make up the difference in their budgets by increasing council tax, which hits pensioners hard. When council tax increases are way above inflation, people on fixed incomes are hit particularly hard. It is clear from the different tax measures that pensioners need compensation to protect diem from ever rising tax bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
These modest amendments are in line with the Government's suggestions in the Budget, but would take them a little further. That is necessary because of the various tax increases to which I have referred. Future pensioners will not receive the married couples allowance, and we gave muted support to that measure on the understanding that there would be compensating measures elsewhere in the Bill. Our amendments provide the Government with the opportunity properly to compensate pensioners affected by that and other measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would increase the personal allowances to older taxpayers by up to £220. That would not be a cost-effective way to providing more help to old people. Clause 21 already increases personal allowances by up to £200 more than would be required by statutory indexation, and I believe that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton gave the Government a couple of cheers for doing that. We have guaranteed that in 1999–2000 someone aged 65 to 74 can have an income of £110 a week before paying income tax, and someone aged 75 or older can have an income of £115 before paying income tax. Those increases allow pensioners to keep more of their income and, importantly, take about 100,000 pensioners on low incomes out of tax altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right to strike a balance, and I believe strongly that the amendment would make the balance wrong. Increases in tax allowances help pensioners only if they have incomes high enough to be taxable. About
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
two thirds of pensioners have incomes below the income tax threshold, and it is important mat they also receive help. That is why we introduced a minimum income guarantee for pensioners and linked the value of that guarantee to earnings rather than prices, and why we increased the winter allowance for pensioner households from £20 to £ 100.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton did not say so, but the amendments would carry a cost. For those who are interested, I can say that the additional cost would be about £90 million. The amendments would not succeed in providing a balanced package, and I urge my hon. Friends to reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed with the Minister's response. Does she not admit that phasing out the married couples allowance for future pensioners will drag in an extra £50 million, according to Library estimates, to the Treasury every year? That revenue is being taken from pensioners, so it would be reasonable to provide resources that go some way—I do not pretend that they would go the whole way—to protect pensioners from that tax increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not expect the Minister to accept the amendments, and I do not intend to press them to a vote, but I hope that she will reflect on the fact that they show how to compensate pensioners. I do not agree with her argument that because some pensioners have incomes below me income tax allowance, ours is not a targeted approach. I believe that it targets lower income pensioners better than the £100 winter fuel allowance. If we are interested in proper targeting and more effective use of resources, our suggestion is the way forward. As my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon explained to the House last night, an age-tiered pension is the simplest way of using resources to tackle pensioner poverty. None the less, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause and the amendments deal with the taxation of capital gains. The proposal is to align the rates of capital gains tax with the 20 per cent, and 40 per cent, rates that will apply to savings income. It is strange that the Government make a virtue of their 20 per cent, savings rate only when we debate the Finance Bill. We heard how the Chancellor's Budget speech and the Budget document—the Red Book—made no mention of the 20 per cent. rate. He announced rates of 10 per cent., 23 per cent, and 40 per cent., which we now know apply only to earned income. It is gratifying that the Government are coming clean in describing fully the 20 per cent, rate that will apply to a great deal of savings income, and with which the Chancellor intends to align the lowest capital gains tax rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change is a simplifying measure. We should welcome the fact that me sinner eventually repents. We criticised the enormous additional complexity created by last year's new capital gains tax system. Most of that complexity continues, including tapering relief, multiple rates for business and other assets, and the inherent unfairness in the system, especially for those who are approaching retirement. People who plan to retire in the next few years will still lose their anticipated retirement relief, and will not have time to build up tapering relief. An owner of a small business will be hit much harder than he anticipated, while the lucky beneficiary of the Goldman Sachs flotation will be able to hold on to his shares and pay a fraction of the capital gains tax that he would have owed. The Government have benefited the rich few at the expense of the less well-off many.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does nothing to correct much of the complexity and unfairness. Our amendments attempt to do that by tackling two issues. Although disabled individuals who hold assets in their own name will be taxable at the lower rate, trusts for the disabled remain taxable at 34 per cent. Most of the trusts are not established for tax avoidance purposes. The Government became obsessed with tax avoidance. No doubt the fact that the former Paymaster General was something of an expert affected Treasury thinking. He bequeathed a legacy of suspicion about anyone with trusts anywhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a clear distinction between trusts set up offshore for tax-avoidance purposes—with which we became familiar when the ex-Paymaster General's tax affairs were delved into—and those that are the subject of the amendment. Typically, such a trust is set up for an injured or disabled person after a court settlement. Given that the lower rate will be reduced from 23 per cent, to 20 per cent., it would be wrong for such a trust to continue to be hit with an effective capital gains tax rate of 34 per cent. Our amendment would deal with the widening of that gap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 119 would align capital gains tax rates with the 20 per cent, savings rate not merely—as the clause will—for individuals, but also in respect of
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
funds held by life assurance companies. The Government say that they want to encourage saving and long-term insurance of all kinds. They talk about getting people out off dependency on the state and encouraging them to build up assets on which they can rely in hard times and old age. However, the provision is another example of the Government failing to follow through the logic in the taxation of life assurance companies. There is a strong case for reducing the rate to 20 per cent, rather than maintaining the higher rate, which is something of an anomaly. In the interests of fairness and equality, I urge the Government to accept that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: shall say one or two words about amendment No. 120, which would undo many of the injustices created by the two Finance Acts put on the statute book since May 1997. It would deal with a particular injustice created by section 120 of the Finance Act 1998, which raised the rate of CGT applicable to trustees of a settlement from 23 per cent, to 34 per cent. That section will also apply to settlement trusts for disable people and to those in receipt of attendance allowance or disability living allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is highly unlikely that those who receive disability living allowance will face a rate of tax higher than the basic rate that would apply if the income were paid to them directly. Therefore it seems harsh to impose on them a 34 per cent, rate simply because—for good reason—the money is paid via a trust. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) said last year, many trusts exist for those on modest incomes. If it were not for their age or infirmity, the capital would go directly to the beneficiaries, who would be taxed at 23 per cent, or less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year's change was grossly unjust. The amendment would undo that injustice to a small extent by applying the new, low rate of CGT to the type of trust referred to in paragraph (1) (1) of schedule 1 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. The Act describes it as a trust in which settled property is held for a mentally disabled person, or a person in receipt of attendance allowance or the care component of disability living allowance at the middle or higher rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Last year's Finance Bill introduced a uniform rate of tax, currently 34 per cent., for the gains of all trusts. That produced a rational rate structure and made the charged CGT fairer by taxing gains at a rate that reflects the various rates that would have applied had the gains arisen directly to the beneficiaries of the trust or the estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would reintroduce a two-rate system by singling out for special treatment trusts for people with disabilities. That point gave rise to considerable discussion in last year's Finance Bill Standing Committee, of which I was a member. The Government made it clear that a two-tier system was not needed to cover such trusts, which are already
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
treated more favourably than other trusts under CGT rules. Committee members will be sympathetic to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
