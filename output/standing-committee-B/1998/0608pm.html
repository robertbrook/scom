	<p>	<i>Question proposed this day,</i> That this schedule be the Tenth schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned, I was responding to the questions of the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) on pension scheme members who wished to rebuild their benefit entitlements following a divorce or pension-sharing arrangement. I explained that no specific legislation was needed to implement the easement for moderate earners who will be able to rebuild their pension benefit entitlements without taking account of the pension debit that has given effect to the pension sharing. Most occupational pension schemes choose the discretionary tax approval route, which offers more generous terms. Schemes that need approval under the strict criteria in section 590 of the Taxes Act 1988 relate primarily to controlling directors of companies such as investment companies, where the Inland Revenue would not be prepared to exercise its discretionary approval powers. In any event, controlling directors are excluded from the easement. The fact that it is not given statutory force in schedule 10 does not undermine its impact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire also asked why schedule 10 made no provision to give effect to an easement for holders of personal pensions and retirement annuity contracts—[	<i>Interruption</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sarwar) must take his seat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Butterfill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The easement relates to occupational pension schemes that are approved under the discretionary powers which are controlled by the limits on benefits and the contributions that an employee may pay. Personal pensions and retirement annuity contracts are controlled solely by the limits on contributions. For example, the contribution limit for older people in a personal pension rises to 40 per cent of capped earnings, whereas the limit for someone with a retirement annuity contract rises to 27½ per cent of uncapped earnings. Those limits should provide ample scope for most people to make extra contributions to rebuild their benefit entitlement because very few people pay anywhere near the maximum contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not think that it is right in principle to create special tax reliefs for extra contributions that are made by pension sharers. That would be unfair to other
	<span class='label label-info column'>520</span>
scheme members, including those who are married and stay married, and those who divorce but do not pension share and are unable to pay the extra tax relieved contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire also asked why we limited the easement to people on moderate earnings, for whom the threshold is £22,650 a year. We think that it is right, especially in the case of additional tax relief, to help people with modest earnings. They most need help with their savings and that is where we want to target the tax relief. The proposed threshold, which is a quarter of the current limit for the earnings on which benefits can be accrued in an occupational pension scheme, will cover the majority of occupational pension scheme members. It will target help to those who need it most. The threshold will be linked to the normal rules for people who change jobs and are able to ignore pension benefits from earlier employment. If the threshold for the latter changes, it will extend automatically to pension sharers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire also asked whether scheme members should be allowed fully to rebuild their lost pension rights. We do not believe that that would be right, for the two reasons that I gave: First, that the help should be concentrated on the less well off; and, secondly, that it would be wrong to give greater pension tax reliefs across the board to people who divorce and then pension-share, as distinct from those who divorce and do not pension-share or those who stay married.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point raised by the hon. Gentleman was whether there should be a limit on the additional pension that the ex-spouse can earn, in either the same or a subsequent pension scheme. There was a suggestion that, as there would be some limits on the scheme member to rebuild his pension rights after a divorce and pension-sharing, there should be equivalent limits on the ex-spouse. I believe that that is wrong. The ex-spouse will take a share of the pension, in the form of a pension credit or a pension share, from which she—it will generally be the woman—would otherwise have benefited, had she remained a wife or subsequently become a widow. The benefit to which she is entitled from her husband's pension is separate from any pension that she has earned, or might earn in future, from her own employment. It would therefore be unfair to count the shared pension that she received following a divorce against any other pension that she had earned, or might earn in the future, from her own employment. Any restriction on the ex-spouse's pension could result in a fair financial settlement being thwarted, and unjustly affect any pension based on her own employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have responded to the questions raised by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire. Schedule 10 gives effect in the tax regulations to the pension-sharing provisions of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill. The hon. Gentleman began this morning's debate by saying that he welcomed the provisions and I, in turn, welcomed his support for them. However, I am now advised that there has been a policy change on the part of the official Opposition.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>521</span>
During the Committee stage of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill, they opposed the pension-sharing clauses. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) was called a mad feminist for supporting the pension-sharing arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that the official Opposition have had a change of heart—better late than never. I welcome the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire to the ranks of the mad feminists, if that is what our support for pension-sharing on divorce makes us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Hertfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that when I was a Minister with responsibility for pensions, I supervised the preparation of a Green Paper and a White Paper on this matter. Those led to a draft Bill that led to the provisions in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill. She must not fall into the trap of thinking that because the official Opposition questions the detail of a proposal, they oppose the broad principle. I have always welcomed the principle of pension sharing and I always will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>ACQUISITIONS DISREGARDED UNDER INSURANCE COMPANIES CONCESSION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Whittingdale 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Maldon and East Chelmsford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee for too long, but I want to raise one or two points with the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause concerns the taxation of transfers within groups of insurance companies. Since 1968, the Inland Revenue has permitted intra-group transfers through non-statutory arrangement for computing and making returns of profits, so that they do not become taxable until the asset leaves the group. In 1995, it was proposed that the Revenue might drop that concession. In December 1998, the proposal was suddenly resurrected, and a notice was issued stating that the concession would be withdrawn from 1 January 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why did the Government change their mind and decide to withdraw the concession? Why was the change, which came as something of a surprise to the industry, made at very short notice and with no warning? Having said that, I am not particularly opposed to the removal of the concession. Certainly, the industry has not expressed unhappiness about the proposal. Nevertheless, I should be interested to hear
	<span class='label label-info column'>522</span>
the Economic Secretary's response to my observations on the change's impact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will introduce transitional provisions, which will benefit recently merged insurance companies in particular. When insurance companies merge, a large number of transfers within the merged company is likely in order to reorganise the newly created group's assets and liabilities. I suppose that the transitional provisions are directed towards providing assistance to companies that have merged in that way. Clearly, a great deal of activity is taking place in the insurance industry, where there has been a number of such mergers. The removal of the concession might inhibit future mergers, because the existing, non-statutory arrangement, through which insurance companies are not charged for intra-group transfers, will no longer apply. That change might add to the costs associated with mergers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, we do not particularly wish to oppose the clause, but I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would deal with those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) said, the clause deals with the ending of arrangements made through non-statutory provisions in respect of certain profits resulting from intra-group transfers. I am intrigued as to why the original non-statutory arrangements have run out of steam. What characteristic of the existing arrangements prevented the Revenue from taxing that which it now wants to tax? I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would clarify that point, because it raises the wider question on which my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) touched during an earlier debate, when he probed Ministers on how the law deals with extra-statutory concessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the further issue of the strength and breadth of extra-statutory concessions, which are usually narrowly defined to deal with particular areas of uncertainty on the management of tax legislation. Clearly, given that the law is to be changed in a more robust fashion, a greater burden was placed on them than was originally planned. Will the operation of other extra-statutory concessions be reviewed? In the light of changes in the insurance industry to which my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford referred, those concessions may be subjected to a testing experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to explain why we are giving statutory backing to the orderly unwinding of an extra-statutory concession that dates back to 1967. There are several reasons why the extra-statutory concession is no longer appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the arrangements that, in some respects, treat companies within a single group as if they were one company—for administrative purposes—are incompatible with the obligations that are imposed under corporation tax self-assessment. Secondly, corporation tax self-assessment means that, from the point of view of the Inland Revenue, there is no longer any great administrative benefit to be gained from the simplification, which was one of the reasons for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0299">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>523</span>
providing the extra-statutory concession in the first place. Thirdly, since the end of March 1996, paragraph 12 of schedule 9 of the Finance Act 1996 has allowed no-gain no-loss intra-group transfers of loan relationship assets. A significant part of the extra-statutory concession is therefore redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, concern has been expressed about the response of some groups to the arrangements. There is no doubt that they provide tax planning opportunities that are not permitted by statute or by case law generally, and are not available to other large commercial groups. As the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) indicated, non-statutory arrangements of this kind, especially when they apply widely, are open to justifiable criticism for undermining Parliament's authority over the taxation system. It was therefore judged no longer appropriate to maintain in the system a basis for taxation for which there was no statutory cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of the arrangements for notifying insurance companies, the transitional provisions recognise the need for an orderly unwinding of the concession. They allow for tax-free intra-group transfer to continue until the end of December 1999. Insurers will therefore be able to reorganise their business this year. The insurance companies affected—only a limited number of groups are concerned—were notified of the Revenue's decision to withdraw the arrangement before the change was made. As indicated, transitional arrangements are being offered to deal with the difficulties that might arise from the change to a statutory basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Inland Revenue is in discussion with the Association of British Insurers—the trade body for the industry—on an orderly ending. Large amounts are involved, and the Government were worried that companies might try to argue, in relation to obligations in respect of earlier years when the extra-statutory concession was in force, that the undertaking to return the tax on profits no longer applied. Because the amounts involved are large, we felt it right to underpin, with a statutory provision, the undertakings that the groups have already given to pay the appropriate tax on profits on intra-group transfers when the assets are transferred out of the group. That provision will require companies to return their profits on investment on the basis of the original group cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all that the clause does. It is long and complicated because the interaction between the arrangement and recent legislation—for instance, on loan relationships and the foreign exchange gains rule—is complicated. If companies abide by the undertakings that they gave in the past, however, there will be no need whatever to examine the legislation in great detail. I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>LLOYD'S: MEMBERS' AGENT POOLING ARRANGEMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, this clause need not delay us unduly, but I want to raise one particular point with the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the clause is to simplify the taxation of members' agent pooling arrangements at Lloyd's. As I understand it, MAPAs enable members of Lloyd's to participate in a range of syndicates through a pooling arrangement. When a member of Lloyd's underwrites through the mechanism of a MAPA, in effect, the member participates in a share of each of the syndicates supported by that MAPA. In theory, each time that the MAPA acquires or disposes of capacity within an individual syndicate, there is a possible tax charge on each individual member of the MAPA. Similarly, if someone joins or leaves the MAPA, that, too, can have tax implications for all members. The purpose of the clause is, therefore, to remove the huge administrative burden of having to track every single such movement so that individual members do not have to make a declaration every time something of that nature occurs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is certainly welcome. It has come about as a result of discussions between Lloyd's and the Inland Revenue. I know that Lloyd's welcomes the fact that the Government have recognised its concerns in the clause. However, the clause deals only with the taxation of individuals who participate in MAPAs, directly or through a Scottish limited partnership; it does not deal with the tax position of companies that participate in MAPAs. Members of Lloyd's are concerned that companies may still be subject to the kind of tax charges that I have described and that the agents administering the MAPAs will still have to make the same analysis and track each change that takes place in order to provide the information required for the tax arrangements of corporate members of MAPAs. If that is the case, the reduction in the burden on agents is largely removed because they will still have to make many of the administrative arrangements that they already have to make for individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that Lloyd's has already raised the issue with the Inland Revenue, which has been sympathetic to its concerns. However, this might provide an opportunity for the Financial Secretary to say a little more about that specific concern raised by Lloyd's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for explaining the clause's purpose so admirably. Corporate members of Lloyd's do not pay capital gains tax on the sale of syndicate rights. Separate legislation in the Finance Act 1994 ensures that, in relation to corporate members of Lloyd's, all profits arising from assets employed in their underwriting business are brought into account under case 1 of schedule D, so they are dealt with separately. Very few corporate members of Lloyd's participate in syndicates through MAPAs, and because their profits are not computed in the same way as those of individuals, this legislation could not appropriately be extended to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>525</span>
cover them. However, the Inland Revenue is keeping the position under review and discussing possible options with Lloyd's. We are mindful of the situation and continuing to examine it, but it would not be appropriate to deal with it through the provisions of clause 73. I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Clauses 76 to 78 were published in draft form in December 1998 and made available for consultation with a draft statement of practice. Feedback was provided by most professional bodies and industry, but only minor amendments were made, despite extensive comments, especially from the Law Society and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. The Government angered both bodies because of the way in which they handled the consultation process and ignored most of their valid comments. The Institute of Chartered Accountants said in its representations:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Whilst we note that our point in relation to fraudulent or negligent conduct was taken … we are disappointed to see that the other points were not taken. We believe that most of these points are still relevant … We remain concerned that the APA system as set out in this clause and the accompanying draft statement of practice are not sufficiently attractive to encourage taxpayers to make an application."</p></blockquote>
The Law Society also expressed dismay and stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We submitted detailed comments to the Inland Revenue on the draft legislation and draft Statement of Practice … Although two minor recommendations which we made were adopted in the clause contained in the Finance Bill, we are concerned that the others … were not. These are all important points, and we are surprised that we have received no response from the Inland Revenue on them, and that the outcome of the consultation … has not been published contemporaneously with the Bill. We question the value of the consultation process when, after considerable time and effort has been voluntarily spent by busy and experienced practitioners"—</p></blockquote>

	<br><blockquote><p>"there appears to be a reluctance on the part of those responsible for preparing it to make amendments to what is initially proposed."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>526</span>
This is not the first time during our proceedings that we have heard that complaint from outside bodies who have spent time making representations to the Government. This legislation runs to some four pages and the statement of practice runs to some nine pages and 46 paragraphs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a perception that the Inland Revenue is not enthusiastic about the advance pricing arrangements and that that is why the rules are so restrictive. I cite in evidence paragraph 12 of the statement of practice:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Potential applicants need to bear in mind that the process is designed to offer assistance in resolving complex transfer pricing issues. The Inland Revenue does not regard entering into APAs on less complex matters as a sensible use of resources in the absence of significant doubt as to the manner in which the arm's length principle should be applied. It may therefore decline to accept applications that do not satisfy those criteria."</p></blockquote>
Amendments Nos. 190 and 191 are relatively simple and would replace "provisions" with "rules" to distinguish between references to "provisions" in the advance pricing agreements and in the transfer pricing legislation. At the moment, "provisions" is used to described both, and that causes confusion. The Law Society gave an example when it stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it appears that in clauses 76(1)(c) and (3) the references to 'provisions' are to 'statutory provisions', but clause 76(4), whilst referring, it seems, to 'provisions' in that sense, also cross-refers to clause 76(2)(d) and (e) where 'provision' is used in the sense in which it is used in paragraph 1(1)(a) of Schedule 28AA."</p></blockquote>
After that helpful example, the society stated
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is most unhelpful that these defects in the draft legislation"</p></blockquote>
were not corrected before the sill was published, particularly as representations were made during the consultation process.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, the purpose of clauses 76 to 78 is to provide for advance pricing agreements between businesses and the Inland Revenue. Advance pricing agreements enable complex transfer pricing issues affecting multinational businesses to be resolved on a prospective basis. When an agreement is reached, the business enjoys the certainty that, if its transfer prices in transactions involving associated businesses follow the agreement, they will be accepted by the Inland Revenue as satisfying the arm's length standard. That reduces costs for businesses and the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is broad international agreement that the arm's length standard represents a fair way of arriving at transfer prices for tax purposes. Under that standard, a price charged between associated businesses should be equivalent to the price that would have been charged between independent businesses acting at arm's length. The provisions follow on from the modernisation of the transfer pricing rules in the Finance Act 1998. As the hon. Gentleman said, the draft legislation has been subject to consultation by the Inland Revenue.

	<span class='label label-info column'>527</span>
I was disappointed that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton gave such a negative view of the reception of the proposals. The Law Society made a number of points, which are the subject of amendments and which I hope to deal with this afternoon. All accountancy bodies welcomed the response document published in May 1999 and the business community welcomed the introduction of a statutory basis for advance pricing agreements. A number of detailed comments have been made, many of which relate to the detailed way in which agreements will be negotiated and applied in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the provisions have been enacted, the Inland Revenue will issue a statement of practice, the terms of which have also been subject to consultation. We are still taking comments on the statement of practice to ensure that we have taken account of as many points as possible. I was not aware of the anger of the Law Society, but I certainly know that it raised some points which the Inland Revenue did not agree were necessary. Amendments Nos. 190 and 191 revolve around one such principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, "provision" can be used in a number of different ways. For example, it could refer to a legislative provision, provision of a transaction, or an accounting provision against future liability. The amendment would change "provision" to "rules". The Government acted in good faith and took the advice of parliamentary counsel on the change. The Law Society is an august body and greatly respected, but it is important that the Government also take note of parliamentary counsel's advice. That advice, given to the Government by those who drafted the Bill, is that the appropriate term has been used—that is, "provision". To use the term "rules" instead, at this point in the Bill, would make nonsense of the development of the transfer pricing provisions. Parliamentary counsel's advice is that we have used the correct term. We understand the point that the Law Society has made, and we have explained our reasons. Any change would further confuse the already complicated arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to have consultations and to listen to the points raised, but when parliamentary counsel tell us that our legislation is correctly drafted and that any change would undermine it, we shall follow their advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following closely the line of argument on this matter and I am interested in the strength of support that the Paymaster General is giving to parliamentary counsel. Earlier in our proceedings, there was implied criticism of the previous work of the same parliamentary counsel—who are always anonymous—in relation to some of the legislation that has had to be—let us say—fixed. Can we therefore infer that the Paymaster General will adopt a benign attitude towards any further retrospective references to parliamentary counsel that we may be forced to make?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a nice try. I think that the right hon. Gentleman would agree, as he once held the post of Financial Secretary to the Treasury, that a great deal of notice is taken during consultation
	<span class='label label-info column'>528</span>
processes and, although parliamentary counsel are not totally infallible, their advice on this matter is clear. I have put on record that, on this occasion, parliamentary counsel are right. That is why the Government are asking the Committee to reject the amendment if it is pressed to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The word "rules" is already used by the Paymaster General's own parliamentary counsel in clauses 76(4) and 78(1)(b). It is not valid to say that use of the word "rules" in these provisions would add to the confusion. Its use would have reduced confusion. It is a pity that the Government have taken the wrong decision on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster General is wrong to say that there is no anger about the provisions. She has read the representations from the Law Society, and it is clear from the tone of its introduction to clause 76 that it is angry that its representations to the consultation process have been ignored. She is also wrong to say that the Opposition do not welcome the advance pricing agreements. We welcome the concept, but problems arise in the detail of the way in which the arrangements have been structured. Those details could create severe problems for putting into practice the advance pricing agreements. However, as we have aired the subject quite liberally, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 192, in page 47, line 34, after 'attribution' insert

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 192 deals with another concern raised by the Law Society—that the phrase, "permanent establishment" in clause 76(2)(b) is not defined in the Taxes Act. It is a term used in most double taxation treaties, and either it needs to be defined or specific reference needs to be made to the fact that it should be used and interpreted in the same way as the phrase used in the double taxation agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 192 takes the latter approach and, after the word "attribution" in clause 76(2)(b), adds the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"in accordance with the provisions of any double taxation arrangements having effect by virtue of section 788 of the Taxes Acts,",</p></blockquote>
which is the section that incorporates into UK tax law the effects of our agreements with other countries under double taxation treaties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 196 reflects the widespread criticism that the advance pricing procedure can be used only for transfer pricing purposes and not for other legislative requirements in respect of market value, such as the thin capitalisation rules in section 209 of the Taxes Act, which require the interest rate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>529</span>
between connected parties to be set at the market value. The Chartered Institute of Taxation asked the Paymaster General to confirm whether subsection 2(d) will allow companies to deal with thin capitalisation and issues relating to capital allowances and capital gains. It would be helpful if she could provide that confirmation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society also questioned whether the advance pricing procedure could be used in case law, where transfers of trading stock have to be made at market value. Will people who regularly face complex issues associated with the transfer of trading stock be able to make use of advance pricing agreements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Dorrell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Charnwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise in support of the amendments moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. I strongly support the principle of advance pricing agreements, but the Paymaster General should realise that, in highlighting the Government's unwillingness to respond to points made during consultation, my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is not making—as he sometimes does—provocative, party political points. He is simply putting on record the atmosphere among those whose advice and expertise the Government sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton during consideration of the previous group of amendments were right, but I did not intervene on his behalf because they presented the Committee with a choice between the expertise of the Law Society and that of parliamentary counsel. That is not a dispute on which I would seek to offer advice, because it might return to haunt me. However, the amendment raises a much simpler issue, which does not require us to compare advice given by two groups of experts. The Government's own explanatory notes state that, "in practice", subsection 2(b) will apply
	<br><blockquote><p>"where there is a double taxation agreement between the UK and the foreign country."</p></blockquote>
The explanatory notes make the same point in reverse in respect of subsection 2(a), which, "in practice", will apply
	<br><blockquote><p>"where there is no double taxation agreement between the UK and the foreign country."</p></blockquote>
I have read the clause carefully and can find no reference to the presence or absence of a double taxation treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would clarify the clause's wording in a manner that is in line with the explanatory notes, and I hope that the Paymaster General will respond to it on that basis. No doubt she will have arguments aplenty from parliamentary counsel as to why the drafting is inadequate. Why will subsection 2(a) apply in cases where there is no double taxation treaty, whereas subsection 2(b) will apply in cases where there is a double taxation treaty? That is important. If the Paymaster General cannot confine the circumstances in which the paragraphs apply, she opens herself to the charge that arises from subsections (3) and (4), that
	<span class='label label-info column'>530</span>
this Bill is widely drafted. The explanatory notes try to confine the clause to a set of circumstances that relate to the application of double taxation principles, but if she cannot explain where that is written in legislation, I do not understand why the effect should be confined in the way that she describes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would make two basic changes. Amendment No. 192 would introduce the phrase "permanent establishment", which is used in double taxation treaties and section 788 of the Taxes Act. It is a standard term in international double taxation treaties, but is not generally used in domestic legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of clause 76 is to use the term "permanent establishment" in the way that it is used in such treaties. However, the parliamentary draftsmen decided that it was neither necessary nor advisable to import such a definition into the Bill. It would make the implementation of the clause complex and would further complicate a measure that will provide certainty for companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will be able to agree with companies the provisions in clause 76, which were previously agreed only in double taxation treaties. Like the previous Government, we have used the model recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The definition of "permanent establishment" is set out in article 5 subsection (2) of that model treaty. However, article 5 subsections (3) and (4) contain elements that are variable on negotiation of each double taxation treaty. For example, article 5 subsection (3) refers to a building site, construction or installation project as constituting a permanent establishment. The recommendation is that it should last more than 12 months. However, that period can be varied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not every double taxation treaty uses permanent establishment in the same way. Article 5 subsection (4) sets out exceptions. The technical detail—the wording—of those exceptions can vary. To cross-reference "permanent establishment" in the way that has been suggested, we would have to refer to every variation in every double taxation treaty because of the different interpretations. That would be inappropriate and complex and would require substantial legislation, which would not enable us to achieve the, purpose of clause 76. The clause provides for an agreement to be made on a voluntary basis between the Inland Revenue and a company with regard to transfer pricing. On that basis, although I can see the logic and the attraction of the amendment, it would make it far more difficult to draft the legislation, let alone reach the necessary agreements
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton quoted clause 76(2)(b). The phrase "permanent establishment" is a term used in tax treaties. Clause 76(2)(b) refers only to where a tax treaty is in place because we do not have tax treaties with every single country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just stated that subsection 2(b) applies only where a double taxation

	<span class='label label-info column'>531</span>
treaty is in place, but that is not what the subsection says. It says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the attribution of income to any permanent establishment of the taxpayer (wherever situated) through which he has been carrying on, or is proposing to carry on, any business."</p></blockquote>
There is no reference to a tax treaty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The existence of agreements at the present time for transfer pricing is achievable only through taxation treaties. [HON. MEMBERS: "NO."] I am sorry, I shall correct myself before the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) does. The negotiations currently taking place are between the Inland Revenue and other countries. We are seeking to provide for negotiations on a voluntary agreement with companies. That is the provision in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 76(2)(b) applies where there is a permanent establishment. The term is used in double taxation treaties. It is relevant, therefore, only where there is a treaty. Clause 76(2)(a) applies where there is an agreement but no double taxation treaty. The two circumstances are explained. The law does not need to be mentioned in this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Paymaster General said was interesting, but I cannot believe that she meant to say it. She said that clause 76(2)(b) refers to a permanent establishment, which it certainly does, and she went on to say that "permanent establishment" is a term used in double taxation treaties. She then drew the conclusion that because the phrase is used in the clause and because it is used in double taxation treaties, the whole clause can work only in the context of double taxation treaties. I do not see that that follows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is right to correct me if I misled him in that way. If I said that the clause could work only in the context of double taxation treaties, I was clearly misleading him and I apologise to him and to the Committee. That was not what I meant. The clause provides for an agreement to be reached between the Inland Revenue and a multinational company on a voluntary basis. I have explained why cross-referencing the variation in every double taxation treaty would produce a much more complicated and difficult piece of legislation, which could be misused. The purpose of the clause is for voluntary agreements to be made between the Inland Revenue and the companies concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 196 raises concerns about the application of the arm's-length principle in areas other than transfer pricing. Concern has been expressed that even though an arm's length price has been agreed— for transfer pricing purposes—under an advance arrangement, the Revenue might seek to apply a different price to the same transaction for other purposes. That will not be the case. The Revenue will make that clear in a statement of practice, which will be issued when the provisions have been enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point concerns the commercial nature of the transaction. The principle of advance pricing arrangements is to establish a method for determining an arm's length price; it is not to establish whether or not the transaction is commercial, those Other tax provisions, such as those to counter tax avoidance
	<span class='label label-info column'>532</span>
through non-commercial transactions, will continue to apply. If Conservative Members are suggesting that the legislation should provide some kind of ruling on whether arrangements are commercial or not, that is not the intention behind the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 76 can apply whether or not there is a treaty. Subsection (2)(a) applies where there is not a treaty, and subsection (2)(b)—because of the reference to "permanent establishment"—applies where there is a treaty. That should deal with all of the points raised by Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 76(3) appears to say that the law envisages that an advance pricing agreement could produce a result different from what would have happened had the arrangement been governed by law. As well as having constitutional implications, that could risk the availability of double tax relief to a company overseas, as the tax would not be payable in accordance with general UK tax law. I look forward to hearing the Paymaster General's response to that idea. I also look forward to the Government's response to amendment No. 193, which is straightforward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with amendments Nos. 194 and 195. When an agreement is reached under clause 76, and a business complies with the relevant terms, the business will want certainty that it can rely on the transfer pricing arrived at by applying the agreement. The mechanism for achieving that is to displace the price that would otherwise have applied under other legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the use of the term "conclusively determined"—I understand that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is trying to build additional security into the clause—the amendment could reduce the certainty supplied by the clause. It could be interpreted to mean that the provisions outside the agreement still apply, but that the final interpretation of how they apply will be made
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>533</span>
according to the agreement. That is not the Government's intention, and it would give business less certainty than it will enjoy under the Bill, which is clear cut—the agreement displaces other agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under amendment No. 193, the Opposition would remove the requirement for the effect of the existing tax provisions in respect of which clarification is sought to be identified in an agreement. That requirement is an essential link between the advance pricing agreement and the transfer pricing rules. Without such a link, the agreement could not be governed by the existing transfer pricing rules. The removal of that obligation would lessen the certainty provided by clause 76. Therefore I hope that the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will not press that amendment, which may have been a probing one, to a Division. If he did so, I would ask my hon. Friends to resist it for those reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Paymaster General a simple question about subsection (5). Under that subsection, in cases such as those set out in subsection (2)(c), which involve
	<br><blockquote><p>"income which has arisen or may arise … for any purpose … outside the United Kingdom",</p></blockquote>
the taxpayer is required to explain what his position would be in the absence of an advance pricing agreement. That is an extraordinary provision. I should like to know why the taxpayer must state in the APA his understanding of his position in the absence of an APA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Paymaster General confirm, in the interests of certainty, whether the definitions of advance pricing agreements in a double taxation treaty can be relied on if an advance pricing agreement exists for transfer pricing between the United Kingdom and a company in a country which has a double taxation treaty? If there is no such double taxation treaty, and therefore there are no such definitions, does not the Paymaster General think it wise that some should be included in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have explained the difference between subsections (2)(a) and (2)(b). Subsection (2)(a) uses definitions for domestic matters—that is, branch income. Subsection (2)(b) defines the term "permanent establishment" where a double taxation treaty is in place. The purpose is to seek a voluntary agreement with a company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 76 has been the subject of consultation. Some respondents asked whether subsection (5)(a)
	<span class='label label-info column'>534</span>
required a business seeking an advance pricing agreement to provide an interpretation of the application of the relevant transfer pricing provisions. They said that that could prove difficult, and the purpose of the agreement was to provide clarity about something that was difficult to apply in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not what is intended in subsection (5)(a), which requires applicants to set out how the relevant provisions affect their businesses. That might involve, for example, saying why the transfer pricing provisions were relevant because of a transaction between enterprises associated with each other. Those rules require the application of the arm's-length principle; they do not go so far as to require an interpretation of how the transfer pricing rules should be applied. That point will be made clear in the statement of practice that will be issued by the Inland Revenue after the provisions have been enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an attempt to give some clarity concerning voluntary agreements between the Inland Revenue and multinational companies. The basis on which those will be arranged will be clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the basis in law and justice of the principle that allows an advance pricing agreement to affect the tax position of a third party?

the party who is not a signatory to the APA—
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the assumption that any question … is to be determined … by reference to the agreement"—</p></blockquote>

Clause 78 is a backstop provision to ensure that a company that is not a party to an APA is not prejudiced by the application of the agreement. Where a transfer price involving one company has been established under the terms of the APA, another company involved in the transaction can choose to use either the price established by the agreement or the price that would result from the transfer pricing laws in the absence of the agreement.

	<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) Subsection (1) above shall only apply when the Board is able to demonstrate that the company has deliberately or recklessly failed to comply with its payment obligations.'.</p></blockquote>
The clause relates to quarterly accounting and the taxation of company profits. The quarterly accounting regime has been previously discussed, and although it will not come into effect until 1 July 1999, it will be a substantial revenue raiser for the Government. The cut in the nominal rate of corporation tax does not represent a real cut in taxation for many companies, because it is more than offset by the many billions of pounds in overall payments that will result from the quarterly accounting provisions passed in previous Finance Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several companies are worried that the calculation of profits on quarterly accounts will be based not on actual profits in previous years but on an estimate of profits in the current year, which is notoriously difficult to calculate. Anyone who has been in business knows that it is difficult at the start of a financial year, or before a financial year has begun, to calculate, or estimate, accurately how it may end. There may be an unexpected capital gain, for example, towards the end of an accounting period, which would throw a budget out completely. If a company had in good faith estimated its tax payments on the basis that it would not receive any unexpected capital gains, it would resent the Inland Revenue's suggesting that tax had been deliberately underpaid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alarm has been raised by the clause, which will give the Inland Revenue new powers to investigate in this area of taxation, to obtain books, records and accounts, and to fine companies that do not seem to be complying with their tax payment obligations. The danger is that the Inland Revenue might be tempted to impose its own rather subjective views on tax that should have been paid on account, or to go on fishing expeditions to obtain the information for other purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would put into statute what I think the Minister believes to be the Government's intention—that the powers should not be used against a company unless there are signs that it has deliberately or recklessly failed to comply with its
	<span class='label label-info column'>536</span>
obligations, or has fraudulently or negligently made a claim for repayment. That is not in the Bill as drafted, under which arbitrary powers are given to the Inland Revenue. Although it may be the intention that those powers will be circumscribed by a guidance note in due course, it would be good if the Committee were to specify in the Bill, in order to reassure companies, that the powers will not be used against them unless they have deliberately or recklessly failed to comply with their obligations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much of the language that my right hon. Friend used in introducing the amendment has the same ring as some of the questions asked about Revenue powers and their operation when self-assessment for the individual was introduced. He is right to probe the possibility of Revenue fishing expeditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendment, because if nothing else, it will enable the Financial Secretary to explain—fully and in public, I hope—a little more about how the Revenue plans to use the powers that it will have under the clause, which my right hon. Friend wants to amend. Anxieties have been expressed about how those powers can be operated. I am intrigued, because the clause applies only to relatively large companies, which, by and large, are sophisticated operations that maintain good relationships with the Revenue because that is in the nature of their business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Often the Revenue will have regular meetings with such companies' accountants because that eases the way in which the tax system operates. Why, when such relative cordiality exists at the top end of the tax network, do we need the powers that the clause provides? I understand that the Revenue is always interested in fail-safe mechanisms—hence the powers that it wants to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend is right to try to include some restraints, which will force the Revenue to demonstrate that there is a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in the clause gives us a clear understanding of how the powers will operate. I was intrigued by the word "indications", in paragraph 14 of the explanatory notes, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Inland Revenue will seek to use these information powers only where there are indications that a company has deliberately or recklessly failed".</p></blockquote>
I appreciate that those words are not in the statute, but I am intrigued as to how the Revenue will define "indications". It will be required to be evermore probing of either the accountants or the companies to see whether the indications are based on fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A company may decide, on a quarterly basis, to set certain one-off charges against tax. Sadly, a large number of people may have been made redundant, causing a major payment to be made in a particular quarter. The company could decide that it was appropriate to set those payments against the tax liability in that quarter, to help its cash flow, so there would be a substantial drop in the declared level of tax for that quarter. A suspicious mind would be alerted. The Revenue has systems for comparing previous quarterly figures, and it would be alerted to a change in the pattern of tax declared when the system was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>537</span>
under way. The Revenue will say, "Hang on a minute. Last quarter you declared £100 million in profits, but this quarter it is £15 million".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will that be an indication? I do not know. I am not sure from what has been said so far how the Revenue will prosecute its inquiries to see whether what has happened is an indication of an entirely legitimate commercial transaction, or whether it is the tip of the iceberg of more nefarious activities. We should be told a little more about how the indications will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment says that the provisions in subsection (1) will apply only
	<br><blockquote><p>"when the Board is able to demonstrate that the company has deliberately or recklessly failed to comply with its payment obligations.".</p></blockquote>
That is an interesting point. There is an obligation to pay tax on time, and there is the question of declaring the correct level of profit on which the tax will be levied. Again, there are interesting questions about how to determine obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall stop speaking now, because we are at the beginning of an interesting probing exercise, and I look forward to the Financial Secretary's first response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) is the architect of self-assessment, I should have thought that he would have some appreciation for the clause. I was slightly—just a tetch, or perhaps a tad—disappointed that he did not give it his full approval. I am not sure what Opposition Members hope to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply concerned, Mr. Butterfill, by the new terminology being used in Committee. We have heard the term "fixing it"; now we are hearing "a tetch" and "a tad". It would be helpful for us to have a glossary of terms to refer to, so that we can know when we really have offended. We must know where certain words come on the annoyance Richter scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am so pleased that the right hon. Gentleman raised that point. Annoyed—moi? I am amazed at the excitement with which Opposition Members greeted our new technical term—"fix". I use the word either in its modern sense, meaning "to arrange an appointment", or in the 18th century sense of someone "fixing his interest". However, "fixing" clearly has a different meaning for Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure what Opposition Members hope to achieve with the amendment. It would prevent the Inland Revenue from imposing a penalty on a company that failed to provide the information requested under the instalment payment regulations, unless it could establish that the company had deliberately or recklessly failed to comply with its payment obligations. My answer to the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) is that the purpose of requesting such information is precisely to
	<span class='label label-info column'>538</span>
enable the Inland Revenue to establish whether a company has failed to comply in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without the relevant information, the Inland Revenue would find it difficult to establish whether the company's failure was deliberate or reckless. The penalty is to ensure that the Revenue has a sanction with which to enforce compliance. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman would agree that to ensure compliance, there must ultimately be a sanction. Otherwise, compliant companies that provided the information requested would be at a disadvantage compared with non-compliant companies that chose not to provide it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The information and penalty powers in the instalment payment regulations were the subject of extensive consultation with companies, their advisers and their representative bodies, which is clearly what would be expected of the Government. The Inland Revenue has claimed that the powers are not for routine use, and will be relied on only when there are indications of serious breach of the instalment payment regulations. As the right hon. Member for Fylde said, such powers are of interest only to the 20,000 or so large companies that are due to pay their corporation tax by instalments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Gentleman rightly said, such companies have a well-established relationship with the Revenue and conduct their fiscal matters prudently in the overwhelming majority of cases. The Inland Revenue has just published guidance on how it would use the powers in practice, and provided companies and their advisers with formal reassurance that in most cases, the only consequence of getting payments wrong would be an interest charge, not a penalty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Wells asked whether the Inland Revenue could misuse the new information powers relating to quarterly payments by using them to obtain information for other purposes. I reassure him and the Committee that the Revenue is already on record as saying that the information and penalty powers under the instalment payment regulations are there to deal only with cases of flagrant abuse. I repeat that for the overwhelming majority of companies, the only consequence of getting instalment payments wrong would be an interest charge. It is worthwhile for me to repeat that, and I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Fylde for giving me the opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Fylde asked what would constitute deliberate or reckless behaviour. The instalment payments penalty provision exists to provide fairness by ensuring that companies that do not make an honest effort to get their payments right do not have an unfair advantage over those that do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have reassured the hon. Member for Wells, and that, after careful consideration, he will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady suggested that we were against sanctions for those who deliberately do not pay taxes; that is not the case. We wish to restrict the powers of the Inland Revenue, in line with the Government's intentions. The Minister herself said in the explanatory notes—and she has just
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>539</span>
helpfully confirmed—that the Inland Revenue would use those powers only in restricted circumstances. However, good intentions are not enough. Laws are permanent, and people at the top of any organisation can change—we may in due course have a different regulatory culture or different attitudes towards taxpayers. We therefore think it right to incorporate the Minister's intentions into the legislation; nothing that she has said reduces that need. I welcome her statement about the intentions of the Inland Revenue concerning the use of its powers, but that is all the more reason to include the provision in the Bill. We shall press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is concerned with a typical situation in which loss surrenders and claims within a group are made within normal time limits, but tax
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>541</span>
losses are subsequently restricted to a smaller amount than those surrendered. In that instance, the Inland Revenue will have more tax to collect from the group. Clause 83 states that the additional tax may be collected from any other company in the group that has obtained group relief as a result of the surrender. That is a potential nightmare for those buying and selling companies from or into groups. A company that has participated in a group relief claim could, under the clause, be liable for the additional tax arising not only from losses withdrawn, and not available to it, but from losses not available to other companies in the group,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute of Chartered Accountants said of the clause:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As this effectively rewrites existing legislation, we feel that the opportunity should be taken to limit its application to its intended target, namely where the second company benefits from group relief as a result of the withdrawal of the surrender to the first one."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say of new paragraph 75A in clause 83:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is excessively wide, since it is not limited to cases where the second company has received benefit as a result of the withdrawal of the surrender to the first company."</p></blockquote>
In other words, a company in a group, which would have no effect on this change to the group relief arrangements, could still be affected by the clause. Given the number of groups of companies in this country that buy and sell companies all the time, the measure will create an enormous burden on business, especially on fluid, dynamic business in which significant sales and disposals take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 83 provides for the recovery of tax arising from a reduction in the amount available for surrender under the group relief rules. The provision introduced by the clause will apply when the amount of group relief surrendered to a company has been reduced and the company does not pay the additional tax that arises as a consequence. When that occurs, the outstanding tax may be recovered from other companies in the group, to the extent that they have benefited from the surrenders by the same company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause also extends the time limit for an assessment on the defaulting company. The purpose of the provision introduced by the clause is to retain, for company self-assessment, rules introduced by the Finance Act 1990—legislation introduced under the previous Administration—designed to prevent group relief manipulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) suggested that the scope of the clause should be limited to its intended target, namely, where the second company benefits from group relief as a result of the withdrawal of the surrender to the first one. The provision introduced by the clause is drawn no more widely than the provision that it will replace, which was introduced by the previous Conservative Administration. The reduced scope suggested would prevent the provision from dealing adequately with abuse, In particular, it would not offer protection
	<span class='label label-info column'>542</span>
against the possibility of a group's directing the Inland Revenue to recover excess relief from insolvent companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have read the relevant parliamentary debates of the time in 	<i>Hansard.</i> They show that no concern was expressed about this aspect of the existing provision when it was introduced by the previous Administration. It is my understanding that it has caused no difficulties in practice, and that it has been effective in deterring abuse. The Government therefore see no reason to restrict the scope of its replacement, and I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to the exciting subject of oil taxation. The clauses that we are about to debate are fairly narrow and we need not spend a great deal of time on them, but there are one or two points that I should like to raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 85 relates to petroleum revenue tax-exempt fields. Gas sales contracts made before July 1975 are PRT exempt, and the purpose of the clause is to maintain that exemption where such contracts are transferred or replaced. That is a helpful measure, but the industry has asked whether the clause will apply not only to full transfers of contracts but to partial transfers. Will the clause still apply where a company that originally held the contract retains an interest in the relevant field, but its contract is not completely replaced by a new one with another company?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause names the successors to the British Gas Corporation as British Gas plc and British Gas Trading Ltd. Given that we cannot predict what will happen in the future, perhaps the clause should also include possible successors to those companies. As it stands, were either named successor to be taken over, fresh legislation would appear to be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The oil sector is very important to the United Kingdom economy. It is also highly taxed: some fields are taxed at a rate of up to 70 per cent. In the light of recent developments, the oil sector is experiencing greater difficulty than in the past. The price of oil has fallen considerably during the past few years. Many fields are reaching the end of their lives and the industry will be faced with the considerable costs associated with the decommissioning of plant. The Pollution Prevention and Control Bill, which is being debated on the Floor of the House as we speak, is also relevant to the oil industry. It is covered by one of the Bill's clauses, which will also add to the associated costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enormous concern was expressed throughout the industry when the Government undertook the fiscal review. Happily, it appears that the immediate threat
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
posed by the review has now been removed, but the concern remains that it should not be resurrected in any form. It was also felt that additional assistance could be provided to deal with the cash flow problems from which the industry is suffering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Financial Secretary will answer those points, but this is also an opportunity for her to say a little more about the Government's general approach to future tax arrangements for an industry that is, as I am sure all Committee members will agree, essential to our economic well-being.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising those points, because he has given me the opportunity to agree with him and to say that we take the industry seriously. During the past few months, I met representatives from the industry on at least two occasions and the Chancellor has also met them. Of course, those meetings are very helpful and officials have frequent meetings with representatives from the industry. The establishment of the joint Government oil industry task force, chaired by my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Industry (Mr. Battle), demonstrates the importance that the Government attach to helping the industry to deal with low oil prices—although prices have risen a little recently. I believe that, yesterday, the price of oil was $16 a barrel, so there has been some improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have consistently shown their willingness to listen to the concerns of the oil industry, both during last year's consultations and in our current discussions. I am pleased that the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford welcomed the clause, which has also been welcomed by the industry. The clause ensures that companies will not face an unexpected tax charge when they buy into older North sea gas fields. Gas sold to British Gas under a contract made before July 1975 has always been exempt from PRT. That exemption reflects the relatively low prices that have been paid to producers under such contracts. However, the Inland Revenue has recently been advised that, under the law as it stands, the exemption should end if the producer sells his interest in the gas field, even though the buyer would take over the supply to British Gas from the field under a very similar contract. That is not how the law has been interpreted in the past. There is no good reason why, on one day, the sale of gas by a company should be exempt from PRT but, on the following day, the sale of gas from the same field on the same terms by another company should be charged PRT. The Committee will understand the obvious logic of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause removes that unintended charge. It ensures that the exemption can continue when a new company acquires an interest in a field and continues to supply gas to British Gas under the same terms as the previous producer. As this corresponds to how the law has been applied in the past, the clause will apply to past as well as future transactions. As the hon. Gentleman said, this measure has been welcomed by the industry. The hon. Gentleman also asked whether clause 85 would allow the PRT exemption to continue if British Gas Trading Limited transferred the contracts to a new buyer. The answer is no. The clause makes no change to the position. It covers the
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
position of companies selling gas, not the company buying gas. Under current legislation, if British Gas Trading Ltd were to transfer its rights as buyer, we would have to consider whether it was appropriate to allow the PRT exemption to continue and then legislate as necessary. That remains the position under clause 85. This will allow us to decide if there is a case for continuing the PRT exemption in the event of the gas being sold to a different company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about partial transfer. Clause 85 will apply if, for example, company B buys only part of company A's interest in a field, so the answer is yes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at the outset, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments, and for the opportunity briefly to discuss the industry. It is an important industry and I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is designed as an anti-avoidance measure to close a loophole in the law.

Lessors generally require flexibility in the structuring of finance leases, especially for assets with a long build time. A bank might be unwilling to take on the risks involved in the construction of an offshore pipeline, but might be willing to enter into a finance lease once the work is completed. The company would have to own the asset during the construction phase before selling it to the bank when it is completed but before it is brought into use. Although such a transaction would constitute a lease entered into for normal commercial reasons rather than an attempt to avoid tax or to enjoy double relief, the clause could deny petroleum revenue tax relief to part of the lease payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two mechanisms may enable us to get around that difficulty The industry has discussed the problem with the Revenue. It is recognised that the tax treatment of assets with long build times can present special difficulties in the application of the sale and leaseback capital allowance restriction. Inland Revenue tax bulletin No. 35 stated that capital allowance restrictions will not apply if the asset is ordered by the lessor or if the contract is novated to the lessor before the asset is brought into use. The extension of that treatment to include transactions subject to PRT, although helpful, might not solve the problem. In the case of an offshore construction project, it might be practical for a lessor to order the asset. Novation might also be difficult if a collection of

	<span class='label label-info column'>545</span>
items ordered from different suppliers is being assembled to make a larger asset, such as a pipeline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the clause could be amended to limit its application to those assets that have been brought into use by the seller prior to sale and leaseback. A possible solution would be to restrict relief to a qualifying asset, using the definition in section 8 of the Oil Taxation Act 1983. Although we do not oppose the measure in principle, there is concern that genuine commercial transactions might be drawn within the scope of the clause. I should like to know whether there is a way to sort out that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always intrigued—or at least I used to be intrigued—when the Inland Revenue wants to make changes to oil legislation. It is a complex matter. I recall many and exciting innovative ways of avoiding tax. Indeed, when we were in government the then Paymaster General acceded to some of our proposals to close loopholes. I have sympathy with the thrust of the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the part of Inland Revenue press release IR 33, dated 9 March, that deals with clause 86 does not describe the scope and scale of the problem. It is likely that few fields are subject to petroleum revenue tax. Some are old or run down. To justify anti-avoidance legislation—the clause takes up two pages of the Bill, so someone believes that this is a worthwhile measure—we should have some idea of the scope and scale of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Financial Secretary put on record the threat to revenue posed by this so-called loophole?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little sceptical about the nature of the loophole. The sale and leaseback concept is used throughout business after a capital asset has been purchased. It enables a company to replenish its cash flow and treat the payment for the use of the asset differently from an outright purchase. I would be the first to admit that my knowledge of the corporation tax regime is a little rusty, so perhaps the Financial Secretary will help me out. If a company purchased a capital asset and received tax relief against its tax liability, could it not claim tax relief—if it indulged in a sale and leaseback arrangement—against its corporation tax liability for the interest so involved? I am not aware that corporation tax is structured in such a way that the type of transaction affected by clause 86 cannot be part of normal commercial transactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is ruling that out in relation to PRT equitable in tax terms? Could not the loophole—if that is what it is— have been dealt with in another way? I can understand why an oil company, especially one based in an older field, might seek to use an asset to raise capital for further investment. One of the problems of the oil business is that it is worldwide, and money can be moved around in all kinds of ways. An unfair tax advantage might therefore be conferred. Had the clause referred to the use of sale and leaseback in order to recapitalise a particular field, that would have been a good idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford made an important point, to which the Financial Secretary responded, about the importance of the oil and gas industries. If green investment were being encouraged in a particular field, why should the mechanism not apply to moneys raised on that field? As other newer gas fields are subject not to PRT but to corporation tax, I can understand that it might muddy the waters—if I may put it that way—to move money between fields unfairly. Why has the mechanism been used, when sale and leaseback arrangements restricted to reinvesting that money in that field might have been advantageous to the further development of declining fields? Fields that are subject to PRT are, by definition, older fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my questions to probe the Government to justify clause 86. I shall be interested to hear the Financial Secretary's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clauses 86, 87 and 88 prevent companies from avoiding PRT by selling North sea assets and leasing them back. The clauses are a response to recent attempts to avoid PRT in such a way. The scope for abuse of the rules depended on the tax liability of the oil fields and companies concerned. I am anxious to answer some of the points raised by the right hon. Member for Fylde and by the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford. The right hon. Member for Fylde, when he was a Minister, had to contend with some of the same issues with which the Government are dealing. Some companies could arrange sale and leaseback deals to shelter income that would otherwise be taxed. Such deals could also be used to circumvent the PRT rules on interest payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clauses prevent such PRT avoidance by placing a cap on the amount of relief available on lease payments arising from the sale and leaseback of North sea assets on or after Budget day, unless the sale takes place under an unconditional contract entered into before that date. The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford raised the interesting example of a bank insisting that an oil company constructs an asset before the bank buys it and leases it back to the company. He suggested that such deals were not motivated by tax considerations but were similar to normal leases, and asked whether they should be exempted from the clause. Exempting such deals from the clause would run counter to the principle that there is no PRT relief for interest. The deals could be constructed to allow the company to continue to exploit the safeguard loophole that the clause will close. There is no clear case for carving out sale and leaseback deals from the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, as there have to date been only a limited number of sale and leaseback deals in the North sea and given that the clause will not apply to post-1993 deals, which are outside the scope of PRT, any carve-out is unlikely to have a practical effect. Clause 86 will ensure that the amount of PRT relief available following such a sale or leaseback deal will match the PRT relief available if the company had borrowed money and bought the asset outright. In both cases, relief will be restricted to the cost of the asset excluding interest. The clause should not prevent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>547</span>
future deals of that sort from being undertaken for commercial purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked whether the clause will affect normal commercial transactions. We have certainly received no representations that the clause should be dropped, which suggests that the industry accepts the principle underlying the measure. It suggested that the clause could prevent some commercially motivated sale and leaseback deals from going ahead. However, having considered the matter, we do not think that the examples that have been cited support the industry's suggestion. We certainly believe that the chances of a commercially motivated sale and leaseback deal being held up by the measure are negligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Fylde queried the importance of the measure because he examined the matter when he was Financial Secretary. The measure protects a significant amount of PRT. The amount of tax that will be saved depends on several factors, such as the extent to which individual companies would have manipulated the rules to reduce their liability, future prices and the production of oil and gas. The right hon. Gentleman also mentioned the interrelation with corporation tax. As he knows, interest relief is available for corporation tax, but it has never been available for PRT. I hope that my remarks have been helpful and I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady did not respond to my suggestion of another way to close the loophole, which is to allow the same leaseback arrangements to take place if the proceeds from such commercially motivated arrangements were reinvested in the field where the asset that had been the subject of a sale and leaseback arrangement was located. That may be a way of recapitalising that field. Why is the clause drafted in a general way and not as I have outlined?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the right hon. Gentleman knows, when considering the best method, we consider all the elements. His method would not allow the relief for interest, which is the point that I was attempting to get across in my closing remarks. Clearly, we have considered the best way of closing the loophole, and we believe that we have got it right in this clause, which I commend to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the clause is not one with which we would argue. It will ensure that when finance is raised in sale and lease-back deals that are not used for a North sea purpose, it will not be possible to set the interest element of lease rental payments against the ring-fenced corporation tax. It is clearly sensible that relief should apply to North sea investment and not to investment for other purposes.
	<span class='label label-info column'>548</span>
However, concern has been expressed in the industry about the administrative burden that might be created in demonstrating to the Treasury's satisfaction that funds were being channelled into North sea projects, rather than being used for any other purpose. Will the Financial Secretary say a little more about how the Treasury will expect companies to show that, and how to avoid placing too great a burden on them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that point. The ring fence has been a basic principle of North sea taxation, accepted by all Governments, since 1975. It prevents companies from sheltering North sea profits from tax by using losses or reliefs to cover other activities. The industry has expressed no concern to us, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that we keep in close contact with it at both ministerial and official level. We are always available to talk to the industry.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a simple question about the clause, which in general I welcome. Again I recognise, as have several of my hon. Friends, that this is a complex subject. I also recognise this provision, as the Act that it amends is the Finance Act 1994, in which I had an interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision is sensible, and I do not understand why the industry will have had to wait from 17 November 1998 until 31 December 1999 to benefit from this outbreak of common sense on the part of the tax authorities, this further insight into how the system can be made fairer. The Financial Secretary, or rather, her predecessor, announced the Government's intention to make the change on 17 November last year. The Bill will bring this new sensible provision into effect on 31 December 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am spinning out my question rather longer than may seem necessary, because I sense that a response is being formulated in the Financial Secretary's mind. I should be interested to know why such an obviously sensible provision has taken 14 months to wend its way from press release to legislation. The answer to that may now have crystallised in the hon. Lady's mind, to such an extent that she can share it with the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] I remember, when I was first elected as a Member of Parliament in 1992, that within three weeks of my arriving here some of my hon. Friends told me that they were going to do me a great favour and ensure my rapid promotion by making me a member of the Committee considering the Finance Bill. At 5 o'clock in the morning the following week, I was most grateful to them. The right hon. Gentleman was then the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. He will know; he has been there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Gentleman said, clause 90 is important. It has been warmly welcomed by the

	<span class='label label-info column'>549</span>
industry. He asked about the 14-month period, but the commencement date at the end of 1999 is appropriate, as no PRT will have yet been paid on non-UK gas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sense that there would have been no PRT payable, because the current regime for non-UK fields is so unattractive as to ensure that pipelines would not have been used, and no tax would therefore be payable. That still leaves the question of why the pipeline operators have had to wait 14 months for the law to be changed in such as a way as to make their business competitive. The substantive point is not the loss of PRT payments, but the fact that the 14-month time lag, which Government have now admitted, has left those firms uncompetitive for longer than was necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept what the right hon. Gentleman says. He knows that when one drafts legislation, particularly on such a complex matter,
	<span class='label label-info column'>550</span>
which is so important to the industry that every part of it is scrutinised, it is important to get it right. There is no suggestion of any loss; indeed, we understand that the pipeline operators are happy with the commencement date. When my predecessor as Financial Secretary, who is now the Paymaster General, made the announcement, it was warmly welcomed. We had to get the measure right, nobody has suffered, and we have now taken the opportunity to use the Finance Bill to achieve that change.
