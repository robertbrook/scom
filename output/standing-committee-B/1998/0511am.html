</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Whittingdale <span class='memberconstituency'>(Maldon and East Chelmsford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have already heard a number of good speeches from Opposition members of the Committee in support of the amendments, so I shall not go over those arguments again. However, I should like to touch on a few points that have yet to be made fully.<br><br>
The key issue is that the differential between the price of tobacco products in this country and on the continent is encouraging smuggling on a huge scale. It is true that the previous Government implemented a policy of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
increasing the price by means of an escalator. However, there comes a point when the profit that can be made as a result of that differential increases dramatically, and I believe that we have now passed that point.<br><br>
A few weeks ago I visited Adinkerke, in Belgium, with the Tobacco Alliance. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I should tell Government members of the Committee that the Tobacco Alliance represents 26,000 independent cigarette retailers. As a result of the Government's policy, many such retailers are suffering. Indeed, many are being driven out of business by the current extent of smuggling.<br><br>
With some independent retailers, I visited Eastenders, a warehouse store with which some hon. Members may be familiar, run by Dave West and his wife Kathy. Eastenders specialises in the selling in bulk of cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco, and its customers are exclusively British. During my visit I saw a steady stream of vehicles, all of which had British registration plates, loading large quantities of tobacco. The journey to Eastenders is remarkably easy—one crosses the channel on Eurostar and drives a short distance across the Belgian border—and takes no longer than a couple of hours.<br><br>
I saw a man place £1,000 in cash on the counter at Eastenders to buy hand-rolling tobacco. In Belgium, hand-rolling tobacco costs £2 a pack; in this country it costs £8 a pack. Therefore he paid £1,000 for a quantity of hand-rolling tobacco that would retail at £4,000 in the United Kingdom. He duly loaded the tobacco into the boot of his car and I asked him whether that was something that he did regularly. He replied, "Oh yes—about once every three months."<br><br>
As the Minister knows, it is perfectly legal to import tobacco into this country for one's own consumption, but it strains credulity to imagine that that man intended to consume £4,000-worth of hand-rolling tobacco in three months. He was merely one of hundreds of such visitors to Eastenders, which is open 24 hour a day.<br><br>
Mrs. West, a delightful lady, told me that she and her husband celebrated when the Budget was announced—they were probably the only people in the world who did. For them, it represented a real opportunity to increase sales and make more profit. Mr. Dave West said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There's brands of cigarettes on sale here in Belgium that Belgians don't smoke, so it's obvious that these cigarettes are destined for British people and are going back to England. It's very clear, the amounts of cigarettes that are sold—for example, we sell now I think it's one third of all the cigarettes and tobacco that's sold in the entirety of Belgium. Now, we don't have any Belgian customers."</p></blockquote>
That is what is happening at the small-scale end of the business. People are filling up transit vans, Land Rovers or the backs of their cars, for themselves and their friends, and to make a few bob selling the cigarettes in the pub car park.<br><br>
Unfortunately, that is not the only aspect of the business. There is now a great deal of involvement by organised crime. There are worrying reports that the IRA has now moved into the business in Ireland. I should like to draw the attention of the Committee to a recent television programme, "Tonight with Trevor McDonald", which looked into the matter. The reporter said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It's Wednesday morning in Dover docks, and a massive load of six million cigarettes has been discovered inside a container lorry, all disguised as an innocent consignment of kiwi fruit. Cigarette
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0059">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
smuggling is now a major underground industry; it's run by organised crime on an international scale. The techniques they use are those of the drug smugglers and the attraction is that if you get caught, cigarettes, unlike drugs, carry low penalties."</p></blockquote>
The reporter set up a deal with a smuggler. He contacted someone named David through another gentleman known as Torquay Paul, and arranged to purchase 200,000 cigarettes at less than half the legal price. He said that David gave them a rendezvous point near the M25 in Essex, where they were to meet another gang member, Georthe Denis. For the purposes of the programme, the deal was set up, and at the end, the reporter made himself known to Georthe Denis. I shall not quote what Georthe Denis said—I shall leave that to the imagination of members of the Committee.<br><br>
That was a graphic demonstration of the hugh scale of the business now being conducted. We are heading rapidly towards the same problem that we began to experience a few years ago with hand-rolling tobacco. Eight years ago, nearly all hand-rolling tobacco sales were fully duty-paid. The proportion is now 25 per cent. Seventy-five per cent, of hand-rolling tobacco sales are now non-duty-paid—the vast bulk is illegally imported. The Chancellor recognised the problem to some extent and did not increase the duty on it, although he did increase duty on other things.<br><br>
The amendment would cut the duty on hand-rolling tobacco to what it was when the Government took office. There is no doubt that the hand-rolling tobacco market has been lost. Very few legal hand-rolling tobacco sales are taking place. The retailers, and the Tobacco Alliance, now say that they do not sell it. No one buys it any longer, because they can get it so much more cheaply through the black market. That is happening not only here but in Sweden, which, because of its accession to the European Union, was required to increase the duty on cigarettes dramatically. The first increase was 25 per cent, in January 1997, followed in August 1997 by a further 29 per cent., which resulted in an overall excise duty increase of 62.5 per cent.<br><br>
The result was a huge increase in smuggling. The Swedish customs board estimated that 39.3 million cigarettes were smuggled into Sweden in 1997, compared with an estimated six million in 1995. A senior customs official stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"organised crime is focusing more on cigarettes than narcotics today because the profit is better and the risk is minimal."</p></blockquote>
The parallel with events in this country is clear.
When the Swedish Government were confronted by the problem, they took dramatic action. They cut the rate of duty in the 1998 budget by approximately 30 per cent. In the budget proposal, the Swedish Government said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Since cigarette prices on the Swedish market are so high compared with neighbouring countries and the prices of cigarettes sold illegally, the profitability of cross-border trade and smuggling will continue to be great enough so as to necessitate additional measures. It is therefore important to reduce the prices on the legal cigarette market."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
We are not proposing to cut the duty today, but there is no doubt that dramatic measures are needed. I hope that the Government will look closely at what happens in Sweden as a result of its decision. Preliminary evidence shows that the proportion of the market taken by legal sales has started to increase following that cut in duty.<br><br>
This is a serious problem and it will get worse. I draw the Financial Secretary's attention to information provided by Customs and Excise, for which her Department is responsible. The Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents Customs and Excise employees, said in its briefing paper:
<br><blockquote><p>"The published estimate for 1996 stated that 1.5 per cent, of the market in cigarettes was lost through cross-channel smuggling. By 1998 the figure had risen to 10 per cent. The Department now estimates that present trends suggest that smuggled cigarettes will soon comprise 30 per cent, of the UK market."</p></blockquote>
I have already pointed out that 75 per cent, of hand-rolling tobacco is smuggled. The PCSU also said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is evidence that the Italian Mafia and organised Eastern European gangs are involved as well as UK criminals."</p></blockquote>
I conclude by drawing the Committee's attention to an excellent speech which made those points well. In the 1995 Finance Bill debate on tobacco duty, the current Paymaster General said:
<br><blockquote><p>"As they did during the debate on alcohol, the Government completely close their eyes to the implications of their tobacco taxation policy and the way in which it will provide opportunities for tobacco smuggling. Smuggling not only undermines the industry here, and therefore will eventually weaken what tax base there is, but undermines the Government's health policy, because the contraband goods are unregulated and available to the very groups for whom the Government's health policy, "The Health of the Nation", sets targets to reduce smoking—the 11 to 15-year-old age range.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>By pursuing the tobacco industry, through taxation, the Government are undermining that. We have made clear our views on the health aspects, on curtailing smoking and encouraging people not to smoke, but taxation is not the way to do that."</p></blockquote>
That was what the Paymaster General said just four years ago. She concluded by saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"The industry itself has produced substantial and convincing arguments. I say that as a committed anti-smoker. The information provided by the tobacco industry shows only too clearly the disastrous route down which the Government's taxation policy is taking us. We will lose control of tax. We will lose control, through tobacco products, of our health policy and we will undermine considerably the country's industry."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 23 January 1995; Vol. 253, c. 106–7.]</p></blockquote>
If that was the Labour party's view in 1995, surely it must be its view today, because the problem is far worse. There is evidence that the proportion of people in this country who smoke has started to increase again. In 1994, the general household survey put that proportion at 27 per cent, and in 1996 at 28 per cent. Latest research shows that in 1997 it stood at 28.2 per cent, and in 1998 at 28.5 per cent. The proportion of people who smoke is beginning to increase. It must be apparent that a major determinant of those figures is the increase in smuggling and the ease with which it is possible to obtain cut-price cigarettes illegally.<br><br>
The policy of increasing tobacco taxation year after year is failing. The proportion of the population who smoke is increasing, businesses are being driven under by illegal imports and the Government's revenue from tobacco tax is forecast to fall. If the policy is failing to that extent, surely it makes sense to stop and reconsider
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0060">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
it. That is why we propose a freeze on tobacco duties and a full re-examination of the whole issue. Unless that is done, the problem will simply get worse.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) has just made the final contribution to this interesting debate, which began last week, when some excellent speeches were made by Labour Members.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for highlighting the fact that the Opposition stand by their amendments. Several interesting articles on this subject appeared in the press last Tuesday. One headline stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Tories give a whiff of hope to smokers".</p></blockquote>
Another particularly interesting article, which described the health lobby's reaction, was headed: "Tories make em fume". I make no comment on another headline: "Fag-end Tories".<br><br>
An article in the <i>Financial Times,</i> which worried me considerably, stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Conservative Treasury team's hostility to higher tobacco duties…came as something of a surprise to"—</p></blockquote>
the Conservative party's Front-Bench health team, and said that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) and the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford had to have last-minute talks to reconcile their approach. This sympathetic Labour Government often have to sit back and watch such distressing scenes. Last Tuesday, I saw the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe), who is the Opposition's Front-Bench spokesman on health, outside in the Corridor, and I felt for the hon. Gentleman because I thought that he was in for a hard time.<br><br>
I shall answer some of the questions raised in our debate. The right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), who is in Committee now, asked what the Government's policies were. They involve the approach that has been pursued by successive Governments for good, urgent health reasons. Smoking kills more than 120,000 people a year in the United Kingdom, and evidence shows that high taxes are an important way to reduce tobacco consumption.<br><br>
However, taxation is just one part of the Government's anti-smoking strategy. We have introduced the first NHS programme to help people quit over a three-year period, with funding of more than £60 million. No previous Government have provided such support. In relation to tobacco revenue, the Chancellor said in his Budget speech that he would bring forward the duty increases from December to March to pay for the package of measures for pensioners, which he also announced in that speech. How will the Opposition fill that gap in the revenue, and what will they say to pensioners?<br><br>
The rates in different members states were mentioned on several occasions. Cutting tobacco duty to the Belgian level could cost the Exchequer £4.5 billion in lost revenue, and the Opposition's amendment would cost the Exchequer up to £2.5 billion. The Opposition seem to fritter money away. During the debate on the Budget, the Second Reading debate on the Bill and in Committee,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
moving amendment after amendment, Opposition members have never said how they would pay for their proposals, would they increase income tax to pay for them?<br><br>
The effect of smuggling and fraud on revenue objectives is a serious threat. The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, who has just smoken—<i>[Laughter.]</i> Much of the revenue would go up in smoke if the hon. Gentleman who has just smoken, and spoken, had his way. We share his view that organised crime plays a part in that threat, but to give in to organised crime, as Opposition Members suggest, would be blatant nonsense.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) said that Customs did not have the resources to cope with the present level of smuggling. That is not so. We have allocated an additional £35 million over three years to Customs to support the implementation of the alcohol and tobacco fraud review. There are now 420 excise verification officers in place, compared with only 250 in 1993. The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford referred to my hon. Friend the Paymaster General. When she became Financial Secretary she immediately increased the resources available to Customs and Excise and, at a stroke, ensured that our health and revenue policy was protected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will not the comprehensive spending review result in a cut of 1,200 in the number of staff working in Customs and Excise?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must get his facts right. As in any Government Department, efficiency exercises are always taking place. Any reductions will not be in front-line staff. We have not only protected front-line staff, we have increased their number. The hon. Gentleman must answer for the fact that we have increased the number of those valuable officers to 420, whereas there were only 250 of them in 1993. If the hon. Gentleman and his party care so much about the matter, what would they do about it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Colin Breed <span class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Cornwall)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Have not the verification officers been redesignated from other posts, so that no new posts have been produced?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The verification officers have a vital role. The hon. Gentleman mentioned Plymouth at our previous sitting, and I shall deal with that subject specifically when I come to it.<br><br>
It is distressing that when the men and women in Customs and Excise provide a vital and valuable service, often with great difficulty, their successes are not celebrated by Opposition Members. During the first six months of 1998–99 the tax value of cross-channel detection by excise verification officers was £62 million, which was an increase of £29 million from the value in the equivalent period in the previous year. It would have been pleasing to hear from Opposition Members some indication that they value the work of customs officers, the police and the joint agency.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) has referred to resources at Plymouth. I assure him that there has been no reduction in the staff deployed on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0061">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
detection of alcohol smuggling in Plymouth. In fact, there has been a small increase in excise enforcement and in the number of fiscal intelligence officers.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cotswold and the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford commented on Canada and Sweden, and suggested that we follow their example. The parallel with Canada and Sweden is too easily drawn. In both cases, the reduction was part of a wider package of anti-fraud measures. Furthermore, Sweden reduced its duty rate only in August, so it is too early to draw conclusions.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), in a helpful contribution, pointed out that low-taxing countries, such as Spain and Italy, where the duty on a packet of 20 cigarettes is only 47p and 77p respectively, also suffer significant levels of smuggling from third countries. Conservative Members should therefore ensure that they mention all the facts to the Committee.<br><br>
A number of hon. Members said that smuggling was creating a criminal culture, which is true. That is no reason, however, to give in to that culture and condone it by saying, "Because we have this problem, we will cut the rate of duty".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Dorrell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Charnwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary has now said twice that removing the duty discrepancy that creates the incentive for smuggling is giving in to smugglers. Can she explain how removing the opportunity that smugglers exploit is giving in to them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the right hon. Gentleman, especially as he is a former Secretary of State for Health. A serious criminal culture also surrounds the drugs problem. Do we suggest removing the incentive for that market by legalisation? Of course not. That is why the Government, and all right-thinking hon. Members, have firmly rejected legalisation. The right hon. Gentleman's argument is complete nonsense.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) reminded the Committee of the harm that smoking does. For every 1,000 20-year-old smokers, one will be murdered, six will the in motor accidents, 250 will die in middle age as a result of smoking, and 250 will die in old age as a result of smoking. United Kingdom studies show that a 1 per cent, increase in real price will reduce demand by between 0.2 per cent, and 0.6 per cent. I have already mentioned the real help that exists for smokers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No Opposition Member would argue about the damage that smoking does to people's health. Is the Financial Secretary saying that her hon. Friend the Paymaster General was wrong when she said that smuggling undermined the Government's health policy, and taxation was not the way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course my hon. Friend the Paymaster General was right when she said mat smuggling undermined the Government's health policy. That is why, as soon as she took up her post, she put the necessary resources into Customs and Excise, which had been wilfully neglected by the previous Government.<br><br>

I understand and accept that the hon. Gentleman genuinely wants to deal with smoking. I hope, however, that he will forgive me for saying that I find his plans for doing so extraordinary. Last Tuesday, he spoke on the "Today" programme. Not only were his plans criticised by all the cancer research charities in this country, which comprise many eminent men and women, but by Mr. Clive Bates, the director of Action on Smoking and Health, who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Opposition's plan to reverse the escalator because of illegal activity iscompletely spineless."</p></blockquote>
Those are not my words but those of the director of a national organisation that is well known for its stance on this subject. So the hon. Gentleman's protestations that the Opposition are doing their best to support anti-smoking health policies ring hollow.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward) said that the source of cigarettes for many under-age and other young smokers was illegal activity. The hon. Gentleman is not in his place at the moment, but most children who smoke say that they buy their cigarettes from shops. That makes us even more determined to work with local enforcement agencies to ensure that everyone complies with the law.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
Sadly, the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), who began the debate, is not in his place at the moment. He referred to the downward revision of the forecast for tobacco revenue, implying that smuggling was undermining our revenue objectives. Yes, the forecast is down, but the growth in tobacco smuggling accounts for only a small proportion of that reduction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the rest?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members must curb their impatience. Everything comes to those who wait. I welcome the right hon. Member for Wells to the Committee; I was just speaking about him.<br><br>
Most of the downward revision is accounted for by the effect that bringing forward the escalator from December to March will have on cash receipts.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton asked, quite understandably, about progress on the implementation of the alcohol and tobacco review.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was listening carefully to the Financial Secretary, and she said that part of the drop in revenue to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells referred in his speech, and the difference between the forecast and the Budget estimate of £1.9 billion were caused by bringing forward the escalator. Bringing forward the escalator would imply an increase in duty, not a decrease. Can the hon. Lady explain that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes I can. What will happen—this has happened in previous years—is that, as a result of the change that we have implemented, there will be no significant forestalling by manufacturers in 1999–2000, which will result in a substantial reduction in duty receipts

this year. It is a very temporary effect. In later years, the net effect on cash receipts will be positive. Again, a little research on the part of Opposition Members would have given them that information.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always a pleasure to give way to an Opposition Whip.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There used to be a hotline that members of the public could ring if they were aware of smuggling or some other breach of customs rules. Is that scheme still in place? If so, why is it not publicised?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mrs.Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So far as I am aware, the answer is yes, the hotline is still in place, and it is publicised, As I am sure the hon. Gentleman will be pleased to know, I have had meetings with the trade and I think that the hotline is used. Of course I would be pleased—as, I hope would Opposition Members—if as many members of the public as possible used it. The Committee should send out that strong message to express what we feel about smuggling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs.Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I shall give way to the Whip again,</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I promise not to speak too much in Committee, but can the Financial Secretary explain how the hotline is publicised? One never sees any publicity for it anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy to find that out for the hon. Gentleman, and I shall ensure that the information is given to all Committee members. Perhaps we could all make sure that the hotline is well publicised in our constituencies, which would send out a strong message.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: A moment ago, the hon. Lady said that only a small proportion of the fall in revenues from tobacco duty was due to smuggling. Why, therefore, does the Red Book say in paragraph B28:
<br><blockquote><p>"The forecast of receipts from tobacco duty also takes account of new evidence, available since the PBR, that cigarette smuggling and the loss of revenue associated with it, has been growing rapidly."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We accepted that. [<i>Interruption.</i>] It may be a little early in the morning for some Opposition Members, but they must pay attention. I said that the right hon. Member for Wells had appeared to suggest that the entire fall was due to smuggling, but that is not, of course, the case. We accept that smuggling has had an effect, which is why we are determined to do something about it.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbition asked what progress had been made in terms of implementing proposals from the alcohol and tobacco fraud review. Progress is well under way, and many measures will be implemented by the end of 1999. As I said, some measures have already been implemented, and more than
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
100 additional staff are in place. Policies relating to prosecutions and seized vehicles have been revised, which I am sure will be welcomed.<br><br>
My. hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) ably reminded us of the record of the right hon. Member for Charnwood, who has performed a significant U-turn in this context. The situation is very sad.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Witney discussed the effect of tax increased on poorer people. We have ensured that the NHS provides real support to help smokers to quit. For example, for the first time nicotine patches are being made available free of charge to those who are least able to afford them. Our measures have been warmly welcomed by Labour Members.<br><br>
We had a long and, in some ways, very good debate, in which many important matters were raised. The amendment leaves many questions unanswered. Cutting or freezing duty rats would lead to a rise in smoking. How would the Opposition discourage young people from smoking, and how would they deal with the fact that freezing duty rates would not stop smuggling? How would they make up the revenue shortfall? Amendment No. 9 would cost £2.5 billion, and amendments Nos. 2 to 5, which were proposed by the shadow Treasury Front Bench, would cost £455 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the previous general election the Financial Secretary and her colleagues stood on a platform of not increasing taxes. No one denies that the duties should not be indexed, but indexing way beyond the rate of inflation involves a clear increase in taxation, and the Financial Secretary's party was elected on a commitment not to introduce such changes. How can she fill that black hole?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was waiting for the hon. Gentleman to ask that question. We take no lessons from the Conservative party in this regard. An article last week in <i>The Times</i> stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Tory move means a reversal of the party's policy at the last election. The 1997 Conservative campaign guide said that a Tory government would have continued to raise duty"—</p></blockquote>
<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman must not protest about the fact that he has been caught out. I hate to give advice, but one should never ask a question if one cannot predict what the answer will be.<br><br>
I hope that I hate convinced the Opposition to withdraw the amendment. If they do not, I hope that my hon. Friends will vote against it.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
The Financial Secretary, in a typically politically robust speech, failed to address the central flaw in the Government's tobacco taxation policy. The flaw takes two forms, the first of which is that it fails on health grounds. The total incidence of cigarette smoking is increasing. Tobacco duty is regressive and hits the poor. Cigarette smoking among young people, particularly women, is increasing. The Financial Secretary said that the Government are generously giving out nicotine patches, but their provision is so measly that it does not help everyone on income support, let alone anyone else.<br><br>
The second aspect of the flaw is that the policy fails to protect Government revenue. The Financial Secretary asked what the Opposition would do to secure the shortfall. The answer is obvious: the Government should increase the resources of Her Majesty's Customs and Excise to deal with the problem properly. Dame Valerie Strachan, who, as chairman of Customs and Excise, appeared before the Public Accounts Committee yesterday, said mat between 1997 and 1998, Customs and Excise staff was reduced by 1,236 and mat a further reduction of 1,200 staff is proposed. That is a reduction of 2,500 staff. What is the Government's response? They have decided to give an extra £35 million over three years, which will create a mere 100 extra jobs to replace the 2,500 lost. The Financial Secretary claimed that the cuts have involved back-room staff. That may be so, but back-room functions still have to be carried out and front-line operations suffer as a result. I gave plenty of examples of that in my opening remarks.<br><br>
The rate of smuggling is increasing. It is all very well for the hon. Lady to say that we should increase duty to prevent the consumption of cigarettes. That would work in a perfect market but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford said, it is easy to smuggle cigarettes from the continent. The policy will not work because smuggling will increase. We should freeze duty, increase the resources to Her Majesty's Customs and Excise and stop the huge haemorrhage that is taking place as a result of smuggling.<br><br>
The forecast between the November pre-Budget statement and the Red Book shows that total duties that the Revenue receives are expected to decrease from £99.7 billion to £99.2 billion. The Government are not protecting revenue. It is interesting to note that in every case where duty is being increased in excess of inflation—cigarettes, fuel, beer and cider—the revenue forecast has dropped. An increase in duty that is higher than inflation results in an increase in smuggling. Everyone knows that.<br><br>
I shall withdraw my amendment on the basis mat I will support the amendments tabled by my right hon. and hon. Friends. I hope that they will press their amendments to a vote because the situation is eminently unsatisfactory. The Government should look at the resources that they are giving to Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. Every Opposition Member applauds its work and no one condones smuggling or increased smoking, but those factors are not being tackled by the Government. I urge them to reconsider their policies.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 3, line 1, leave out from 'shall' to end of line 2 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'come into force on 1st December 1999.'.</p></blockquote>
I do not wish to detain the Committee unduly on the amendment, which merely flags up the fact that the Government have not only increased the duty on cigarettes by raising the escalator to five per cent., but brought forward the date of implementation. That is yet another example of stealth taxation. Smokers will have to pay the increase with effect from Budget day, rather than from 1 December 1999, as was the case. We oppose the increase and the amendment would restore the previous position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given that the measure was introduced and announced on Budget day, it is rather odd to be accused of taxation by stealth.<br><br>
The Chancellor's intention is to align the timing of all excise duty changes with the spring Budget. With regard to tobacco duties, the decision to implement duty increased in March 1999, rather than to defer them until March 2000, again underlines the Government's commitment to our new tobacco strategy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary confirm a matter that we failed to elucidate during last Tuesday's sitting? She said mat, henceforth, the Chancellor's strategy is for all excise duty increases to

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
take effect on Budget day. Clearly, most rates of alcohol duty have not changed, but are we to assume that, under the new policy, any future increases will take effect on Budget day rather than later in the year?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly surprised by the hon. Gentleman's question. I refer him to the Chancellor's speech, which I am sure he will find makes interesting reading. I cannot see how the Chancellor can make his announcements any more public than that<br><br>.
The alteration in the timing of changes to tobacco duty this year has also helped to reduce the incidence of bulk clearances of cigarettes from manufacturers' duty-suspense facilities in advance of duty increases. That ensures that revenue receipts are protected and health objectives are met. Yet again, the Opposition have not said how we might recoup the £620 million that their amendment would cost. I suppose that that is too much to expect from the hon. Gentleman, but I would be interested to hear it.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. If not, I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am profoundly unconvinced by the Minister's arguments, but I do not wish to detain the Committee, as we have made our point clear. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 11 in page 3, line 2, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(3) Subject to subsection (4) below, this section shall cease to have effect after 6 o'clock in the evening of 31st December 1999.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4) If the House of Commons before the 30th December 1999 adopts by affirmative resolution a report from Her Majesty's Treasury that details the measures the Government proposes to take to combat tobacco fraud following its current round of consultations on the recommendations published in January 1998 following Her Majesty's Customs and Excise Alcohol and Tobacco Fraud Review, subsection 3 above shall take effect.'.</p></blockquote>
The Liberal Democrats have supported the Government's increase in duty on tobacco. We believe that the Government must pursue health objectives and that those are furthered by increasing tobacco duty. We share their concern, and the concern of the official Opposition, that that method of pursuing health objectives is undermined by smuggling. Unlike the official Opposition, we believe that some of the alternative ways of tackling smuggling, as set out in the alcohol and tobacco fraud review, should be pursued in the first instance. Those methods offer the prospect of a reduction in smoking and an increase in revenues, while maintaining the fight against the increase in smoking.<br><br>
The amendment would link the increase in tobacco duties to action by the Government in pursuing vigorously the recommendations of the alcohol and tobacco fraud review, which the Minister mentioned in the previous debate. We want that obligation put on the statute book, as the problem needs to be monitored carefully and assiduously over the coming months. The Government must not delay consultations, they must explain the results of consultations to the House and they must proceed with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
any recommendations that have trade and cross-party consent. As duty is to be increased, they must also report on the success of measures to protect that revenue.<br><br>
We want to give the Financial Secretary an opportunity to elaborate further on her comments about the review, on the Government's commitment to the review, and on how they envisage the review being implemented over the remainder of this year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's remarks are helpful. I assume that his reason, in part, for moving the amendment is to pursue the debate on how measures can be put in place. We are grateful for the Liberal Democrats' support in this matter. As I have said, we are very concerned about tobacco smuggling and fraud.<br><br>
As the Committee will know, we commissioned the review shortly after taking office in 1997. I have already mentioned the tremendous part that my hon. Friend the Paymaster General played in that. The recommendations were published last summer, and a significant number have already been implemented. Significant additional resources were allocated for Customs and Excise as part of the comprehensive spending review. I assure the hon. Gentleman, and the whole Committee, that we will always keep the House informed of significant developments in the fight against smuggling and fraud.<br><br>
Customs and Excise continues to work closely with our European counterparts and with the trade on implementing the remaining recommendations of the alcohol and tobacco fraud review. I want to place on record the Government's thanks to the trade for the part that it has played; we are grateful for its collaboration with us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Breed</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us whether the penalties for smuggling are to be considered in the review? There is a feeling that the penalties exacted on people who are caught are insufficient, and that more people may be prepared to engage in tobacco smuggling, rather than drugs smuggling, because the penalties for the latter are extremely high.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those matters have been taken into account in prosecution policy, and in relation to seized vehicles. The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall is right to mention the increasing role of organised crime, as is the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford. The Government are concerned about that issue. Those gangs also commit other serious offences when they are engaged in such trafficking. I assure the Committee that the police, Customs and Excise and all other agencies involved will use the full rigour of the law to ensure that people who perpetrate those crimes and create a climate of criminality will be brought to justice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question of what is permitted for personal consumption seems to cause confusion, in relation to smuggling. Many documentaries have been made on the subject. Huge vans go over the English channel to bring back cigarettes, alcohol and other commodities. Will the Minister look into this and ensure that the rules are tightened, so that only those who genuinely intend to use those commodities for personal consumption are permitted to do so?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0065">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. He is referring to the indicative limits which were, in part, set by the previous Government. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford for having raised the point that one should not confuse purchases legitimately made by members of the public—exercising their right as participants in the single market to make purchases according to those indicative limits—with the organised trade that is taking place. It is important to keep those two issues separate.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton for mentioning the importance of the alcohol and tobacco fraud review. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall continue to keep the House informed on that matter. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment, which would require the Government to produce a document, possibily at the wrong time, or at a time inconvenient to the House. I am not persuaded that that is necessary. If the hon. Gentleman does press the amendment to a Division, I would urge my hon. Friends to vote against it.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's assurance that the government intend to pursue the matter and to return to Parliament so that we can scrutinise their actions in the review.<br><br>
Will the Minister comment more specifically on recommendations in the review? I wanted this debate so that she could tell the Committee how the Government are minded on specific recommendations. One, on which the trade press has commented and which I understand the Government are considering, is the recommendation for cigarettes and other specified tobacco products to be marked in a prominent position on the front of the pack, "For sale in the UK only." That would assist Excise officers to identify which cigarettes had been smuggled and which had not. In conjunction with another recommendation that the handling and sale of smuggled cigarettes and tobacco products be made an offence, mat would massively increase the powers of Customs and Excise to pursue smuggling and, hopefully, to reduce it. Will the Minister comment on those specific recommendations before I ask leave to withdraw the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to do so. We are having discussions with the trade on recommendations to which the hon. Gentleman referred. On his second point, local enforcement officers have a role to play. We are discussing and considering everything in the review, as well as minimum indicative limits, to which the hon. Member for Cotswold referred, but that would require the unanimous agreement of all 15 member states of the European Union, which is often a lengthy process.<br><br>
We are having discussions with the trade and all the proposals in the view are being considered. We have implemented those that can be implemented immediately—for example, the important recommendation for extra officers—and we shall consider everything in the review as speedily as possible.</span></p>

RATE OF POOL BETTING DUTY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of me Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me make it clear from the outset that we support clause 6 and welcome the Government's decision to reduce pool betting duty from 26.5 per cent, to 17.5 per cent. The pools industry is important and faces serious difficulties. It would be wrong to pass over the clause without saying a few words about it.<br><br>
This is the fourth reduction in pool betting duty. The previous Government made three reductions from 42.5 per cent, to 26.5 per cent, in recognition of the enormous impact of the national lottery on the pools industry. Before its introduction, there was a steady growth in turnover, roughly in line with inflation, in the pools industry and in 1994 the total pools market came to £988 million. By me end of 1998, just four years later, that market had declined by 70 per cent, to just £290 million, and mat decline continues. There has been a steady, downward trend since the national lottery came into being.<br><br>
As a result, total revenue from pool betting duty has fallen from £341 million in 1994–95 to £96 million in 1997–98. Pools companies have had to take painful decisions. Littlewoods, the largest company by far, has approximately 80 per cent, of the market. Vernons has about 16 per cent, and Zetters has the remainder. The pools industry traditionally employs many collectors, but the number has fallen by 50 per cent, to fewer than 40,000. For example, Vernons, which is based on Merseyside, had more than 1,000 full-time employees at the end of 1994. By the end of 1998, that figure had fallen to just 173.<br><br>
The huge contraction of pools companies has also affected the amount of money provided for causes that benefit from pools companies, such as the Football Trust, the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, and the Football League. Pools companies have attempted to take on the competition. Vernons introduced a new game, called Easy Play, which tired to emulate the national lottery. Unfortunately, Easy Play was unable to compete with the huge prizes that the national lottery offers, and has been discontinued.<br><br>
The pools industry made an extremely persuasive case for the proposed reduction in pool betting duty to me same level as VAT. Littlewoods said that the pools industry's survival depended on such a reduction, which would bring long-term benefit to the Treasury. Littlewoods calculated a net present value of £70 million. The extra money made available will be invested in the industry. For example, Littlewoods intend to introduce new hand-held terminals
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0066">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
for its collectors. Trials for such terminals are being conducted in Basildon, which is not far from my constituency. Littlewoods believes that such investment will help stop the decline and enable it to survive.<br><br>
All hon. Members have probably received the brief from Camelot, which argues that the company is already heavily taxed—more heavily than football pools companies. It quotes an effective tax rate of 79 per cent, for the national lottery, compared with 48 per cent, for the football pools. I must say that those figures, which have been arrived at by lumping together various components of the national lottery's total take, are somewhat unconvincing. Committee members are unlikely to be persuaded that the national lottery is suffering hugely from excessive taxation. It was one of the successes of the previous Government, and we welcome that success. However, because of its strong position, competing industries, particularly the pools companies, are finding life difficult.<br><br>
We certainly welcome the proposed reduction in pool betting duty. I hope that the Government will keep the mater under review, because the pools industry is suffering. If the reduction fails to reverse the industry's decline, we may need to reconsider the problem in future Finance Bills.<br><br>
I should point out that Camelot said that there was a case for re-examining the regulation and taxation of the gaming industry. Given the great diversity in the taxation of gambling methods, that may be a strong argument.<br><br>
The Opposition support the clause, but I felt it important to say something about an industry that continues to employ many people who live in deprived areas, and which continues to play an important part in the life of our nation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself and other Liberal Democrats with many of the hon. Gentleman's remarks. The reduction in pool betting duty is extremely welcome, particularly on Merseyside, which he mentioned. The pools companies have been important employers on Merseyside, which is an area of high unemployment and great deprivation. When the previous Government introduced the National Lottery Act 1998, many of their Back-Bench supporters, including the Member who represented Surbition at that time, denied that it would have an impact on the pools industry and lead to a reduction in employment. History has shown those claims to be bogus; pools companies have suffered severely because of the introduction of the national lottery.<br><br>
The cut in pool duty has not come before time. Many people in pools companies are worried that it may come too late. That does not represent a complaint against the Government, who have taken action relatively speedily.<br><br>
We discussed this subject when we considered last year's Finance Bill, when both sides of the Committee urged the Government to take quick action. I am glad that they responded by proposing a large cut. However, in relation to competition between the national lottery and the pools companies, the Government's proposal comes late in the day. I agree with the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, who suggested that the Government
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
should keep the matter under review and return to it if they find that pools companies' turnover and employment—especially in relation to Merseyside—do not pick up.<br><br>
Unlike the hon. Gentleman, I did not receive Camelot's briefing—perhaps my office has not yet passed it on to me—but, like him, I am unconvinced by the figures that he read out. We need to consider the relative levels of tax duties on the relevant companies and the other competitive advantages that are involved. The national lottery gets hugh marketing and advertising advantages from its television airing. The relative levels of tax duty between the pools companies and the national lottery involves the right approach, but we need to go further in that regard.<br><br>
Another argument for supporting pools companies, as the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford said, involves the funding that they give to the Football Trust and to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, which help many small football clubs in this country. I hope that such funding will go to the local football club in my constituency, Kingstonian, which I hope will win the FA Trophy this Saturday at Wembley. The team's increasing prowess and success should make it a prime candidate for future funding from the Football Trust. That small local example shows the benefits of supporting the pools companies, which the Government acknowledge. I hope that they sustain their approach.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I start by wishing the very best to Kingstonian, which the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbition supports. I am happy to do so because it is not in contention with perhaps the finest team in the land, Tottenham Hotspur.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, and to the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, for their speeches. It is right to spend some time discussing the pools industry's contribution and the importance of the number of people whom it employs, in some instances in areas that had previously suffered high unemployment rates.<br><br>
The clause introduces a reduction of nine percentage points in the rate of pool betting duty. Pools companies have seen their turnover decline by about 70 per cent, since 1994. The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford rightly said that there had been two previous reductions in pool betting duty, both of five percentage points, in May and December 1995, which were made to assist the industry. This further cut is intended to help the pools companies invest in their future.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
I have taken the opportunity to meet the industry. It is heartening to hear its plans for modernisation by investing in new technology. I am sure that all Committee members will closely watch its progress.<br><br>
The purpose of the duty cut is to help to continue the funding for the Football Trust and the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, It is right to say that both organisations are highly valued by all hon. Members. The Football Trust has done a great deal of important work to implement the Taylor report. I know that that work is also closely followed.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
We were able to agree with the pools promoters that they will continue to provide funding until at least March 2001. After March 2001, any pools company that wants to withdraw from the agreement will give 12 months' notice, effectively guaranteeing payments until March 2002.1 am pleased that our achievements have been greeted with approval on both sides of the Committee.</span></p>

RATES OF GAMING DUTY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to express the Opposition's support for clause 7, which would not have existed without our activities during the proceedings of last year's Finance Bill. The industry is important. Of the more than 100 casinos that operate in this country, about 20 are in London. The industry employs 12,000 people, of whom 4,000 work in London. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) explained during last year's Committee stage of the Finance Bill on the Floor of the House, the new higher rates of gaming duty introduced by that Bill were
<br><blockquote><p>"a dawn raid with a vengeance."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 28 April 1998; Vol. 311, c. 222.]</p></blockquote>
He urged the Government to give a commitment to index the bands of gross gaining yield on which the various rates had an impact. That was accepted by the Financial Secretary, who is now the Paymaster General, when she said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am persuaded that there is a case for creating an environment that allows the industry and its investors a reasonable level of certainty in which to operate and plan. Therefore, I am prepared to give a commitment to index the gaming duty bands for the remainder of this Parliament."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 28 April 1998; Vol. 311, c. 234.]</p></blockquote>
It is a pity that the hon. Lady was not able to accept my hon. Friend's amendment, which would have incorporated into statute the indexation of the bands as the now famous Rooker-Wise amendment incorporated into statute the indexation of personal allowances. As a tribute to my hon. Friend and the hon. Lady, the indexation of gaming duty could be called the Fallon-Primarolo commitment. Hon. Members will recall that the structure of the bands was changed and reduced from its original form as a result of representations by the industry and the Opposition, in particular my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor).<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
We welcome the clause and support indexation of the bands. However, it is a pity that it is indexing the huge tax hikes in last year's Finance Bill—another of the now infamous stealth taxes that the Government are imposing on this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton recalls the debate almost correctly. I was party to mat debate and supported the hon. Member for Sevenoaks in extracting that welcome concession from the Government.<br><br>
I would like to ask the Minister what the Government's policy is on gaming duties and their affect on the casino industry. The casino industry is especially important in London, which competes with other large cities around the world for an international clientele. The London casino industry has been hit in the last year or so as a result of the tax changes. Last year, when the then Financial Secretary discussed the Government's approach, it appeared that that approach was driven by considerations of revenue. She said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I shall continue to ensure that the forecast revenue yield on the measure is maintained."</p></blockquote>
She seemed to suggest that the policy would be determined by a forecast of revenue. I must therefore ask me Minister how the performance of the revenue yields compares with the relevant forecasts. Will she publish those forecasts, so that we can check whether they were too high or too low, and determine what the implications are for future tax policy?<br><br>
We should not view tax policy in isolation from the Government's other policy on the gaming and casino industry. Proposals are being considered by other Committees in the House for deregulation measures to enable casinos to obtain other revenues from their clients. For example, casinos might be permitted to have different types of fruit machines on the premises, which they are currently prevented from having. Will the Minister give us an idea of the progress on deregulation in the casino industry? It could be considered a quid pro quo if we allowed the Government to increase duties on the industry, while they were compensating it in other ways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the beginning of this debate, I hoped that we would get an unambiguous statement from the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, congratulating the Government, and I was going to say some terribly nice things about him. However, he was a little grudging, and I changed my mind. He them came up with a joke, which I thought was pretty good. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton seemed to put in a plea for an amendment to the joke, so that it would not simply be the Fallon-Primarolo amendment, but the Fallon-Primarolo-Davey amendment. I do not know whether he would press that to a vote. Perhaps, having made his point, he will not.<br><br>
When the House considered last year's Finance Bill in Committee, my predecessor—now the Paymaster General—promised to revalorise the duty bands for gaming duty during the life of this Parliament. As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton pointed out, that will be achieved by this year's measure and I am glad that it has received the support of both sides of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0068">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
Committee. Indexation of the bands means that casino operators will pay approximately £1 million less this year than would otherwise have been the case. The measure will therefore provide a fair and stable tax regime for the industry, giving it some security to plan for the future, amid the many changing factors that can affect its performance. I say to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton that it is not only taxation that affects the industry in London, but other factors, such as the difficulties experienced in some of the far eastern economies.<br><br>
Much has been said about last year's Finance Bill Committee, on which I did not, unfortunately, have the pleasure to serve. As you will know, Mr. Cook, we amended the duty band structure in the previous Finance Bill to help London casinos in the middle turnover range. It was a shame that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton did not mention that. The concession was worth £6 million—a figure that I did not hear from the hon. Gentleman—to casinos in London. The three per cent, reduction in corporation tax since we came to power will also reduce casinos' tax liabilities this year by £¾ million. Positive cash flow effects will also result from the abolition of advance corporation tax and the introduction of quarterly instalment payments for large companies.<br><br>
I can tell the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton that the Government keep rates of gaming duty and all other duties under constant review, although we consider the present level of taxation to be fair and appropriate.</span></p>

THE GENERAL RATE OF VEHICLE EXCISE DUTY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Guildford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 46, in page 3, line 25, after 'having', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'an engine powered by road fuel gas or'.</p></blockquote></span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin by lamenting the Government's failure to comply with even the simplest of their general election pledges. They promised that a Green Book as well as a Red Book would be produced for every Budget. This year, there is not even a green chapter. There are only five pages of text on green issues in a volume of 189 pages—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Brinton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Peterborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me make this point first. There are only five pages dealing with important environmental issues, and those are what the amendment addresses.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the hon. gentleman is raising important environmental issues, such as road fuel gas. As he will be aware, the Government cut duty on road fuel gas by 29 per cent, in the previous Budget, and I hope that there is a long-term commitment to supporting that environmentally friendly fuel. I am sure that the Treasury team is committed to that. It is a pleasure to find that the hon. Gentleman is so supportive of the Labour Government on this matter. Most of his colleagues are spending their time whingeing about the fuel escalator.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions must be brief. It appears that the hon. Lady is reading from a prepared text, which she may be able to present at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always a great pleasure to listen to the hon. Lady. I hope that her false start will not discourage her from making a full contribution to debate on this and other clauses. She almost took the words out of my mouth. We dealt with clause 2 on the Floor of the House, where it was well established that there had been a cut in duty. Committee members should be reminded why that cut in duty occurred. The smidgen about the environment in the Red Book—a paltry token, given the commitment to a Green Book—includes the two lines on page 78, which state that the Government's policy is
<br><blockquote><p>"encouraging the use of road fuel gases, which produce much lower emissions, especially of particulates, than conventional fuels".</p></blockquote>
I am hopeful about the Government's reception of the amendment. They clearly agree with Opposition Members that more action is required. Although the industry made strong representations to the Government, to which the Government clearly listened, as they reduced the duty, further action is necessary.<br><br>
The British Oxygen Company, which is based in my constituency, played a leading role in developing liquid petroleum gas, the most widely know form of road fuel gas and the sort that is most likely to be commercially viable in future. Also in my constituency is the Dennis bus company, which has expressed an interest in using road gas fuel engines in its vehicles. I therefore have a constituency interest in seeing the Government take this further.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
Since the industry made its representations, naturally some months before the Budget was presented, there has been a notable change in the situation because the company that was developing LPG engines, Perkins Engines, has been taken over by Caterpillar. As a result, the research and development work, which is an important part of the programme, has been halted. I hope that it has been halted only temporarily while the new owners of Perkins Engines investigate the validity of its research and development expenditure, but, because of that, it is very important that the Government should give a clear signal of their commitment to the use of that sort of road fuel. If they do not, there is a real risk that the whole project might flounder for a considerable time without expenditure on research and development, and Caterpillar may decide that the game is not worth the candle.<br><br>
I welcome the reduction in duty on road fuel gas, which, I believe, is worth 6p a litre. That means that fuel savings on a typical car, driven 15,000 miles a year, will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0069">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
be about £100 a year. However, that must be seen in the context of the cost of having an LPG tank in one's vehicle. I am advised by BOC that the additional capital cost of having a car that runs on that sort of fuel is £2,000. To spend an extra £2,000 in order to save £100 a year is not a financial proposition that even the Economic Secretary would consider to be a good deal. If she does, perhaps she is in the wrong job. We propose that there should be an additional saving of £135 a year for such vehicles by reducing the general rate from £155 to £20.<br><br>
I know that the Government are always, rightly, concerned about the cost of our proposals, and I would not pretend for one moment that cutting the rate of duty will increase the amount of revenue. There is a real cost to cutting this tax. This is the exception to the rule that I expounded at our first sitting last week. However, the cost is tiny. We know from an answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions that the cost of reducing the duty from £155 to £20 would be just £1 million a year. That is a measure of how few such vehicles there are on the roads.<br><br>
I now come to the heart of the case for taking this measure. For road fuel gas to become commercially viable, there needs to be a critical mass of cars using the road fuel gas. That is necessary to justify investment in the infrastructure, both for the companies producing the fuel and for the manufacturers producing the tanks, because the capital cost would fall if production levels were higher and, most importantly, the number of outlets would rise. At the moment, there are hardly any outlets for road fuel gas, and the industry says that that is the single most important restraining factor on growth in the use of that fuel and in the number of vehicles that use it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geraint Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that Government grants are available for converting lorries to take LPG? Why is the amendment not drafted in terms of subsidies for capital conversion? The essence of his argument revolves around capital conversion rather than running costs, which would mean an increasing burden on the Exchequer as the market sector takes off.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted with the help that I am receiving from Labour Members. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not be deterred from making his own contribution to our debates—but know from previous experience that, sadly, he is often far from deterred.<br><br>
I have a business in the west country, and last week we considered buying a new vehicle. We investigated the possibility of a vehicle powered by road fuel gas, but the grant provided by the Government is almost entirely offset by the fees that they charge for checking that the vehicle is roadworthy when the conversion has taken place. The grant is welcome, but it is not very helpful. After the grant and the cost of testing, £2,000 represents the net capital cost to those who want one of those vehicles. The economics do not stack up.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
On the merits of the case, it must be conceded that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I must make some progress—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I know that the hon. Gentleman is keen to make a contribution and I am grateful for his support for my amendment. I hope that I can persuade him that it represents the right way to go, but perhaps he will allow me to make the case. We can then hear his alternative proposals, although I fear that they will cost even more than mine, and that his Front Bench will watch them carefully.<br><br>
We must consider the intrinsic merits of the case for road fuel gas. The Kyoto targets are not relevant because road fuel gas does not involve a reduction in CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions; indeed, it may involve an increase in some emissions. Only 20 per cent, of all CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions come from the transport sector, so 80 per cent, come from other sectors. Real dedication to reducing those emissions will be shown when the Government encourage the growth of gas-fired power stations rather than entrenching coal-fired power stations, with their CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions. We must decide what target we want to reach. The way to reduce CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions is to tackle emissions in the power generation sector above all. The way to reduce particulate emissions and the emission of nitrous oxide is to encourage alternative fuels such as road fuel gas.<br><br>
It is part of the Government's agenda to encourage ultra-low sulphur diesel, but that also has drawbacks, and road fuel gas should be favoured. I should like Treasury Ministers to make a statement on the Government's preference between the various options for reducing emissions—for example, ultra-low sulphur diesel and road fuel gas. I look forward to the Minister's expertise being put to the test.<br><br>
Road gas fuel would provide some incidental benefits: engines that use road gas fuel are much quieter, and because of the lower level of particulates, that fuel is more acceptable in built-up environments. One of the arguments of the proponents of road fuel gas is that it is so much more friendly to city environments that transport that uses it might augur a complete rethink of traffic patterns in cities such as London. Some delivery vehicles might be encouraged to travel at times of the night when they are currently prohibited. If the road use patterns changed, we might avoid having to make too many changes to road infrastructure. As Committee members know, the most serious road congestion occurs at peak periods. We should encourage the use of new vehicles, especially at times when the roads would not otherwise be used. Adopting that imaginative and powerful strategy might have tremendous on-going benefits for our society.<br><br>
I notice that my right hon. and hon. Friends, and some Labour Members, want to speak, so I should conclude my remarks. In establishing a valid environmental strategy, we must take account of the Kyoto targets and national targets. Relevant targets are also buried somewhere in the Red Book. The Government said that road fuel gas would help in that regard. I hope that they will make clear their support for the programme, which may cost only £1 million. The programme may be about to suffer a setback at this critical moment, which might affect, for

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
example, the constituents of the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mrs. Brinton). The Government should give the proposal the time that it needs to prove itself and to get a critical mass behind the use of road fuel gas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) on the amendment. Unlike some subjects that we have discussed previously, and others to which we shall presently come this is not a party political issue. Committee members are unanimous about the desirability of promoting the use of LPG, which is a more environmentally benign fuel than those that are currently used.<br><br>
My hon. Friend made it clear that he embraced the Government's policy. We congratulate the Government on the steps that they have already taken to encourage the use of LPG, but they should acknowledge that they have not yet delivered their objective of encouraging greater market penetration and greater use of LPG. My hon. Friend said that the revenue cost of the proposal was estimated at less than £1 million, which underlines the fact that the Government's objective has not yet been delivered.<br><br>
The amendment proposes a way in which that objective could be delivered more effectively. My hon. Friend's suggestion that we should embrace the Government's objective is reasonable, and his suggestion that we should embrace the methods in the Bill is ultra-reasonable.<br><br>
The Chancellor said that there should be two classes of vehicle for the purposes of vehicle excise duty, and that conventionally powered vehicles of less than 1100 cc should be regarded as being more environmentally benign. However, my hon. Friend rightly pointed out that if that meant that a 25-year-old Fiat 850—an old banger—was regarded as being environmentally benign, we should also include in that class vehicles that are designed to use LPG, which the Government acknowledge is a more environmentally friendly fuel.<br><br>
I am sure that the Economic Secretary has in front of her a piece of paper about the amendment saying "resist". I expect—I speak with some experience—that that piece of paper will develop a line of argument to the effect "The Chancellor cannot possibly afford to shell out an extra £1 million to deliver this policy objective."<br><br>
The amendment provides the Economic Secretary with an opportunity to demonstrate her capacity for independent thought, although she need not say, "I shall overrule my officials and ignore their instruction to resist." She should simply tell the Committee that the Government will reflect on that line of argument and return to it on Report. We are not asking the Government to change their stated public objectives, which we recently restated in the Red Book; we are asking them to consider whether they are being met. The evidence put before the Economic Secretary will make it clear that they have yet to be met.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
The Bill contains proposals for the creation of a class of vehicle that will benefit from a concessionary rate of VED. Is not this a good opportunity for Ministers to consider ways in which that class might be enlarged to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
include vehicles that the Government agree are more deserving of a concessionary tax rate than the 25-year-old Fiat 850, which the Chancellor apparently believes to be a great environmental saviour?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will address in due course whether 1100 cc is the right threshold at which the rate of duty for cars should be reduced. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford on moving the amendment, which would encourage the use of LPG vehicles. I know of no environmentalist who would disagree with the view that—with the possible exception of nuclear fuel and moving to zero emissions of electricity—LPG is much more environmentally friendly than any other form of fuel. Indeed, the Government have recognised as much, because most of their own cars and dispatch agency vehicles now run on LPG.<br><br>
The industry is looking for a commitment from the Economic Secretary to maintain a medium and long-term strategy for encouraging LPG vehicles. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If she were to listen, the debate might progress a little further. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am now given to understand that it is the Financial Secretary who will respond to the debate. However, I stand by the observation that, were the Economic Secretary to listen, the debate might progress even further.<br><br>
There are 400,000 LPG road vehicles in Holland, 1 million in Italy, 350,00 in the USA and 330,000 in Australia. In France, buses, taxis and company cars fuelled by LPG are granted tax exemptions. It has been estimated that by the end of 1998 there would be 150,000 LPG vehicles in France, but only 7,780 in this country. If we seriously intend to help the environment, the Government must do much more to encourage the use of LPG vehicles.<br><br>
Marketline International, a polling company, estimates that the market for LPG vehicles in this country could rise to half a million by 2003, so there is huge potential for increased use. My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford mentioned the costs associated with conversion, but he did not mention those associated with the infrastructure. Unless the Government establish a medium and long-term framework, there will be no incentive to provide the infrastructure, the filling stations and the associated capital costs.<br><br>
Although the cut of 29p a hire is welcome, the amendment is sensible and I call on the Government to give the industry, which is listening carefully to our debate, some assurance that they are seriously committed to encouraging greater take-up of LPG vehicles over the medium term. There is no doubt that, in respect of almost every type of harmful emission from both petrol and diesel engines, LPG vehicles are more environmentally friendly. As my hon. Friend said, the engines are quieter, too.<br><br>
We know from the Office for National Statistics that some of our cities will have great difficulty in meeting sustainability targets for some emissions. For example, Belfast and Liverpool will have a problem with sulphur dioxide. The emission factor for petrol engines is 130, compared with 24 for LPG vehicles. London will have a problem with benzene and the oxides and nitrogens.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0071">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
Benzene is one of the most dangerous emissions because it is carcinogenic. The emission factor for LPG is 1.1, compared with 14 for petrol.<br><br>
There is a huge amount of environmental gain to be had from switching to LPG. Furthermore, that would help us to meet our international commitment on carbon dioxide emissions, which we made recently at Kyoto. The emission factor for petrol is 3, and for diesel it is 0.75; LPG is somewhere between petrol and diesel. In every sense there is a lot to be gained form introducing LPG vehicles, and I hope that the Government will embark on a programme not only to provide grants to industry for converting vehicles, but to ensure that inspection tests involve a minimum of bureaucracy and cost, that research is carried out to enable more engines to be introduced in this country and elsewhere, and that encouragement is given to setting up the infrastructure for LPG vehicles. If the Government do that, they will do much to help our environment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon Friend the Member for Guildford providing the opportunity to say a little more about LPG. When we debated clause 2 on the Floor of the House, I made it clear that the Opposition welcomed the cut in the duty on IPG and natural gas for vehicles. I can tell the hon. Member for Peterborough that the process was started under the previous Government. We began by reducing duty to encourage the take-up of LPG, and I am pleased that the present Government have decided to continue that process.<br><br>
I should declare a small interest because a few weeks ago I was given the opportunity of driving a Morgan fuelled by LPG round New Palace yard, which I believe was arranged by Calor Gas Ltd. Some people have doubted whether LPG provides the same performance as normal petrol-driven cars, and although I was unable to put the Morgan fully through its paces while going round New Palace yard—I had a close shave with my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle (Mr. Wardle)—it was impressive, and I am certainly a convert.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford referred to one of the main problems—the difficulty of refuelling with LPG. When discussing clause 2, I said that British Gas had closed eight fuel outlet points, including one in my constituency, and I shall take the opportunity to refer to that again.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold said that although the reduction in duty is welcome, it is important to encourage further take-up and to provide the industry with some certainty about the medium-term prospects. On clause 2 we asked the Minister whether the Government would undertake to maintain the reduction in duty on LPG in future Budgets, but we spent most of the time debating other issues and she was unable to deal with that point. It would be welcome if she would now say a little about the Government's future intentions with regard to encouraging take-up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geraint Davies: It</span><span class='membercontribution'> is amazing that the Opposition, having abandoned their commitment to the escalator on petrol, suddenly put on green clothes and now say that they would spend more and more money on greater subsithes for LPG.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
Like the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, I have driven a Morgan and I have a photograph of it; it may be the very same Morgan. The number of people driving such cars has doubled year on year but, as the hon. Member for Cotswold said, the number of LPG cars in Britain is remarkably low. It is clear from the recent Budget and previous Budgets, and from general announcements, that the Government are moving forward, particularly given our ambitious Kyoto targets. Anyone in industry who looks at market development in Britain and Europe would be wise to invest now in a green future, which includes LPG. I have no doubt that the big oil companies will move forward with LPG.<br><br>
There is a question mark over the amendment, given the Opposition's desire to give away money by abolishing the escalator. They want to pump more and more money into achieving objectives that the market is beginning to deliver. We have sent signals to the market and continue to give incentives to consumers. I welcome the 29p incentive in the Budget.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaun Woodward <span class='memberconstituency'>(Witney)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman can make sense of what seems to be a contradiction in the Bill. The Government say that they will cut vehicle excise duty for cars with a small engine capacity, yet the hon. Gentleman resists my hon. Friend's amendment. Will he explain that apparently incoherent position?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I tried to explain the difference in a previous intervention. There is a difference between running costs and capital costs, and the overheads of the capital costs include VED. In the past the Government have provided subsidies for conversion, and now we are introducing a running-cost deduction. There are always debates on whether VED should be reduced. The Government have already been asked to consider that. The Government continue to monitor, develop and evolve their green policy on fuel and cars. Presumably they will continue to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman might want to make it clear to the Committee that he prefers to encourage the introduction of LPG cars with grant assistance rather than with tax reductions. That is not the line taken by his hon. Friends on the Front Bench.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I prefer a rationally mixed portfolio of capital and running-cost incentives, depending on how the market develops and with a view to the future needs of the Exchequer. Those instruments must be balanced, not set down simplistically in black and white.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, should declare that I had the pleasure not of driving, but at least of sitting in a gas-powered motor car that had been equipped by DG Technology in my neighbouring constituency of Loughborough. It was an excellent car. I should also declare that my Government car, and those of several of my right hon. and hon. friends, will be converted to LPG later this year.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
The hon. Member for Guildford made an interesting and occasionally entertaining speech. He began, perhaps less than graciously, by criticising me environmental information made available in this year's Red Book. I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that in this year's Red Book we have given far more information on environmental measures and the environmental impact of Budget measures than has ever been given by the present or previous Governments, whether in the Red Book or the "Pre-Budget Report". We said last year that we wanted to build on the environmental information given in the Budget and the "Pre-Budget Report".<br><br>
We have done that, which was consistent with the fact that this year's Budget contained the most far-reaching and radical programme of environmental tax reforms that we have ever seen. The package of measures and the information that we gave in the environmental assessment in the Red Book have been welcomed by the Select Committee and by environmental groups. We are happy to consider constructive suggestions about how we can build on that information. If the hon. gentleman wishes to contribute to that, I will consider his suggestions carefully.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised the important issue of the Government's attitude to different fuels, and what our objectives should be in promoting the use of different fuels to achieve the environmental objectives that I think we all share. We have to balance our climate change objectives and the need to reduce the COstanding 1<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions produced by sectors of the economy, including the road transport sector, against the need to reduce particulates and the other emissions that are so damaging to local air quality, which we must do to meet our national air quality targets. We balance those two objectives and keep the situation under close review.<br><br>
However, as the hon. Member for Cotswold said, although diesel delivers lower CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions for each kilometre driven, ordinary diesel delivers higher particulates, which worsen local air quality. That is one reason why we introduced the differential for ultra-low sulphur diesel, which has been enormously successful. In comparison with ordinary diesel, ULSD substantially cuts the emission of particulates and other forms of local air pollutants. That differential, like the differential introduced by the previous Government for unleaded petrol, has been so successful that nearly 100 per cent, of the diesel market will soon be taken by ULSD.<br><br>
The general attitude is not to say that road fuel gases, whether they are LPG or compressed natural gas, are always to be preferred to other forms of road fuel, but to look at the different balance of fuels that will best achieve the objectives of the Kyoto targets, the CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emission target and the local air quality target.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Guildford and others made an important point about the infrastructure needed to ensure that drivers who convert to gas-powered vehicles can obtain the gas for their cars. Several hon. Members suggested mat the proposed cut in VED was necessary to get the market to respond and roll out the infrastructure. That argument does not stand up.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
Shell UK and BP recently made the welcome announcement that they would implement major investment programmes to ensure that there is a network of LPG sites on forecourts throughout the United Kingdom. In particular, Shell UK announced a £10 million investment programme designed to make auto LPG available to 80 per cent, of motorists by 2001. Its key aims are to have 300 of its forecourts dispensing LPG within the next five years, and 75 sites on line by the millennium. That investment in infrastructure is happening without the proposed VED cut.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Casale<span class='memberconstituency'>(Wimbledon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, I have not found time in my busy schedule to drive around the House of Commons in a Morgan powered by LPG. However, I recently drove round my constituency in an LPG car owned and run by Merton council. Will my hon. Friend confirm that local authorities have an important role to play in promoting the use of more environmentally friendly cars? Perhaps Opposition Members can encourage some of the new Conservative authorities to do the same.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. He is right—there is already a significant programme of investment and conversion to gas-fuel powered cars by local authorities, bus operators and other large fleet operators. That is welcome, and my hon. Friend is right to suggest that Opposition members who support our objective of encouraging the use of cleaner fuels should ensure that their own local authorities are taking appropriate measures.<br><br>
The Government share the objective of encouraging the use of cleaner fuels, and we are taking steps to ensure that that take-up happens. It is because of those steps that the private sector investments to which I referred are already being made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary tell us how many years it would take someone who has spent £2,000 converting his car to recoup that added investment through the lower rate of duty proposed in the Bill, without the benefit of the additional cut in vehicle excise duty that we are proposing, assuming that he drove an average number of miles per year in a typical car?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that any large vehicle that is gas-fuel operated would almost certainly qualify for a reduced pollution certificate. It would then be entitled, under our proposal to a reduction in vehicle excise duty of £1,000 a year—a reduction that has been doubled in this Budget.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my question was not clear. I was referring to ordinary cars, which are subject to the general rate of duty. That is what this clause—and the amendment—deal with, not heavy-duty vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me a second opportunity to answer the question. I observe—I think that my arithmetic is correct—that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0073">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
vehicle excise duty reduction of £100 proposed in his amendment would mean that it would take about 20 years to recoup the £2,000 invested in the conversion.<br><br>
The point that I was making in response to both the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members was that the absence of an infrastructure has been the major factor in holding back demand for gas-fuel powered vehicles. That infrastructure problem will be solved as the investments being made by Shell and BP roll out. Those companies rightly anticipate a substantial growth in this market, regardless of the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Guildford.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Cawsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Goole)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no personal experience of LPG, but my neighbour converted his car just before the Budget. He informed me that he expects to recoup the conversion cost over two or three years, and that time will now be halved as a result of the Chancellor's Budget statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a telling point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geraint Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be naive to do a simple calculation involving the sums of £100 and £2,000 and a period of 20 years? One must also consider the relative cost of running a petrol-driven car, the impact of the escalator and the changes per mile in terms of fuel costs. In those wider terms, it is clear that rational consumers will move into this market much faster than the somewhat naive analysis of the hon. Member for Guildford would suggest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The investments that BP and Shell are making illustrate that this market is growing in response to the measures already taken by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give way one more time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point because we have given the Economic Secretary the chance to get help from her hon. Friends to answer a fundamental question, to which the Government really should know the answer. Will she confirm that she does not know how long it would take a typical car driver to recover the cost of investing in an LPG fuel tank as a result of the modest savings put forward by the Government? She simply does not know the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already answered the hon. Gentleman's question twice. The Government are taking effective measures to encourage the use of road fuel gases. In the Budget, we cut duty on those gases by 29 per cent, compared with the real increase in both petrol and diesel duty. That duty differential is now one of the largest in Europe, the duty being only a fifth of the duty on diesel.<br><br>
Having welcomed the cut in gas duty, the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford asked whether the Government were committed to maintaining
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
the differential. Let me repeat the assurance given by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor: we will maintain the differential between duty on road fuel gases and that on diesel, at least for the lifetime of this Parliament. That commitment gives both drivers and the industry the stability that they need to encourage them to make the necessary investments.<br><br>
I also draw to the Committee's attention the existence of the DETR-funded Powershift programme, which, as the right hon. Member for Charnwood mentioned, makes grants available to help cover the additional purchasing costs of gas-powered vehicles, and indeed electric vehicles, in order further to stimulate the market for alternative-fuelled vehicles. I believe that that programme is successful, especially in helping larger operators to meet the cost of conversion or purchase of such vehicles.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood, who is only too familiar with official briefings for Finance Bills, suggested that I had been briefed to resist the amendment on the ground of cost. Of course, the costs would be very small, for the simple reason that the take-off in the market has not yet occurred. But that is not why I am resisting the amendment. The amendment is unnecessary to secure the investment in infrastructure that is the essential precondition for a take-off in gas-powered cars. That investment is already taking place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Economic Secretary answer one simple question? Are the Government satisfied with the pace of advance of the use of LPG and other road fuel gases?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We want the take-up of gas-powered vehicles to happen as fast as it possibly can, but as I have argued, and as other Committee members have argued, the biggest barrier to take-up is the lack of refuelling infrastructure. If one cannot fill one's car with gas, one is unlikely to purchase a gas-powered car or to convert one's present car. Those investment decisions have now been made. Conversion of forecourt pumps is now under way and will come on stream rapidly. I am pleased with that progress and hope that it will be welcomed by the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary say what percentage of Shell's annual spend on forecourt investment is its £10 million forecourt conversion programme?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know. Shell estimates—<i>[Interruption.]</i>—I am not responsible for Shell's investment programme. I hope that the hon. Gentleman shares my interest in the fact that the investment of £10 million could deliver LPG to 80 per cent, of motorists by 2001, which is an extensive and rapid approach. I believe, and Shell clearly believes, that that would have a significant effect on the use of LPG-powered vehicles.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the clause is meant to encourage behavioural change in our purchasing decisions about smaller cars. Do not the Government want to bring
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0074">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
about a causal, behavioural change in the purchase of LPG vehicles? If so, what is the Economic Secretary's estimate of the cost of the amendment and of the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Guildford rightly said that, given the current level of use of gas-powered vehicles, the amendment would cost £1 million a year. That figure is very low, but it reflects the fact that there is a small take-up of such vehicles. My point—I have made it several times, but I am not sure that the hon. Member for Cotswold was listening—is that the real barrier that prevents ordinary drivers from purchasing or converting to a gas-powered car is the fact that the infrastructure is not available to allow them to refuel the car easily, although the necessary investment is under way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Economic Secretary is not responsible for Shell's investment programme, but she is responsible for the clause. I sympathise with her for not knowing the answer to the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford, who asked how long it would take the owner of a converted car to recoup his £2,000 capital investment from the reductions in the duty on LPG. However, she is responsible for matters relating to vehicle excise duty, and she should be able to tell us whether the Government have assessed the figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have examined the combination of incentives that will encourage the purchase of, or conversion to, cleaner vehicles and a greater reliance on cleaner fuel. The clause is part of that overall strategy, as are the various proposals to which I have referred.<br><br>
We have other reasons for resisting the amendment. First—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Should I take it from that response that the Economic Secretary does not know whether the Government have assessed the figures? I appreciate that she may not know the results of that assessment—complicated calculations are involved—but is not it rather odd for her not to know whether the Treasury has carried out an assessment in an area for which she is responsible?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there is further information that I can supply to the hon. Gentleman in this regard, I shall do so. We have cut the duty on the relevant gases by 29 per cent., and we have ensured that this country will have the biggest differentials in the European Union. We, and the market, are confident that that will assist in the take-up of gas-powered cars.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I have given way on several occasions, and I want to make progress.<br><br>
The first reason why Committee members should resist the amendment is that it is not necessary to generate such investment in the infrastructure, and the second reason is that, although gas-powered vehicles produce fewer local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
air pollutants, they damage the roads and produce CO2 emissions. They should therefore bear the cost of VED in the same way as other vehicles.<br><br>
I have already referred to the Powershift programme, as well as to the substantial cut, which was doubled in this Budget, for the larger vehicles that operate on cleaner fuels. That will be kept under review as we monitor the impact of the 29 per cent, differential in fuel duties that we introduced to assist in the take-up of gas fuel-powered cars. I will also continue to monitor the impact of the private sector investment programme to which I referred.<br><br>
I therefore hope that the hon. Member for Guildford will feel able to withdraw the amendment. If he presses the amendment to a vote, I shall ask my hon. Friends to oppose it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Government's important concession that they will maintain the differential between this type of fuel and others throughout this Parliament. I would not want the Economic Secretary to think me ungracious, so I shall withdraw my amendment, which has served its purpose by revealing the ignorance and indifference of Labour Members.<br><br>
I have every sympathy with the hon. Member for Peterborough, in whose constituency Perkins Engines is based. It is a fine firm, which I visited some years ago. Its research and development facilities are outstanding. Many people in her constituency will be sorry to see that she has been busy with other affairs while the future of an important research project involving LPG—in which BOC, in my constituency, is also involved—is at stake following the takeover of the company.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a moment. That important research and development programme is in jeopardy and the Government's attitude will have an important bearing on whether Caterpillar, the new owners of the company in her constituency, proceed with that project.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I need take no lectures from the hon. Gentleman about Perkins in my constituency, nor about anything else in my constituency. My commitment to LPG and my knowledge of the matter have been made public today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the hon. Lady feels that she knows so much about the subject that she does not have to listen to the debate. That puts her on a par with the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey), who thinks that he can rely on his neighbour's information as a guide to Government policy. I do not know how many hundreds of thousands of miles his neighbour drives in a year and a half, but he is clearly not an environmentally friendly person.<br><br>
As a result of those hon. Members' interventions, we discovered that the Government do not have a clue about how much the reduction in fuel duty for road fuel gas will assist those who have to pay the conversion cost of £2,000, as they have not done the necessary research.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I0075">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
That shows a shocking degree of ignorance and a cavalier attitude. The Government are prepared to give away money without knowing what effect it will have.<br><br>
It is not sufficient for the Economic Secretary to tell us that BP will adjust the fuel provision on 300 of its forecourts, or that Shell will spend £10 million doing the same. The statistic that 80 per cent, of cars would then be able to reach such stations is fairly meaningless—the typical car has a range of 200 or 300 miles in its fuel tank. The idea that, by plotting their routes around the country strategically to reach each BP and Shell fuel station, people will just manage to get their cars there before they run out of fuel, shows the Government's lack of understanding. There are thousands of forecourts around the country. Although I welcome the investment in infrastructure by Shell and BP, it is a fraction of what is needed if the issue is to be seriously addressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give way if the hon. Lady's intervention is more productive and constructive than her previous comment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to tell the hon. Gentleman that my intervention will be more informed than his contribution. Is he aware that both Calor and Shell said that this Government have done more for LPG in one stroke in this Budget than any other Government in history? They agreed that we have given LPG the biggest and most productive boost ever. What does he have to say about that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: LPG has not been around throughout history. As we approach the millennium, other measures will have a greater impact.<br><br>
Had the hon. Member for Peterborough listened to the debate, she would have heard me welcome the reduction in duty, which has pleased a firm in my constituency. However, she ignores what is happening on her own doorstep. One of the prime movers in the project has decided, despite the fact that the Chancellor announced a reduction in fuel duty in the Budget, to spend no more on research and development while it reviews whether the project is worth while. The debate has moved on. Although the change in duty is welcome, the research and development programme in the hon. Lady's constituency has been frozen. She should be aware that no matter how many plaudits the Government have won, representations were made to them months before the Budget. Events have moved on and they are not responding to them today.<br><br>
We estimated that the typical investor in an LPG fuel tank would save £100 a year from the Government's reduction in duty. We proposed an additional saving of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
£135 by reducing the duty from £155 to £20. The Government's proposal on LPG is a sop, because according to their own figures, it will take 20 years of car use to recoup the cost of investing in an LPG fuel tank. We are being more realistic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.Geraint Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not.<br><br>
I welcome the fact that the Economic Secretary has promised to keep the issue under review. I hope that she will go away and do her homework properly because she had not done so this morning. I also hope, given what is said in the Red Book and this commitment, that real progress will be made before the research and development programme that is in the constituency of the hon. Member for Peterborough is knocked on the head because of lack of action by her Government and the indifference that she, as its Member of Parliament, has shown this morning.</span></p>
