	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Lansley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to serve on a Standing Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Welsh. Given your interest in business matters, our proceedings will be of some interest to you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's purpose, which I hope was well explained on Second Reading—several members of the Committee were present and had an opportunity to hear about it—is to control the use of the title "chamber of commerce" and of related titles. We are not setting out to regulate the activities of chambers of commerce. They are a set of private law bodies, which undertake public and private sector partnership activity, and some strictly private sector activities. We do not propose to move to public law status. However, given the character of chambers of commerce overseas and in this country, there is every reason to control the title so that it is used only when it is right to do so—by bodies that have the essential characteristics of chambers of commerce and which fit the right description.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 requires the Secretary of State to include the title "chamber of commerce" in the list of controlled titles. Nothing currently prevents the Secretary of State from doing that—indeed, he does so. Under clause 1, however, no Secretary of State could cease to include "chamber of commerce" and related titles among those that are controlled under the Companies Act 1985 and the Business Names Act 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 2 and 3 stand alongside, and give effect to clause 1. Clause 2 relates to the Companies Act, while clause 3 relates to business names. Sections 26 and 29 of the Companies Act—I will not detain the Committee by reading them out—set out how the Secretary of State may ensure that, where controlled titles apply, only those titles that accurately describe a body can be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
A difficulty has, however, emerged over time. The Secretary of State is able to refuse the use of a title, including a controlled title, only when it is the same as another body's title or does not accurately reflect a body's character. Several cases have illustrated the point. One related to geographic descriptors. The East of London chamber of commerce and the East London chamber of commerce both sought the use of a title. There is also the case of the use of the Kent chamber title. There have been difficulties because the Secretary of State has received objections from the British Chambers of Commerce to the use of a title, but has been unable to prevent it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 would give the Secretary of State additional power to include in the list the title "chamber of commerce" and related titles, and to issue guidance on factors that should be brought to bear. Those would relate not only to whether a body describes itself as a chamber of commerce in its memorandum and articles of association, but to whether it genuinely represents a chamber of commerce in its activity, structure, and representation of functions. Those factors—this is possibly the most critical aspect of the entrenchment of this change in legislation—will relate also to whether a body's geographic descriptor is accurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 contains the same power, but in relation to the Business Names Act. It may be helpful to refer to one point that was made on Second Reading. The Bill does not give power to the Secretary of State to require the abandonment of a title. Companies legislation provides a test. The Secretary of State can require a body to change its name if he believes that its title is no longer appropriate under companies legislation, that it is misleading and that it would cause actual harm to anyone misled by it. I am happy—as I hope the Committee is—to rest on that tough test of harm. It will enable the Secretary of State to use section 32 of the Companies Act to require a company to change the title of chamber of commerce if it does not meet the requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was mentioned on Second Reading, clause 4 gives the Secretary of State power to consult relevant representative bodies. The power is flexibile, and I hope that it will be possible to look to the Training and Enterprise Councils National Council and to other bodies as relevant bodies, as chambers of commerce are increasingly merging with other bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On clause 5, will the Minister give a commitment that the Secretary of State will bring the legislation into force no later than the first time following the Bill's enactment that he is minded to issue regulations under section 29 of the Companies Act or section 3 of the Business Names Act? That will ensure that such regulations could not be promulgated without including the title of chamber of commerce as a relevant controlled title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should mention the extent of the provisions. The practice under current companies legislation is that provisions affecting Northern Ireland are not included in primary legislation, but are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
subsequently dealt with by secondary legislation. Will the Minister further confirm that the Government will take the same approach concerning the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Brake 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wellington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Welsh. For my own information and future reference, will you clarify the seating arrangements in the Room? I am slightly confused by seeing Opposition and Government Members sitting the same side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill's promoter is sitting next to the Minister because the Committee is considering a private Member's Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Guildford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sitting on the same side of the Committee as my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) to give him moral support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Pound 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the seating arrangements were social rather than political.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Wills)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warmly congratulate the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire on his success in the ballot, and welcome the Bill's successful Second Reading. The Government believe that the Bill should be supported. It is pleasing to note that it has support from all parties, which, as has just been said, is graphically demonstrated in the Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill would achieve the aims of which the promoter has given a good and succinct account, so I do not intend to rehearse them. The British Chambers of Commerce and the Scottish Chambers of Commerce are valued partners in a number of key Government initiatives that are intended to support the business community. I refer to business links, to the export research scheme and to trade promotion efforts. The British Chambers of Commerce has continuously and enthusiastically worked to introduce an accreditation system to raise standards across the network to the highest level of the best. The Government believe that statutory recognition of the titles of "chamber of commerse" and of "chamber of trade" and other similar titles will provide a morale boost—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.38 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>4.53 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Division, I congratulated the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire on the Bill, and was explaining that the British Chambers of Commerce and the Scottish Chambers of Commerce are highly valued partners in key Government initiatives to support the business community, such as business link, the export research scheme and trade promotion efforts. The BBC has continually and enthusiastically worked to introduce an accreditation system to raise standards across the network to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
highest level of the best. Statutory recognition of the titles "chamber of commerce", "chamber of trade" and so on will give a morale boost to the cause of quality support to businesses. The Bill is a fine example of how the Government and the Opposition can work as partners in support of the business community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I commend the Bill to the Committee, I shall address two points that were raised by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire. First, it will be for the new Northern Ireland Executive to put forward for consideration by the Northern Ireland Assembly any legislative action in this area. Secondly, the Bill will be commenced by order so that it is brought into effect at the same time as the relevant regulations. That will happen as soon as possible. On that basis, I am delighted to commend the Bill to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Cotter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Weston-super-Mare)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate you, Mr. Welsh, on the brisk way in which you have conducted the Committee. Having attended the previous debate I am pleased to follow up by supporting the initiative. The well known and highly regarded Bristol chamber of commerce, which is near my constituency, supports the Bill. So I wish briefly to express my support and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) for the Bill, and to leave it at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lansley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister and to the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) for their support, and to all members of the Committee. I am also grateful to the Minister for his useful confirmation about commencement. I hope that when the Bill comes back, right hon. and hon. Members will agree that we have dealt with the points raised on Second Reading. As I recall, there were really only two. One was whether the Secretary of State should also have the power to order the abandonment of the chamber of commerce title. I hope that right hon. and hon. Members will understand, when the Bill returns to the Floor, that no such power has been included because it would not be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have retained in the Bill discretion for the Secretary of State to issue guidance. That is another point that I should have raised with the Minister. However, given the Government's support for the Bill, I am sure that when the time comes, Ministers will issue guidance on which factors the Secretary of State should take into account in assessing chamber of commerce or related titles as names for companies or businesses. That will be done, I am sure, in conjunction with the chambers of commerce, with a view to reflecting those factors which will be understood by the general business community to represent the activities, character and proper geographic descriptors of a chamber of commerce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
