	<div class='clause'>Clause 5</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>BEST VALUE REVIEWS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Essex)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak against clause 5. It will be useful to discuss the clause as a whole, not least because our amendment was ill framed. We wanted to consider the performance of best value authorities and framing best value authorities and framing best value reviews.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We thought that the Bill was meant to reflect the White Paper's provisions on fundamental performance review. I shall recap, and give the Committee our interpretation of the relevant provisions of the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 7.18 of the White Paper provides the most concrete statement about the purpose of performance reviews. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The principal outcome of each review will therefore be performance targets which take account of national requirements for the service (s) concerned—covering strategic objectives, cost and efficiency, effectiveness, quality and fair access—and an action plan demonstrating how those targets are to be achieved."</p></blockquote>
The White Paper goes on to explain the four key processes that will help authorities to form a best value review. Paragraph 7.19 states that they include the challenge of providing services,
	<br><blockquote><p>"in entirely new ways. New technology or best practice may meand that traditional ways of providing a service are no longer viable or acceptable".</p></blockquote>
That is reflected in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of subsection (4), which provides for an authority,
	<br><blockquote><p>"to consider whether it should be exercising the function; to consider the level at which and the way in which it should be exercising the function; to consider its objectives in relation to the exercise of the function".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 7.20 of the White Paper deals with comparison. It considers national performance indicators and benchmarking clubs. I am a bit suspicious of benchmarking clubs because they are mutually comfortable places where people can compare their attributes without the threat of having
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
to change anything. It is encouraging that the White Paper recommends that comparisons should go beyond local authorities,
	<br><blockquote><p>"to embrace the experience of other public and voluntary bodies and the private sector."</p></blockquote>
Clearly, comparison should be fruitful for many local authorities. However, I am not sure whether it would give them the impetus to do something about failing public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third process that the White Paper describes is consultation. The Bill provides for making comparisons, but mixes up comparing and consulting. For example, subsection (4) (f) requires local authorities,
	<br><blockquote><p>"to consult other best value authorities and commercial and other businesses about the exercise of the function".</p></blockquote>
However, the White Paper treats the matter as one of engaging with local communities and carrying out reviews. I do not want to hark back unnecessarily to a previous debate, but the White Paper states that the consultation should be in the review process, whereas the Bill suggests that the only consultation would be with other best value authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real question that we want to raise is that of competitiveness. The Bill gives little indication of how competition should be provided for in conducting a best value review. Of course, competition was what so many authorities most resented on the introduction of compulsory competitive tendering. Getting rid of those rules was in many ways the motive for the Government and many of their supporters in introducing the best value process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4)(e) refers to assessment of the competitiveness of an authority's
	<br><blockquote><p>"performance in exercising the function by reference to the exercise of the same function, or similar functions, by other best value authorities and by commercial and other businesses".</p></blockquote>
but that is all that it says. It is difficult to understand, harking back to what my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr Curry) is always going on about, what that provision means to someone who gets in at 9 o'clock in the morning and must provide for competition. Is it just another form of benchmarking—in which case those concerned can all go back to bed again after 5 o'clock without doing anything about it—or is there a degree of compulsion? The whole Bill is, of course, deeply imbued with the philosophy of central compulsion from Whitehall, as the hon. Member for Bow and Poplar—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—for Bethnal Green and Stepney, or rather the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King), the boundaries of whose constituency have obviously been subject to a best value review, will acknowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clues about what those concerned will have to do are in the White Paper. There is lots of rhetoric about providing
	<br><blockquote><p>"a competitive economy with a flexible labour market, underpinned by the fair treatment of those affected"</p></blockquote>
and we should all sign up to that. The document contains the ritual complaint about
	<br><blockquote><p>"the imposition of rules which invite avoidance"—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0824">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
that is a criticism of compulsory competitive tendering—and there is preference for an
	<br><blockquote><p>"approach based on partnership rather than confrontation".</p></blockquote>
Competitive tendering always worked best where local authorities undertook it in a spirit of partnership. Where it was undertaken adversarially it was—and will remain—pretty easy for local authorities to frighten away potential bidders for contracts, whose reaction would be, "We don't want to work with them; they look like a nightmare to work for." That is how competitive tendering failed to achieve the results that we wanted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Oona King 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bethnal Green and Bow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An example of what I hope we shall be leaving behind, and what the Bill purports to bring about, occurred in my constituency. The council, under CCT, contracted out the maintenance and repairs service. The lowest bid won, because that was the only factor that was really allowed to be taken into account. The cowboy contractors who won the bid were unable to carry out all the work they were contracted to do. The council then had to pay twice and a constituent of mine has been waiting five years for work to be done. That arrangement was neither efficient nor effective, but it failed not because it was not entered into a spirit of partnership but because at that point CCT was able to take into account only one factor. It cost the council double, which surely is not what the hon. Gentleman would want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept that, but just as in buying a house or second-hand car, one can be done. An authority that was skilled at competitive tendering would have framed the contract to make sure that the cowboys were frozen out of the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mole Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the example, and I suspect that the local authority was Tower Hamlets, which was not renowned for its competence. Partnership is required, and that means on both sides. The local authority has to be competent in the way that it draws up the contract and sets the specifications. Under CCT, which is still current, it does not, as the hon. Lady stated, have to choose the lowest bid. Knowing Tower Hamlets as I did in the past, I suspect that the blame lies solidly on that local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I totally agree with that analysis. The giveaway in the hon. Lady's comments was when she said that one really has to accept the lowest bid. That is not so. "Really" is always a giveaway that something is not the case. The lowest tender need not be accepted if there are good reasons. The local authority should have shown the Government that this was a cowboy operation that was not capable of fulfilling the contract. That should not have been difficult to do; the private sector likes to let contracts to other companies and it can spot the cowboys and can justify its actions to its accountants. Other local authorities have managed to avoid those pitfalls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
It is sad that the adversarial nature of competitive tendering has been preserved by those councils that were inherently hostile to the principle in the first place. The only thing that can be said for the Bill is that those councils which were determined to get round, or to spite themselves through, the competitive tendering process, are going to be hoist by their own petard because the Bill gives the Secretary of State far more powers to intervene in those cases than competitive tendering ever provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the White Paper, it contains lots of good stuff. It is good advertising copy for the Government's other policies. But then we come to the question of competition and how it will be applied. The White Paper spends a lot of time discussing all the employment measures, "Fairness at Work", the working time and young workers directives, acquired rights directives and transfer undertakings which have ameliorated the effects of competitive tendering on employees. Many of us would accept that that is probably rather a good thing. We are not against fairness for employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measures are all in there because the Government want to advertise why they are so keen on them before they go on to the next bit. The next bit is more interesting. Paragraph 7.27 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The key test is which of the options"—</p></blockquote>
in a strategic choice to provide services in-house or not—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is likely to secure the best value for local people. Services should not be delivered directly if other more efficient and effective means are available. The Government"—</p></blockquote>
listen to this—
	<br><blockquote><p>"will issue guidance which will explain the factors that should be considered in making such a choice."</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether it would have made any difference if the rules on competitive tendering had been laid down by guidance or by order. The fact is that there are to be some rules to provide for competitive tendering that will effectively make it an obligation on the council to accept a substantially cheaper or better value bid from the private sector than from the public sector. Am I wrong? I will give way to the Minister if she wants to intervene. No. she is stunned into silence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is competitive tendering being abolished? Paragraph 7.28 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The guidance will emphasise that retaining work in-house without subjecting it to real competitive pressure can rarely be justified."</p></blockquote>
I should have expected the hon. Member for Bow and Stepney to be on her feet again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Oona King</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bethnal Green and Bow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Lady. Bethnal Green and Bow—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—or representing the local authority of Tower Hamlets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 7.28 continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Should an authority exercise that choice and the service fail to provide best value, continuing in-house provision would not be sustainable."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0825">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
The Opposition are agreed on that but it is questionable whether Labour Members are agreed on that in view of all the powers that have been given to the Secretary of State to enforce that unsustainability. The paragraph continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The guidance will also include provision for transparency and robust cost apportionment in accounting practice to ensure that options are assessed on an equal footing and that the role and contribution of trading to best value is clear."</p></blockquote>
We all agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key point is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In addition, the Government will continue to take firm and swift action against any authority that provides a service to itself, or to others, at a trading loss".</p></blockquote>
That is reminiscent of the powers exercised for a considerable time by Conservative Secretarys of State over inefficient local authorities. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where authorities have incurred significant or sustained deficits on providing services directly, the Government will not hesitate to use its powers to instruct a council to make alternative provision for its services."</p></blockquote>
That is welcome, but whether it is what Labour Members would have expected to find in a Government White Paper and to be reflected in a local government Bill put forward by a new Labour Government is quite another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some ameliorating passages in the following paragraph 7.29, which provides for various options relating to the requirement to use and develop competition. It mentions commissioning
	<br><blockquote><p>"an independent benchmarking report"—</p></blockquote>
we are back to the vagueness of benchmarking—providing "a core service in-house" and buying
	<br><blockquote><p>"top-up support from the private sector",</p></blockquote>
which can have advantages and disadvantages. Other options are to
	<br><blockquote><p>"contract out a service to the private sector after a competition for external bidders only"—</p></blockquote>
precisely what the Labour party used to be against—and to
	<br><blockquote><p>"form a joint venture or partnership following a competition from an external partner".</p></blockquote>
We shall come later to provisions to involve local authorities more in commercial activities that are not core to their business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most interesting of all is the proposal to
	<br><blockquote><p>"tender part of a service with an in-house team bidding against the private sector and other local authority bidders, before deciding whether to provide the bulk of a service internally or externally."</p></blockquote>
I am bound to say that if we want transparency, clarity and enforcement, moving the goalposts half way through the bidding process so that contractors do not know what they are bidding for is unlikely to be an easy option. The final option is to
	<br><blockquote><p>"dispose or sell-off competitively a service and its assets to another provider",</p></blockquote>
Which sounds like Thatcherism blue in tooth and claw. Of course, Conservative Members are happy with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
All that leaves a real question mark over how the Government expect competition to be applied. The clause embodies the Janus-faced nature of the Bill, which proposes to end the adversarial nature of competitive tendering but confers new powers to impose a far more draconian CCT regime than exists under present legislation. In her reply, will the Minister explain exactly how it will work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to add to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin). The good words that go with best value can easily be seen in the White Paper, but they suddenly started to slip, particularly with respect to this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several Conservative Members said on Second Reading and again at the commencement of the Committee's consideration of the Bill that we needed more details. To date, we still have virtually no details, especially on how the Bill will be implemented. The core part is the reviews, which are needed for performance plans and implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need indicators for the reviews, but we know little about them. The Government will tell local authorities that the Bill will be sewn up, signed and in business, and that local authorities will be implementing it by April 2000. That is a little worrying, because the indicators will be trialled in the year 1999–2000, and the results will not be published until late in 2000. They will not be ready in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 37 trials, and information about the best of them is regularly xeroxed to us in little packs. However, we do not see the worst of them, and I understand from the local government press that some of them are going badly wrong. The pilot schemes will all have reported by late 1999, which will be pretty late for effective action to be taken or for any of the reviews to be moved forward. Reviews are needed also for the codes of guidance. There will be six codes, but none of them are ready. They should follow the trials, and then go out to consultation. We are already running late.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, guidance is needed for the reviews, the reviews are needed for the performance plans; and the whole edifice is starting to look like a house of cards. I am quite sure that, when the days comes, the reviews will be completed and the Government will tell us that everything is wonderful. "Best value" will slip off the tongue as the system slips into gear—but the system will merely falter forwards. After all the ambition, it will fail. In part, that will be because we do not know the details and, therefore, cannot discuss them or strengthen them. We need to work on clause 5 and some of the later clauses, because the reviews are a key part of the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can, however, consider some aspects of the reviews. My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex started, but he was too polite to say that, compared with competitive tendering and with what was stated in the White Paper, clause 5 is a soft touch. It lets everyone off. Subsection (2) is the opposite of what local authorities really want, because it is capable of being used subjectively. It would be possible for the Secretary of State to be quite vindictive. I am sure that the present Secretary of State will not be, but others are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0826">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
yet to come. However, if he wished, the Secretary of State could be obsessively lenient. Indeed, that is a distinct possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only when we come to subsection (4) can we see why I described the clause as a soft touch. Many of the provisions are a straight fudge. For example, subsection (4), paragraphs (e) and (f), talk about competitiveness and making comparisons with commercial and other businesses—in others words, benchmarking. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex pointed out, several local authorities have already set up benchmarking clubs, which is fascinating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one considers which local authorities are members of those clubs—for instance, Tower Hamlets and some of its neighbouring authorities—one suddenly realises that they are patronising little groups, scratching each other's backs, many of them renowned for their incompetence, and many with no inclination to look to business. They sit around in little clubs, drinking cups of tea—it used to be beer and sandwiches—and setting benchmarks that suit themselves. Those benchmarks will not be tested, and those groups will not look to the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking a little further, subsection (4), paragraphs (g), (h) and (i), pivot on the word "assess". In reality, that will mean self-assessment and a guaranteed and mandatory opportunity for many local authorities—including Tower Hamlets—to use that benchmarking, that club, that assessment, that review, possibly, if not probably, to provide themselves with an excuse for their failure to provide a service. Best value may be a soft touch, but it is also a means of favouring the in-house direct labour organisation, and it will be a gift to the unions. I suspect that that is why it was thought up. It certainly will not be a delight for residents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that some local authority services cannot easily be compared with businesses or the voluntary sector, because some services are provided only by local authorities? In such cases, the obvious benchmarking club would be a club of local authorities. However, for services such as the housing service, local authorities are already in benchmarking clubs with housing associations and other authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I almost absolutely agree with the hon. Lady, but for the last part of her argument. We can include the private sector in housing and housing management. I usually use social work as an example. Competitive tendering in some countries is given to the private sector for social work. That is extremely difficult because it is the business of the private sector never to cure anyone's problems. The hon. Lady is right; certain areas would never lend themselves to competitive tendering, hence the short range of services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Curry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Skipton and Ripon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Best value can make a significant contribution to local government efficiency if it is applied vigorously and with common sense in the first instance by local
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
government. We are trying to work out whether such conditions can apply under the Bill. We should not get into too much of an argument about compulsory competitive tendering against best value. Best value would not have existed without CCT.

CCT required local government to do some of the things that it had never done before. It had to define a service, it had to fix a price for it and it had to assess whether that service was being delivered. Those necessary assets did not happen before CCT. It was only when that process had been established that one could move to the more general, self-disciplinary principles of best value. We should be intelligent about how we look at the continuation between one service and another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know the politically correct version of the term "manpower"—[HON. MEMBERS: "Staffing."] I shall explore some of the staffing requirements. CCT had three disadvantages among its advantages. It was intensive in the resources that it required of the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. If one adds the resources that the Audit Commission will now need for recruitment, together with what the DETR requires, will the demand for resources for best value be any less than that for CCT? The great argument against CCT was always that monitoring was a very intensive activity. Will it be less intensive under the Bill? If not, how do we ensure that people do what they are supposed to do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another disadvantage of CCT was that it was difficult to put matters right once contracts that had been awarded went wrong. The process of redress was difficult. I had examples of that in my constituency. It was also difficult to develop, say, a long-term Marks and Spencer relationship with contractors. That requires a lot of monitoring and, given the present circumstances, some contractors might wonder about the long-term Marks and Spencer relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to my main puzzlement. The Minister says that the entire best value programme is liberal and that it depends when the local authority is handed the initiative, after which time it must get on with it. We are told that some authorities are raring to go and want to carry out the process as rapidly as possible. It is not a question of being prescriptive nor is one of the Government ordering this, that or the other. Once the authorities get the bit between their teeth, they are on their way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trials have been taking place and everyone is enthusiastic. But I have difficulty in reconciling a process that has been described as so benign with the terms of clause 5, which is one long, detailed recital of the Secretary of State's powers. It covers every nook and cranny of the activities of the best value review that can be prescribed by the Secretary of State, yet the Minister says that the procedure will be liberal and that there will be none of the "hands-on, we're watching your every move" approach which accompanied CCT. If we examine the range of powers that the Secretary of State will have, the guidance that he may issue and his ability to require things to be done, we see that it is enormous. I am trying to reconcile those two different aspects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is emerging from our scrutiny of the Bill is that clause 4 represents the upper part of the jaw and the setting of standards, while clause 5 represents the lower part of the jaw and the requirement to review. The crunch between the two comes later, when we start measuring outcomes and taking action. I do not fully agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Sir P. Beresford), who, I am reminded, is a dentist. The Bill contains all the powers to continue a CCT regime—and more, if that is how the Government choose to operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried, because the rhetoric and the text diverge. Which is right? Which will ultimately obtain? The Minister has not mentioned a single circumstance in which any one of those powers will be used. However, they have been included for a purpose, not merely to fill up the Bill. Presumably, they are not included merely because a draftsman thought that we should guard against every conceivable eventuality of not being able to force local authorities to do something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with a cricket team with 10 wicket keepers. The Minister will tell me that they do not play cricket in Durham, which is true. They barely play cricket in Durham; it is very much a minor-league county, which made some attempts to enter the major-league. We are dealing with Newcastle United playing nine full backs and one striker—which perhaps accounts for its position in the league at the moment. When will the Minister tell us what the powers are for? In what circumstances might the Secretary of State intervene? What would have to happen for him to use his powers? Will they be used if local authorities fail to do something themselves? The Secretary of State knows which authorities are efficient and which are not. He knows that the problem with local government is not the number of authorities that are able and innovative, but the lumpen mass in the middle that are just not ambitious. We all have experience of that. One Tyneside local authority made a presentation for a Government programme for which it wanted to bid, and the leader fell asleep in the middle of the meeting. I do not think he did so because I was being especially dull, or even that he have been especially well lunched, but it did not demonstrate that anticipated eagerness—	<i>[Interruption]</i>—that hunger for the fray. Moreover, although many authorities are not ambitious, the 10 per cent, at the bottom are just downright awful. In a sense, it is easiest for them; they can make improvements quite sharply. It will be quite hard for those at the top to make further incremental improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister give some examples of circumstances for which the powers are intended? If they do not exist, why are the powers included? Why have we spent a long-time on a clause that is apparently in the Bill purely as some sort of padding? Can she reconcile the rhetoric, which I think is correct?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
I hope that local authorities will take the bit between their teeth and that the process will gain its own momentum and not require the Secretary of State to exercise permanent paternalistic vigilance over it, but will really motor. However, the powers are obviously included to cover circumstances in which that does not happen. In what sort of circumstances will the Secretary of State use those powers? Through which mechanisms will he use his powers? How will we know that they are being used? What sort of processes will he undergo to be able to exercise them, so that we can be convinced that he is doing the right thing by taxpayers in that local authority's area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian White 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, North-East</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>): It is strange that Conservative Members argue against this clause because it is too Tory. [Hon. Members: "No, we did not."] The hon. Member for North Essex did. They protest too much. I have been a member of a Conservative-controlled authority, a hung authority and a Labour-controlled authority. I never thought that I would agree with the hon. Member for Mole Valley, but I wish that I had been able to quote him when Buckinghamshire, a Conservative-controlled authority, started to put out its services to the Freemantle trust, because his arguments are almost identical to the arguments that I used at that time.

As we all know, CCT was about compulsion, not competitiveness. There were good elements to it—the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon identified some of them. However, I remember cases such as that of a CCT refuse contract that was put out to tender for the first time. An in-house bid was put in to compare against the private bid and, to the consternation of the then ruling group, the in-house bid won. Their friends in Government, through the Milton Keynes development corporation, then withdrew part of the contract so that the private sector was the lowest bid and could be awarded the contract. Such fiddles, artificialities and bending of the rules went on in CCT—the Opposition would doubtless argue that there were also many successes—and they occurred because of the way in which the then Government implemented CCT, where the operative word was "compulsion". The Opposition do not understand that the measure would take the best bits of CCT and apply them in a way that allowed local authorities to develop what is right for their own areas. It is about getting the national and local balances right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with interest. Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that, if a local authority failed to meet the targets, standards or indicators, or whatever word is used, in a service—that may or may not be in Tower Hamlets—the wording of the clause would allow a local authority that wished to do so, as many would, to use words, assessments, self-assessments and so on to cover its back so that it could create the same sort of nonsense as occurred under CCT, on both sides of the fence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. White</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The important point is that the Bill is about local authorities working together to achieve best value for their area. The hon. Gentleman laughs—but one of the problems with the compulsory element
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0828">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
of CCT was that it created an adversarial system that did not deliver. It did not allow for the kind of long-term relationships that companies need with local authorities. I am in favour of competition and of the private sector doing some work in the local authorities, but I am not in favour of that being artificially forced on local authorities, as happened under CCT.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I are more in agreement than he might accept. Those powers are much more flexible—but the flexibility to decide when and how competitive tendering will apply to a local authority rests entirely with the Secretary of State. The hon. Gentleman is, therefore, placing far more trust in the benign intentions of the Secretary of State than was ever necessary under CCT. However, I am interested to hear what he is saying about CCT and I am sure that both sides of the Committee can learn from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. White</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that the Opposition do not seem to have learnt what is going on in the pilot authorities. The documents that have been made available to members of the Committee make it clear that local authorities want the scheme to work and are prepared to make it do so. In the long-term, the measure will be to the advantage of the residents and council tax payers of those local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was encouraged by my hon. Friend the Minister's response to earlier points. Perhaps she could reassure me on two minor points? Will she ensure that like is compared with like? In the past, some local authorities complained that a comparison was not valid because it was like comparing chalk and cheese. For example, a comparison between my local authority, which has a growing population of between 5,000 and 7,000 a year, and an authority whose population was decreasing would reveal such a problem. Perhaps my hon. Friend will accept that like should be compared with like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One danger is that in some areas the competent are put with the competent and the incompetent with the incompetent, so the standards of the latter remain low.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. White</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill's purpose is to increase standards. Comparing like with like does that. Artificial comparisons, which mean nothing, detract from the validity of the comparison. People may say that it does not matter if we do not compare like with like rather than think about how to achieve service of a high standard. Comparing like with like is extremely important in that a local authority that has most to improve can demonstrate that the authority with which it is compared is in the same position. Therefore it has something to learn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns different types of authority. My authority does not have a social services department: it has combined its children's social services with education, so the psychologists and perhaps its social workers are often in the same team. That was done because an analysis of unitary authorities when they were created showed that there was a better way of spending money. It was recognised
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
that there was not as much money available as they would want, nor as big economies of scale to be made as there were in county authorities. Therefore, to achieve the same level of service in a best value sense they saved money and gave better service through that combination. But nothing fits neatly into boxes. I hope that the Government will recognise those local authorities that have been innovative and done things differently, and, with best value, improved service and saved money. I hope, too, that they will accept that local authorities do differ. This will prevent them doing a best value test on social services and education when the two services are the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adrian Sanders 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torbay)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 5 goes to the heart of the Bill as regards best value. I should like to knock on the head those who look to the pilots to justify clause 5. If the pilots have been successful, it has been without the prescriptive guidance given by the clause, which suggests that they are a little over the top.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides the Secretary of State with a power to issue guidance to best value authorities on the form, content and timing of reviews, and may include specific guidance on the way in which the performance indicators and targets should be used in attaining best value. It provides the Secretary of State with the power to issue guidance in respect of the main elements of the review process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State issues guidance, determines the components, and even determines the methodology, yet the Government rejected amendment No. 87, which would have ensured that the Secretary of State had regard to local consultation undertaken by authorities when guidance on reviews was issued. There is a danger here of introducing a system of uniformity that will stifle innovation and examples of excellence, such as those defined by the recipients of local services who, I suggest, are best placed to determine whether they have received best value. The danger is that best value could replace best practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another danger, which is that the Secretary of State may change. The Government's aims could be wrecked because power resides at the centre, not in local communities, where services are delivered. That is a non-partisan point. A Liberal Democrat Secretary of State could doing the wrecking just as easily as a Conservative or Labour holder of that office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Business has been mentioned. Today's successful businesses devolve decision making to people who can take decisions locally, because they recognise that markets are different and that customers are diverse. Therefore, this prescriptive clause is against the normal, and perhaps best, practices of modern business. It is wrong for the Government to claim that this is a business-friendly Bill. For those reasons, we shall vote with Conserviative Members against clause 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Hayes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Holland and The Deepings)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have succeeded in clause 5, as well as in other clauses, in mixing an unlikely and unpalatable cocktail, containing an apparent paradox. First, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0829">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
Bill will mean the nationalisation of local government. The Secretary of State will be given greater powers of control. He will be able to
	<br><blockquote><p>"specify a period within which an authority is to review all its functions".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (5) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may issue guidance on—
	<ol>	<li>the timetable for a review;</li>
	<li>the procedure for a review;</li>
	<li>the form in which a review should be recorded".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
That represents a massive transfer of power from local government to the Secretary of State, regardless of who holds that office. When the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) said that the Secretary of State might change, my heart warmed and I viewed the Bill in a slightly better light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mindful of the fact that the Bill will give the Secretary of State additional powers, I took the trouble to read the debate on Second Reading of the Local Government Act 1988, when such matters were discussed in the context of compulsory competitive tendering. The Labour spokesman, the right hon. Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham), now the Minister for the Cabinet Office, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The road to greater and necessary efficiency in local government is by strengthening democratically elected local authorities, not by undermining them, by giving local communities more rights and more information and not denying it to them".—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 6 July 1987; Vol. 119, c.94.]</p></blockquote>
He also said that, if the level of control that the then Opposition claimed the Government were to take were implemented in any other country or commercial organisation, it would be greeted with horror. Yet the powers that the Secretary of State is taking unto himself are considerably greater, and certainly more pervasive across the activities of local government, in this Bill than in 1988 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paradox, the apparently contradictory cocktail to which I referred is that, while nationalising local government using the uniform standards, targets, national indicators, and the national system of review and consultation—all of which I entirely reject and refute because I believe in local democracy—the Bill will also mean a commercialisation of local government. It contains powers to oblige a local authority
	<br><blockquote><p>"to assess the competitiveness of its performance in exercising the function by reference to … best value authorities and commercial and other businesses … to consult other best value authorities and commercial and other businesses about the exercise of the function".</p></blockquote>
That is, without doubt, a commercialisation of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex said, that represents not only a continuation of compulsory competitive tendering, but an extension of the involvement of business in local services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must return in the end to the ambiguity of the Bill. We can find out about the exercise of the powers only from the White Paper. The fact is that there is the potential for a more draconian system, but we do not know whether Ministers intend
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
to use it, because, as with the previous clause, they will not tell us how they will exercise their powers, nor what standards they will set.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The Bill does not tell us explicitly how the Secretary of State will use his powers. The absence of guidance and the generalisations that we have heard during the debates, give rise to fears such as those expressed by my hon. Friend. Paradoxically, the Bill might mean a nationalisation of local government targets and a commercialisation of its services. In other words, it might mean that targets set nationally are delivered locally by private organisations with no place in between for local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may not be surprised that I do not share his concerns about commercialisation. From my experience in local government, I know that if the private sector thinks it will not get a task, its disinterest will be dramatic and will pervade its response. However, if it believes that there is a chance that it will get the contract, it will explain how it can do the task better and put a suggested value on it that is higher than that given in its commercial bid. It will have seen the local authority's papers, and so the suggested value will be lower than the local authority's recommendation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend speaks with the experience of having run a local authority. However, I was a member of a local authority for many years, and my experience suggests that it would be entirely inappropriate to assess the quality of some local authority services by reference to similar services provided by commercial organisations. Public protection springs to mind, as does a range of care services. In such cases, I would be most unhappy for the Secretary of State to impose a comparison on a local authority in the draconian manner that has been suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many services benefit from private sector involvement, as Wandsworth and Westminster—the jewels in the crown of local government—demonstrate. However, it would be wrong for the Secretary of State to use the unreasonable powers that appear in the Bill to assess some services through comparison with the private sector. Will the Minister rule out such comparisons?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would clarify a point. There is a well developed private sector in social services and residential care that offers an extremely good product at a very good price. The hon. Gentleman seems to be dissociating himself from that. Does he agree that the private sector does have a rule to play?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be inappropriate to privatise some services, for example, in social work—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> We can only assume that the Government will do that, given the powers granted to the Secretary of State. Will the Minister confirm that there is no hidden agenda? I am sure that the hon. Member for Torbay agrees that it is inappropriate to privatise a range of public protection services. As the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0830">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
hon. Gentleman says, there are certain areas where we can learn from private enterprise. Will the Minister reassure us about the Government's intentions, as there is a public groundswell of fear about what they might do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend saying that nothing is beyond the reach of the best value process? Competitive tendering was confined to a limited number of areas specifically targeted to the private sector. However, anything that a local authority does might be put out to the private sector or privatised completely. Indeed, the White Paper seems to confirm that, and perhaps goes as far as the late, great Lord Ridley, who believed that local authorities should meet once a year to have lunch to allocate contracts and then disappear. I do not share that view, but perhaps the Bill makes provision for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill gives power to the Secretary of State to define its provisions in any way that a particular Secretary of State might choose. I have asked for assurances from the Minister that when the Bill is enacted, a Secretary of State with a rather more libertarian bent than that of either my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex or I, will not choose to bring into the scope of private sector management and delivery, a range of services that few people in this Committee or, indeed, in Parliament would wish to be passed into private hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just had an idea. Perhaps the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) could have a job. If a local authority chose to contract out the writing of its best value review to a consultant like him, the local authority might get better value for money than doing its best value review in-house. Does my hon. Friend think that that is a possibility?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not from anything I have heard or seen today. I remain to be convinced, but may be during the Committee's progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the measure is about the nationalisation and, perhaps, the commercialisation of local government. The critical point is that it is wrong to transfer so many powers into the hands of a Secretary of State who may take perverse decisions against the interests of local people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to discuss clause 5 as we have not had all the necessary details. We have probed and pushed and have managed to extract three examples of reviews—class sizes, social services and food standards. It is hard to have a sensible debate when so little has been given away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Wales and the Minister for Local Government and Housing gave us totally contradictory statements. There are enormous powers in the Bill that I suspect would horrify Labour Members if a Conservative Government came to power, and they realised what had been given away. The line taken by the Under-Secretary of State for Wales is that local government "will have to" or "must
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
meet" the requirements. Such imperious phrases offer no flexibility or local accountability. The Minister tried to mollify those comments a little later by saying that there will not be a comprehensive set of targets and that there needed to be a framework, not a straitjacket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, the Government Benches are muddled about whether it is a centralising Bill, giving huge powers to the Secretary of State. I believe that it is and that such decisions should be taken locally. Both Ministers completely failed to give an intelligent response to the specific examples that Conservative Members cited. I referred to the national target on class sizes and quoted a constituency case showing that one school will be thrown into chaos by the requirement to find an extra class and teacher for three children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I keep trying to drag the debate back to specific, real examples. I should like the Minister to give us a list of the standards. Will she also comment on my remarks that we cannot lay down national targets. Targets should be decided locally; the response should be made locally; and decisions should be made locally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I invite my hon. Friend to ask the Minister to rule out the privatisation of the power of local authorities to statement children with special needs. Statementing is an important part of the local education authority's responsibilities, which has been protected from Government interference through successive pieces of legislation in the 1980s and 1990s and, indeed, was reaffirmed by recent legislation—the Education Act 1996. I wonder whether, under this Bill's requirements, competitiveness in this field will be assessed by reference to commercial and other businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I leave it to the Minister to decide that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the form shown in our previous debates, I am afraid that my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) will be disappointed yet again. At every stage, all Ministers have run away from specific details from the real world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to repeat the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley, but he mentioned the timetable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A performance standard that might be worth setting is a maximum period for the statementing process. The idea of putting that process out to tender is startling, but nothing in the Bill suggests that any local authority functions will be protected from that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent such a process from being put out to tender. The Under-Secretary glibly stated that there would not be many new standards. What are the new standards?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to consider the timetable. My hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley explained that the process would take time and that the programme would hit the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0831">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
buffers at some point. It will do that more quickly in Wales, where all the powers that the Bill grants to the Secretary of State will be vested in the National Assembly for Wales. Setting up the Assembly after the elections, divesting the Welsh Office of its powers, and handing them over to an untried deliberative and executive body will be hard enough without going through the details of clause 5—especially subsections (4), (6) and (7)—which will be a monumental task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend for Mole Valley that clause 5 could be a cop out. As I have said in previous debates, one party is likely to dominate the Assembly and many local authorities in Wales. Clause 5 provides wide-ranging powers, which are endorsed in clause 113 of the Government of Wales Act 1998. It gives the Assembly an absolute right to establish the targets, guidance and standards that will suit its cosy political friends on the councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes the point about consistency. The Bill gives the same powers to the Secretary of State and to the National Assembly for Wales. The powers may be exercised in completely different ways. The Assembly may choose not to exercise any of the Bill's powers out of spite. There might be a dispute with London about funding because the Assembly believed that Wales was underfunded when compared with Scotland.

How would the Assembly treat local authorities in a dispute about spending? The democratically elected Assembly will be able to exercise the powers that we are considering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend touches the raw nerve of the devolution experiment. The point has been made to the Government often, but it has never been satisfactorily tackled. I am delighted that the Government Whip is listening, and not reading his MFI catalogue, as he did in our previous sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contrary to the Government Whip's comments about PR, I believe that targets should be set and reviewed on the hustings. The electorate should be able to vote for candidate so-and-so, on the grounds that he presented and delivered the best programme.

If the National Assembly for Wales administers clause 5, there will be an unholy muddle. Instead of referring to the electorate, the councillors will look to the Assembly for favours.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Jon Owen Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to help the hon. Gentleman because any raw nerves about devolution are suffered by Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Shropshire claims that a cosy relationship will exist between the Labour party, which would rule in a Welsh Assembly, if it were elected by the people of Wales, and councils, which would be Labour controlled, if a majority of Labour councillors were elected. Yet the hon. Gentleman does
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
not accuse a Secretary of State in the House of Commons of possibly being guilty of any sort of cosy relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why he does not have confidence in the ability of the people of Wales to elect people who would pursue best value and avoid cosy relationships, when he does feel confident that, whatever party is in power at Westminster, those cosy relationships do not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has completely misunderstood what I have been saying. My point is that the Assembly will receive national guidelines laid down by central Government, from the Cabinet. It will receive its funds from central Government. It will then disburse them as it wishes. It will not be responsible. The people of Wales will vote for councillors and Assembly men—often from among the same sort of people. Many Assembly men will be ex-councillors. It is not fantasy to assume that those people will work closely together and arrive at cosy relationships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Secretary of State would normally be responsible in Cabinet. He would be subject to national exposure requiring him to justify his actions. The Assembly—and this has always been our argument—will make the relevant decisions parochial. Matters will come to be decided by a cosy club. That is inevitable. The effect of that is to take real power from the people. The place to review services is on the hustings. Matters will be bad enough in England, but they will exacerbated in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right that Wales is a special case, but his point about local councillors paying lip service and dancing to the tune of Government rather than listening to local people could be applied to the whole kingdom, in the sense that the performance criteria—the targets set by Government, effectively along national lines—would become the driving force for the local authority, in place of the will, wishes, needs and aspirations of local people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I entirely agree. That will certainly happen in England. Councils' loyalties will be torn between satisfying all the lengthy criteria imposed by the Secretary of State under the Bill and the demands of their electors. They will look less to the latter. However, that will be doubly so in Wales. It is extraordinary that this is the first time that the issue has been raised. The measure will undermine local democracy. The Minister has, in sedentary asides, made noises to the effect that she is pro local democracy and that the Bill will strengthen it. She is wrong. I envisage the Bill undermining local democracy and taking power from the people who should make the decisions. It is the people who should carry out the review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minsiter said in the Committee's first sitting, openness and accountability are needed, and the duty that arises under best value is to the public; it is for them to decide. The measure that we are considering is a move away from that approach. It will take away powers and bring about centralisation—doubly so in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a fascinating clause stand part debate, which has persuaded me that the Government have got things right. We heard from Opposition Members that the measure was both draconian and that it was a soft touch. We heard that it was nationalising and abandoning real responsibility. The Opposition are trying desperately to find something wrong, but have not been able to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to describe precisely the purpose of clause 5. I am delighted that the hon. Member for North Essex has now found the White Paper and recognises how good it is. In it we made it clear that local authorities would be required early on to assess their priorities and draw up a programme of fundamental performance reviews. We also set out how we proposed to use the powers now in the Bill. We said then that the best value authorities would be required to review fundamentally the performance of all their services over a period that would probably be set at five years, making early inroads into areas of significant weakness. The purpose of the reviews is to ensure continuous improvements to all services, not just to those with serious shortcomings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal outcome of each review will be performance targets that reflect what people want and are prepared to pay for. In practice, the reviews will challenge why and how a service is being provided, which opens up the possibility of meeting community needs in new ways. I provided an example this morning of one of the pilot authorities that did so for adoption services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reviews will also invite comparison with the performance of others using national performance indicators and other locally developed means to take into account the views of service users and potential suppliers. Most Conservative Members will welcome the confirmation that comparison is going to be an element, though some of them said in earlier sittings that they did not believe that that was valid. I hope that by now all Conservative Members will have been persuaded of the importance of comparison and I invite them to consider one of the pilot organisations—a collection of five local district authorities whose first letters form the acronym CWOIL—which worked on benchmarking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard conflicting views on benchmarking from Opposition Members. The pilot authority seriously studied how much authorities have to pay for specific aspects of housing management and what they get for what they pay. The services had been CCT's—if the 	<i>Hansard</i> writers will forgive such an awful expression—or made subject to compulsory competitive tendering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pilot authorities now realise that they did not know the half of it and did not have enough information to work out precisely what they received for what they paid. They have now been through an interesting and challenging exercise to get to the root of what is really happening and to make proper comparisons. The private sector should also be able to make proper assessments of whether they can meet the council's requirements. That shows the value of
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
comparison. Authorities are learning much about their own practices and are already making substantial improvements across the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that that was done by the pilot authorities without clause 5?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot have it all ways. The pilots were developed within the framework established first by the Green Paper and then by the White Paper on which the Bill is based. There is tension within local government over how much should be set down and how much authorities should be left to do themselves. One of the earliest criticisms was that the Government had not said enough, but I resisted going down that road of being too prescriptive. I wanted to maintain a balance and a framework rather than a set of prescriptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make progress as so many points were made in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next issue about which the reviews are concerned is consultation with local tax payers, service users and the wider business companies and the setting of new performance targets. Again, this is within the spirit of best value and I was surprised to hear the remarks of the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings which made me wonder whether we were living in another fantasy Parliament game. He certainly would not have been welcomed by his Front Bench in the last Parliament. Many of the activities of his Government were far more prescriptive than our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that authorities should not consult the local business community is beyond me. Local businesses have an essential part to play in the authority's area whether or not they might be interested in activities that the council perform from a commercial perspective. They have a real interest in making sure that that place works and that their business is able to thrive there. The idea that simply consulting leads to commercialisation and that consulting commercial enterprises about the best value review somehow commercialises the authority is quite simply beyond me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to correct the Minister; I have no problem with the local authority consulting local businesses. That has been a normal part of local government practice for a long time. This is about a local authority assessing its services by reference to similar practice in commercial areas. Is she saying that there are no holds barred and that there are no local authority activities that should not be assessed commercially?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That hon. Member needs to deal with the clause. The clause is about review. In those reviews we expect the local authority to consult with local tax payers, service users and the wider business community. We also want to embrace fair competition. We would want the review to embrace
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0833">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>187</span>
fair competition as a means of securing efficient and effective services. That is competition not as an end in itself but as a means of bringing about the continuous improvements that the consumers expect and which is designed to secure improvements in quality as well as in costs. It is fair to all sides while undertaken in a climate where employees' basic rights are respected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has mentioned consulting on reviews with council tax payers which I found interesting as I did not see it in the clause. She also says that they will consult the users and that does not appear to be in the clause. Perhaps she has an amendment in mind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was explaining, if hon. Members rememeber—I have taken so many interventions that I suspect they have forgotten—how this was set out in the White Paper upon which the Bill is built. The Bill pursues the issues in the White Paper but does so in a way that gives the flexibility that we also say is part of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If hon. Members bear with me, they will be able to come back to those issues once they have heard more of the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No I want to get through the argument and then I will be happy to take interventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a point about competition. The hon. Lady was talking about competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady, although, like my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley, I cannot find a reference to consultation in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will come to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady said that she was in favour of competition, but not as an end in itself. She must understand that there is the caricature of competitive tendering, something in which Conservative Members never believed. I accept that the hon. Lady must keep on putting up straw dollies to knock them down. That is part of politics, but let us have a real debate on competition and not one based on outdated, left-wing fantasies that should not be part of the third way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On competition, the White Paper refers at paragraph 7.28 to the Government taking
	<br><blockquote><p>"firm and swift action against any authority that provides service to itself, or to others, at a trading loss."</p></blockquote>
How often does the hon. Lady expect the Government to take such action and what are the means in the Bill by which it will be taken?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to take us further into the Bill and to encourage me to gaze into a crystal ball. I shall do neither while we are discussing clause 5 stand part. The powers of intervention are dealt with in later clauses and I am sure that we shall enjoy a lively debate when we reach them. I was never a crystal ball gazer and I do not intend to become one today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard some contradictory views from Opposition Members about how competition should be used, when it should be used and the extent of it. I found those exchanges interesting. We are eventually beginning to tease out from Conservative Members their recognition that compulsory competitive tendering had drawbacks and that it did not work in some areas. The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings seems to think that there are more powers in the Bill than were under the compulsory competitive tendering process. I hate to tell him, but he cannot count.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is repealing more than 50 powers 	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—I am trying to deal with the points that were raised in debate. Opposition Members may or may not be interested in accuracy. The compulsory competitive tendering regime had reached its sell-by date. As the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon said, the previous Administration found it difficult because it required so much central monitoring at a level that it was hardly possible to carry out. If it was to be effective, why did it take nine years before it was extended to include most blue collar services? Why did it take another five years before it was extended to white collar services? Even then, many areas were still not subject to competition at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Competition will continue to be a key management tool in delivering best value and in driving up standards. Unlike CCT, it will be a means to an end rather than an end in itself. Best value will go further than CCT by requiring authorities to review all services and functions in respect of their competitiveness. Our approach will be based on the principle of partnership, not confrontation, and we shall respect employees' basic rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall also embrace a range of attitudes to competition with authorities able to use different approaches, which suit their circumstances and those of their partners. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East asked me about comparisons in the development of best value. We want to ensure that proper and fair comparisons are made and, therefore, as far as possible, that comparisons are made in a like-by-like manner. That is why performance indicators are so important. We have heard much railing about performance indicators, and I began to wonder whether some hon. Members did not know about existing legislation. Performance indicators already exist that are not developed by local government but upon which local government is consulted. That will continue. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0834">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
performance indicators will not be plucked out of the sky; they will be developed to meet the priorities of local people and will be a target for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whitehall knows best.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for North Essex said that Whitehall knows best. He must already have forgotten last week's debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fearful of straying on to a previous clause, Mr. O'Brien, but I made it absolutely clear last week that some performance indicators will be national but that others, and more of them, will be locally determined and will form part of the local performance plan. The Opposition seem to think that we cannot talk about performance indicators because they are not laid out in the Bill; but they forget that they are a good management tool now. Indeed, they are already used by the Audit Commission to fulfil its statutory obligation to collect information to allow proper comparisons to be made between authorities. I wonder whether Opposition Members have conveniently forgotten the existing position, or whether they are trying to pretend that they had forgotten.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the specific subject of performance indicators, some already exist and are used as a comparator of one authority's performance against another; they also have to be published. Would the Minister remind the Committee what happens to an authority if it fails to meet the standards of any of those performance indicators that exist now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reality is that nothing happens. Local people are frustrated; they sometimes have to wait another three or four years before they can make any comment. The information is sometimes presented to them in such an obscure way that they cannot understand what has been going on. That is unacceptable, which is why we want a much more coherent system. We want local people to be far more involved in setting their local performance indicators than they are now, and to be able to ask questions about the comparison, which they cannot do now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East asked whether the reviews would allow one to look across services—what are presently seen as a service block. That is certainly possible. Indeed, it is happening in the pilot schemes. Some are looking at services for young people, and others are looking at services for the elderly. The reviews are being carried out in a sensible way and best value is progressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several points were raised by the Opposition, some of which, as I have already said, were contradictory. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon implied that I was saying that the whole regime was benign. I am far from saying that. I am not naive about the fact that, for some authorities, it will be a very taxing and difficult regime. That, however, is because they have not been used to properly assessing what they have been doing and have not been putting their actions up to scrutiny and the public gaze—let alone that of other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
The right hon. Gentleman asked me about monitoring. We shall come to this on future clauses when we examine audit and inspection, and debate intervention powers. We want effective monitoring that will lead to genuine opportunities for local authorities themselves to take hold of what is happening and to try to improve performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Local Government Association on establishing an improvement and development agency, which will have the support of local government in assisting local authorities to understand what is happening within them and to find ways of moving forward. I hope that the work being done by the LGA will act as a spur to those authorities that the right hon. Gentleman described as not very imaginative or innovative to try to improve their practice, and move forward. The right hon. Gentleman's speech made the argument for flexibility rather than a rigid system which Parliament prescribed but which does not match the changing and developing practice in local government. If the reviews are effective and result in authorities examining their practice rigorously and opening themselves up to other people's rigour and challenge, be it in the private or voluntary sectors, or simply among members of the public, local authorities will be able to demonstrate a genuine determination to improve their performance. That is of interest to us all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the record, I can help the hon.

Perhaps that is evidence that she cannot count and that I can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the Secretary of State will be given 24 powers in the Bill. I may have got it wrong; it may be 23 or 25. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It has been reduced by three by one of our amendments. May I remind hon. Members that powers under compulsory competitive tendering legislation gave the Secretary of State complete discretion to decide what was and what was not competitive. The Secretary of State did not need to come back to the House to say, "We want to extend CCT to another area." He had complete discretion. I hope, therefore, that we shall hear no more from Tory Members about Secretaries of State having discretion or about whether this or that is to be privatised. We are determined that reviews will be rigorous so as to ensure that local authorities find the most effective way of delivering a service, and do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not object to that; I am in favour of it. Nor do I object to the Secretary of State's powers. I realise that they are inevitable. I merely asked the Minister for one example of a circumstance in which they might be used, but up to now I have not had one.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0835">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

Before the hon. Lady concludes, will she explain the purpose of clause 5, and, in particular, the purpose of any provision in it after the first subsection? What will the Secretary of State do at nine o'clock on a Monday morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon about the general basis of agreement for those authorities that wish to get on with the job. However, some authorities will not do so through incompetence or intransigence. The Minister keeps using the words "if, if, if about the service. But what about "if not"? Will she give an example of that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given Opposition Members examples before, but they abuse their privilege. We have made it clear that powers of intervention will be used if authorities do not fulfil their responsibilities under best value and deliver what local people expect and at the price that those people are prepared to pay. The provision for intervention powers appears later in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The review is a tool to ensure that local authorities examine what they do. They will not be judged on the review, but on action taken as a result of the review. The Secretary of State's guidance will direct how local authorities go about the review and how best value authorities set targets and formulate action plans arising from them. They will be judged on the effectiveness of their action plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I to understand that all best value reviews will begin without the Secretary of State using powers under clause 5? Would he use such powers only if he was dissatisfied with the way a review had been conducted? The Secretary of State appears to be setting the rules of the game in advance. Clause 5 (1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A best value authority must conduct best value reviews of its functions in accordance with the provisions of any order made under this section."</p></blockquote>
The Minister seems to be implying that local authorities will set up their own mechanisms and conduct reviews, and that the Secretary of State has fallback powers to monitor whether such actions are happening in the way that he wants. Which comes first, the chicken or the egg? Will the Secretary of State's powers precede the review?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Guidance will be issued to help authorities embark on the review process. Further action will be taken, if needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5 is a central plank in the best value framework. It requires best value authorities to review their functions at a fundamental level, and will, therefore, be crucial in creating a climate in which continuous improvements in the performance of functions can be achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will save time if we can clarify matters now. Will the Secretary of State's guidance be specific to certain authorities, as stated in the Bill, or will it apply to a family of authorities? In SSAs, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
Secretary of State can operate only on a family basis, or through what we now call benchmarking clubs. Will the guidance be specific to a particular authority or to a review? Will there be a broad framework initially?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be general guidance on reviews. I have made that clear five times now. For example, in some instances, different guidance will be given to police authorities and social service authorities. We have already examined the different categories to which the Bill applies. Intervention powers will not apply to the review. We want to ensure that, following review, authorities set up action plans and act upon them. They will be judged on how well they do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's last comments leave me more confused than ever. The details of the guidance for the review process start at clause 5 (5), guidance for which is in turn set out in the White Paper, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government will issue guidance which will explain the factors that should be considered in making such a choice"—</p></blockquote>
that is, between different methods of service delivery, and
	<br><blockquote><p>"The guidance will also include provision for transparency and robust cost apportionment."</p></blockquote>
That sort of guidance comes first, but, presumably, directions from the Secretary of State and orders specifying how the review should be undertaken and making it mandatory will follow if the guidance is not adhered to. That underlines one of the aspects of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether we count powers numerically or try to evaluate how wide those 27, 25 or 50 powers go, the fact is that those powers are much wider than in any previous legislation. I shall not take any lectures from the Minister about the wideness of competitive tendering. I notice that the Minister becomes far more confident when she has a note from her civil servants in her hand from which to speak than when she addresses the issues herself. Would that such confidence were given to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the application of CCT, the Secretary of State always made it clear which local authority functions were included. The Minister will not give any indication, now or, probably, in future, of which functions are covered by the best value process. That is a significant difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My recollection is that the Secretary of State as has already been stated, simply told people which services were to be progressively put out to CCT. That appears to be rather at odds with what the hon. Gentleman said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave the impression that the Secretary of State could, on a day-to-day basis, tell people which functions to put out to tender, but it was always clear which generic services were subject to competitive tendering. Hence the Minister can ask
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0836">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
why white-collar work, for example, was put out to competitive tender only at a certain date, because white-collar work was not subject to competitive tendering before that date. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am not sure how fruitful this exchange is. Looking at the Government Whip's face, I am not sure how much he appreciates the extension of our proceedings on that matter.

The Minister will not give examples of when she expects the powers under the the clause to be exercised. She is right that she had her fingers burnt when she tried to be helpful to the Committee before, because we were rather surprised by the examples that she gave. That has made her shy about being open with the Committee, which is rather sad, because we have a more constructive debate when we are better informed. Perhaps we should not further extend the Minister's discomfort on this clause and should, as the Liberal Democrats suggest, press the matter to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 6 deals with best value annual performance plans which are the main instrument by which best value authorities are to be held accountable for delivering best value to their local communities. Performance plans are, therefore, a vital instrument in the legislation. Members of the Committee might know that Liberal Democrats have long argued for something that we have called an annual citizens' tax contract, to be sent by national Government to all taxpayers so that they know what they pay, what they are getting for what they pay and what the Government's plans are. I see the Government Whip nodding—I hope that that means that the Government will shortly announce that as one of their policies, because they sometimes steal our best policies. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, that is a challenge. While on the subject, it may be appropriate to consider whether the Government should themselves be subject to best value. If so, various Departments may propose some interesting performance plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 143 is a probing amendment, designed to evoke some clarification from the Minister. Subsection (1) is vague and does not, for example, state whether performance plans should be issued for all services provided or even whether they should state why an authority does not provide certain services—for example, discretionary grants, which several authorities stopped providing altogether for financial reasons. The public are not always aware of what an authority can provide—especially a couple of years after they have stopped providing it. The clause also does not say whether performance plans should apply separately to individual services or whether, as we have debated previously, can relate to groups of services, for example all services for the elderly or for children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a small point, my own local education authority managed to provide discretionary awards for students until the new Government were elected in May 1997, since then it has been unable to do so. The issue is the funding of local authorities, not best value. I am waiting to hear from the Minister how best value might apply to that process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware—I will not take too much of the Committee's time in reminding him—that if authorities stopped providing discretionary grants in May 1997, they were working on a budget set during the Tory years. Budgets are set in the preceding year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall discuss amendment No. 34, which I hope will give the Minister time to comment specifically on the role of the business community. Clause 3 (2) lists among those who are to be statutory consultees people within the authorities area who pay national non-domestic rates. If the Secretary of State must take the power—the Committee will know by now that we disagree with many of those powers—to state, by order, matters that authorities should include in their performance plans, that order should require them to summarise the outcome of the consultation exercise, as well as the other 12 matters that are listed in the Bill.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0837">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
It is strange that the Government do not believe that a summary of the consultation should be included in a performance plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have long had a duty to consult local businesses. In the past, they did so when they set the business rate. The Conservatives introduced the national non-domestic rate and thus broke the specific link between local government and the business community. The Government included in the White Paper, which the Minister earlier described as excellent, a welcome proposal to return to local authorities at least an element of control over business rates. The Liberal Democrats would like even more control to be returned to local authorities, but at least the White Paper proposes more control than local authorities have currently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the amendment will give the Minister the opportunity to state the Government's plans for implementing their manifesto commitment, which was also made in the White Paper. We have already been told that it influenced the Bill. If the Government consider business ratepayers to be important consultees, who are mentioned in the Bill, will the Minister tell the Committee how soon the Government will restore the close link between local authorities and the business community?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government intend to amend the Police Act 1996 to provide for the annual policing plan to fulfill the requirements of best value performance plans? That would be preferable to imposing on police authorities the onerous and expensive duty of publishing two separate plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, we are discussing a new power for the Secretary of State. Again, it is a power that is to be applied by order. It might have been a matter for guidance, or a simple obligation might have been placed on local authorities, thus doing away with the Secretary of State's role. The effect would be the same, especially if the order-making power is ultimately available. The Bill specifies a framework that is a potential straitjacket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The substance of amendment No. 143, moved by the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard), is implicit in the Bill. I shall be interested in the Minister's comments on that. I understood that a performance plan would have to cover
	<br><blockquote><p>"all functions exercised wholly or partly by the authority".</p></blockquote>
The amendments that we tabled apply to subsection (2) (g). They do not deal with a great issue but one that bears some scrutiny. Under the Bill, the plan for a financial year must,
	<br><blockquote><p>"compare that performance with the authority's performance in previous financial years or with the performance of other best value authorities".</p></blockquote>
We believe that we have an opportunity to strengthen the nature of the comparisons by insisting that they should be made with previous financial years and with other best value authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also believe that there is little purpose in making such comparisons if authorities can simply compare themselves with any best value authority. My hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley made a similar point earlier when he mentioned benchmarking cuts.
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
Comparisons should be made with the best value authority that performs best. I look forward to the Minister's comments on that suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats' usual cri de coeur is that the plan should reflect the outcome of the consultation required under clause 3(2). We have some sympathy with that because the electors—the people we want to serve and who depend on the services—should be at the front of our minds all the time. I should be grateful if the Minister would deal with all those points when replying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak in support of the amendment because it has great relevance to my local authority. The Meriden constituency falls into the Metropolitan borough of Solihull which, on the Government's own national performance indicators, is deemed to be a high-performing authority. Although it bid to be part of the pilot scheme on best value authorities, it did not succeed, but it was regarded by the Government as being one of the interesting bids, along with the 15 other authorities that are grouped together and which are working with Warwick university going through the Bill and considering the concept of best value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The officers of that authority have brought to my attention the problem of the high-performing authorities and the question of the best-performing authority. If one's authority is already a high performer, for continuous improvement to be achieved, it is important that a competitor is found to keep the overall performance of that authority up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the authority is part of a local peer group of authorities. Without singling out any of those authorities, or making derogatory remarks about their performance, that group does not obviously contain other very high performers. Therefore, the immediate comparison of benchmarking is not one that would necessarily drive up the performance of Solihull further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making an interesting point. The Minister said that performance indicators have been around for a long time and that they provide a lot of meat and drink for the debate about efficiency in local government. One of the most outstanding authorities on most performance indicators is Wandsworth council. There tends to be resistance among local authorities. If I ask my local authorities—Essex county council, Tendring district council or Colchester borough council—why they cannot do things like Wandsworth, they say, that they are not like Wandsworth, but are in a different area and under different conditions. Is it possible to make comparisons between different authorities? Perhaps that is the question that my hon. Friend wants the Minister to illuminate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that very illuminating example of the problem. My authority would have little opportunity to compare with Wandsworth. It is part of a west midland LGA pure assessment scheme and I should probably encounter the same reaction if I cited that authority for comparison. Perhaps I could put on record that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0838">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
great hope of my local authority in its working group is that the clause should not be a missed opportunity. I listened carefully and did not intervene during the whole debate on clause 5, but I am left feeling exceedingly depressed about the opportunity that could have been afforded by clause 6, particularly when enhanced by our amendments. The high-performing authorities that would have preferred a lighter touch in relation to the delivery of best value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall, perhaps, add to the concern of my hon. Friend when we consider the data that will be used when the reviews are carried out. The plans must be published before the end of the financial year—31 March. Local authorities will publish the plan for the year 2001–02 on 31 March 2001 at the latest, but they will be using the 1999–2000 data, so they will be way out of date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. I think that I have been caught out by the millennial date change. Perhaps the Minister will understand my hon. Friend's point better than I do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some high-performing authorities are afraid that the best value performance plans will be too prescriptive and that a standard formula that impedes the best-performing local authorities will be imposed on them. They would have preferred to include in their best value performance plans their own best ideas and some of the policies that they know work on the ground. They could compare those plans with the very best-performing authority and improve on it. That would have been a better solution. Such a proposal would allow councils to develop, for example, their own review procedures and their own mechanisms for their plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conversely, as the group has mentioned in its studies, it is clear that if authorities demonstrably fail to comply with the best value principle, a more stringent corrective approach would be required. I put the case for the high performers—hence I support the amendment, which would help them to achieve the continuous improvement that the Government would like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whenever the Minister does not grasp a point she claims that it is a contradiction. That is so with comparability. No Opposition Member has argued that comparisons cannot be helpful. Comparisons in local government—for example, among families of local authorities—have been a fact of life for many years. However, the comparisons must be relevant and realistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our argument is that national, uniform comparisons between entirely different local authorities are unhelpful and might be detrimental; they will encourage people to compare and contrast things which cannot be compared and contrasted reasonably and fairly. We object to the uniform nature of the comparisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
I want to make a point about the police. It has already been referred to by the hon. Member for Taunton. It refers back to questions asked in earlier debates to which we received no satisfactory answers. The Minister will be familiar with the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994 and, indeed, with the Policy Studies Institute report on the police—probably the most important report on this aspect of the police in recent years. The report drew particular attention to an aspect of that Act which, according to the authors, had produced a key change in the performance of police forces. The key change, according to the authors, has been the statutory requirement laid upon police authorities to publish a local policing plan with details of objectives and targets for the coming year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the Bill affect the 1994 Act and how will it affect the Home Secretary's powers under section 43 of the Police Act 1996, which requires police authorities to
	<br><blockquote><p>"submit to the Secretary of State a report on such matters connected with the discharge of the authority's functions, or otherwise with the policing of its area, as may be specified in the requirement."</p></blockquote>
Can we have a plain answer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, the Bill will have an impact on the 1996 Act because, by definition, it breaks the tripartite governance of police forces. The tripartite arrangement, which has been the norm in the governance of police forces, will suffer strain under a proposal that sets up a parallel system of consultation—essentially of reporting and accountability to the Minister and the Secretary of State. We need to have some definite answers to those questions; we have had none during previous debates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 143 would require that a best value performance plan should encompass all functions exercised wholly or partly by the authority. As drafted, the clause requires only that the plan accords with relevant orders or guidance. The amendment is therefore unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The performance plan will bring together a full statement of the outcomes of reviews and the extent to which targets have been set and are being met across the range of the authority's activities. The Bill refers clearly to the functions of a best value authority in a number of relevant provisions, not to some of the functions of a best value authority. I assure the Committee that subsequent guidance will reinforce that. There is little to be gained from repeating the all-encompassing nature of best value and I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the performance plans are to be annual documents. The Under-Secretary said that they would include issues that are under review. We agreed earlier that each service would not have to be reviewed annually, thus all services would not have been reviewed within the year to which the performance plan related. Is my understanding of the provision correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0839">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady understands the clause correctly. While remaining flexible so that authorities can review their functions sensibly, we wish to ensure that residents regularly receive up-to-date, reliable information on all the services that they receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 135 would add a requirement on best value authorities to compare themselves only with the best best value authorities, rather than other best value authorities when they produce their performance plans. The guidance that the Secretary of State will issue in England and that the Assembly will issue in Wales under clause 5 (6) (b) will be based on the desire to see authorities comparing themselves to the best and striving to be among the best. When appropriate, the framework will ask all local authorities to be as good as the top quartile. I hope that I have now answered the point that was made by several Opposition Members about how we drive up the standards of local authorities that are already performing more efficiently than the majority of other local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The framework is set out in our local government White Papers. Current provisions provide for an authority to include in its best value performance plan its performance targets and its performance against those targets as currently set out under subsections 2(e) and 2(i) to clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is undesirable because it limits the comparison that authorities can make. Although they will need to compare their performance with that of the best, there may be valid reasons why they will want to publish their performance against that of other groups—for example, neighbouring authorities. That should be a local decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should just like to finish this part of my response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The performance indicators and standards that we shall prescribe under clause 4 will provide the framework for local authorities to compare themselves with one another. After all, that is one of the main reasons for prescribing national performance indicators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would insist that local authorities compare themselves with the best, but that does not mean that they cannot compare themselves with whichever local authority they wish, be it in this country, Canada or anywhere else. The hon. Gentleman's argument is not valid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misunderstands my point. The amendment is not necessary because the Bill provides that the way in which local authorities undertake services can be compared with the very best authorities as well as with neighbouring local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 134 would also restrain flexibility. If the amendment were passed, the Secretary of State or the Assembly could require performance plans to make comparisons with previous years and with other authorities but he could not require them to make only
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
one or other of the comparisons. As the clause stands, the Secretary of State can require either comparison, or both, to be made. We might require a best value authority to make a single comparison only if its performance took a sudden dip in relation to previous years. Comparisons with others in these circumstances would not tell it much. It would need to look at its own performance in that service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is raising doubts about time, so perhaps I may repeat my intervention on the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs Spelman). I understand why the Government wish to set the date of 31 March for publication, but this will mean that the data will be out of date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman understands. Perhaps he will be so kind as to say why he could not have put the publication date back a couple of months to benefit local authorities in assessing themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intention in England is to ensure that the data are audited, assessed and made available as soon as possible. It is not intended to make that the only information available. The auditors will assess more up-to-date information, which could also be provided to local residents, especially if it indicates some great change in the performance of a service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the reason for amendment No. 34. Consultation is a most important element of best value. The amendment would add a summary of the outcomes of consultation to the list of key elements that the Secretary of State, or the Assembly, may specify for inclusions in local performance plans. However, I think that the amendment is inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local performance plans are what their name suggests—a statemt of authorities' performance in delivering local services. They are intended to provide local people with information about how the authority is performing, what performance targets it has set for future years and the outcome of best value reviews. They are the prime means by which best value authorities are held accountable by the people whom they serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The outcome of consultation will be subsumed in the range of matters set out by the best value authority in local performance plans. Discussions of performance will reflect local people's views. Future performance targets will reflect their aspirations. Audit and inspection arrangements will check that consultation has been carried out properly under the general duty of best value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us imagine that, in a performance plan for one year, a local planning authority said that it aimed to deal with 95 per cent, of development planning applications within a specified period and, as a result of consultations with the public and a list of consultees, it decided that it would not mind that being dropped because it wanted better
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0840">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
quality development control—for example, wider consultation with neighbours and more negotiation with developers, more planning gain or more decisions going as the public wished. If, the following year, the authority decided in its performance plan to up the speed at which it would consider applications, would not it be relevant to the public to know that the results of the consultation exercise were that the authority wanted a completely different indicator to be given a higher priority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Lady and I share the same intention. We both wish there to be genuine consultation, and our shared aim is to achieve the objectives that local authorities share with the people whom they represent. However, we must be careful that we do not unduly complicate the consultation procedure and make it unworkable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had answered that point. I will not give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultation results need neither to be summarised separately in the local performance nor spelt out in the Bill. Doing so would add unnecessarily to the content of the plan and add a new layer of bureaucracy. I trust that Opposition Members will understand that approach and withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we are all agreed that performance plans should be aimed at local people not at the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 143 was intended to probe Government thinking on performance plans and the response gave us some indication of that. We are therefore happy to withdraw it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that consultation was an important element but implied that it was not the key element. Another important element of performance plans is that people should actually read them. It is a challenge for authorities to produce plans that will be read by the public at large. Only last week I saw a best value plan put forward by a housing authority which ran to around 40 or 50 pages. The public's response was, "stick it onto one side and we will look at it." People did not want to wade through 40 or 50 pages which could be seen as intended to obscure rather than illuminate the message. It would serve the public interest if the plan included some material on the results of the consultation exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that the Minister is not convinced by my arguments so we shall not press for a Division. I would like to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Amendment No. 35 deals with the date by which authorities must have published their plans. It is, I know, another predictable attempt by the Liberal Democrats to remove some of the Secretary of State's order-making powers. We are now down to 24 or 25: if the Committee meets for a few more sittings we might get that figure down even further and have a Dutch auction on who has achieved the most.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to probe the Minister on why the Secretary of State needs the power to specify by order an alternative date. Is the provision designed to loosen the shackles on local government or to tighten them? Is it intended that the Secretary of State can vary the date for individual authorities or will it apply to all authorities? Does the Secretary of State share the view of the Local Government Association that the 31 March deadline may be too tight? We seek clarification from the Minister. If we are happy with her response, this may turn out to be one of the orders that we welcome because it could provide some flexibility for authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be interested to hear the answer to that question raised by the hon. Member for Taunton, but I rise to deal with amendment No. 136. Whether or not the clause is to include consultation, there must surely be openness. To avoid any doubt about that we propose to add three new subsections. Thus a best value authority should arrange for its performance plan to be published within 28 days of completion; provision should be made for council tax payers to make representations about the plan; and representations and submissions should be published within a reasonable time of receipt.

The best value review is based on the consultation in clause 3 (2), so should not the local electors know what the consultation is about? Should we not specify that the outcome of the process should be made absolutely clear? As the clause stands, the formulation of a best value plan could remain entirely confidential. There is no provision for the Secretary of State to publish the plans but we should put an obligation on the local authorities or the Secretary of State to make sure that they are put into the public doman so that there can be a proper public debate on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments aim to alter the date on which local performance plans need to be published. I appreciate the way the hon. Lady moved her amendment. In many senses we want to see the

	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
early publication of the local performance plan at a year end and, in many centres, that lies at the heart of what we are seeking to achieve. The clause already provides for a publication date of 31 March. That is much clearer than an open-ended requirement to publish the plan within 28 days of its completion. When would the completion date be? It could be when an authority determined. These things can slip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important aspect of the publication is that it serves the democratic purpose. Local people need to know how local authorities are performing when they exercise their democratic choice in the May local government elections. That is why we settled on 31 March. It is important that plans are published then so that people have time to see them before an election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ability to vary that exists partly because the local government associations were concerned that there may be exceptional things in exceptional years. If we changed the election dates—I am not saying that we are although that was one suggestion in the White Paper—a different date would be appropriate for those pilots. We simply wanted to ensure that there was flexibility to respond to such matters and to make it clear that the date is linked to the democratic process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The contrary view, which I am sure that the hon. Lady has considered, is that the party in power, whatever party it is, will use that as an opportunity to colour the advance into the election period on public funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is always that possibility which is why guidance about the nature of the performance plan is important. But it is also important that it is published by 31 March. I am confident that Opposition parties are quite capable of spotting things like that and, were any authority silly enough to try that, of making good political capital out of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Lady envisage that a local authority's performance plan would be subject to a full vote in the council before it was endorsed as the council's plan?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an amendment of that nature and I will come to that in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the Secretary of State might use his power to vary by order if election dates were changed in different authorities. Will different authorities be given different dates? That was what I meant when I asked whether a blanket power would apply to all authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to be helpful when I answered that question. In the past, there have been arguments about changing the financial year in local government. If that were done, clearly the order would relate to all authorities. However, I do not want to be drawn into the realms of fantasy. We responded to representations that there should be more flexibility than would be allowed by giving a single date of 31 March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 136 would undermine authorities' accountability to local people by blurring the publication date. We need a common publication date
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
so that the comparison of performance information between best value authorities takes place on a common basis and at an early stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Bill makes provision for cases in which it would be appropriate for the Secretary of State to vary such a requirement. That might arise if the timetable for reviewing functions, collecting performance information, auditing and inspecting the activity, needed to be adjusted in light of practical experience. That is a necessary safeguard, so I do not accept amendment No. 35.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parts of amendment No. 135 dealing with challenge are unfeasible. Clause 7 makes it clear that performance plans will be audited by the authority's auditor. The audit of those plans will be comprehensive. When an auditor's report identifies serious deficiencies in a performance plan, the auditor may recommend follow-up action by the best value inspector or by the Secretary of State under his powers of intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill makes provision for auditors to certify the performance plan within three months of publication, that is by 30 June. It would be neither proper nor desirable to open the plans to public challenge before the auditor's certification. It would be unrealistic to require an authority to publish a performance plan that includes an auditor's certificate, because the timing of the audit will not be in the authority's direct control. A 28-day period for challenge is clearly unworkable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A requirement to publish submissions and responses to challenges would be onerous. I agree that it is essential that local people have as much information about their council's performance as is practical. However, I am conscious of what the hon. Member for Mole Valley said about the risk of information overload, and am, therefore, determined that best value information published by councils must be presented clearly and concisely. A requirement to publish submissions and responses would lead to the risk of local people being swamped in a plethora of unwieldy documents. However, when there is a overwhelming case for publishing information, we will do so. Government amendment No. 56 requires best value authorities to publish auditors reports relating to their performance plans.
