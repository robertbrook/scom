I am sure that the Government are trying to be helpful, but we are still receiving information that is relevant to the conduct of the Bill. I have a letter from the Minister saying that the Committee has concluded consideration of part I but enclosing a document relating to clauses 4 to 6 of the Bill. On walking into the Lobby today, I find that we are receiving new information about parts of the Bill that have already been passed. Is that a satisfactory way for a Committee to proceed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>542</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provision of information relating to the Bill is entirely a matter for the appropriate Minister and Department. It is not a matter for me. Madam Speaker and the Chair have made it clear that they deprecate the late arrival of relevant papers, but it is for the Minister to decide whether they should have been made available earlier and whether there is a case to answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mole Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you recall, Mr. Gale, the Opposition are, as ever, helpful, and we are trying to help the Minister. My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) assisted the Committee with a clear explanation of the council tax benefit subsidy. By the time he finished, it was obvious to everyone how it worked and why the clause was necessary. I shall not add to that, which would make matters even more complicated, rather I wish to develop a point that I made in an intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A local authority's application is based on the 1998–99 council tax and standard spending assessment. In some areas, local authorities face difficulties and their expenditure is below SSA. I mentioned Brent and Newham earlier. On the basis of SSAs, there can be no doubt that those authorities have problems. I concluded that they included 19 of the 22 poorest councils in the country. They will be hit hard by the scheme in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon said, the most hurt will be the nearly poor. Capping will hit harder across particular poor areas. As the hon. Lady on the Liberal Democrat Front Bench, the hon. Member for—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Taunton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you. Taunton in Somerset. Yes, lovely apples and scrumpy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the issue, the net effect will be savage. To my knowledge, this is the first time that any Government have not accepted the SSA as the minimum. Normally, one would anticipate that, as the provisions in the clause are implemented, the Government would assume that the SSA was the minimum and that any council spending below it would be brought back up to that level. But the Minister and her colleagues seem to have some macho need to continue down this line, despite the fact that in local authorities, particularly in areas like inner London, Labour members, Tory members and even independent members oppose it. Labour Back Benchers, although they will not dare to step out of line, are also deeply concerned, yet the Minister seems determined to go ahead. Perhaps an indication of that was her response to amendment No. 201, which seeks to remove one of the other difficulties that have bugged us right across the Bill, which is that it is selective and subjective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a repeat here of the subjective approach that is available to the Minister should she wish to chop and change the way in which the clause is applied to the precepting authorities in an unprecedented way. The Minister accepted that there are other reasonably simple ways of doing that. Since the definition of the SSA seems to have changed over the last couple of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I1031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
years and seems to be adjusted to suit whatever Ministers wish it to say, amendment No. 201 could be accepted to allay some of the concerns of local authorities and of some of her Back Benchers on the subjectivity of the clause. The Minister should think carefully. I know that she has come up with a macho stance and said that the Government want to push ahead, but she should accept that there are other ways of doing it without making this already dubious clause even more subjective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many aspects of the clause have a familiar ring. Amendment No. 201 refers to the need for the same principles to be applied to the same authorities when assessing the limit. The clause is familiar because it is awfully similar to schedule 1. We are talking of a form of capping and the LGA's main complaint is that the clause represents the continuation of crude and universal capping by another means. That again is something of a betrayal of the Government's election promises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the familiar sight of a small and modest amendment from the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead), which has identical wording to that which he wished to apply to clause 23. Once again, this is a matter that affects the ability of local authorities to determine their own spending. That, we fear, is the real motive. If this is welfare reform I will eat my hat. This is reduction of Government expenditure and it is a way of persuading local authorities not to raise their spending levels above certain limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That harks back to the old system of grants and penalties that was abolished in the early 1980s. That was the system introduced by the previous Labour Government in the mid 1970s, after the then Secretary of State had said that the party was over, to penalise authorities by removing their grant. This goes back to a similar method of expenditure control. It is a form of crude and universal capping, which is opposed by many local authorities, and certainly by the Local Government Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government have a mandate for the scheme described by the Minister? Clearly, they did not have a mandate to continue crude and universal capping, which they explicitly denigrated in opposition. However, as we have already heard, the manifesto did not mention any kind of council tax benefit limitation scheme. We can only surmise that such a scheme might be one of those ubiquitous extensions of manifesto commitments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's comments on amendment No. 39 were revealing and untenable. Of course, whether the Bill, and clause 24 in particular, becomes law is the key test of parliamentary authority for council tax benefit limitation. Should the clause not become law, clearly Parliament will not have consented to such a form of council tax benefit limitation. As the regulations are due to be discussed next Wednesday, it would be inadvisable for the Government to proceed on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
existing basis. Should the House reject clause 24, it would be unlikely to give consent to other clauses, even if they were stuffed into a Committee and became law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the test of the Government's authority on such policy. The Minister's colleagues have organised the business of the House so that secondary legislation on council tax limitation is debated and decided in Committee before the Bill completes all its stages in the House. That gives the game away. When tested by her Back Benchers, the Minister will say that it would be perverse not to put the measure in place, given that the House has agreed to all the other measures. However, it would be perfectly reasonable for Government Back Benchers to resist that logic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chamberlain Government did not fall because it lost on a substantive motion or a Bill, or even because it lost a Division. It fell as a result of a substantial vote against the Adjournment of the House. Should the clause fail to become law, the policy under consideration will fall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parish precepts are important. However, clause 24 does not refer to them. The scheme will ensure that the cost of setting higher tax levels will generally fall on the local taxpayer, rather than the national taxpayer. When a council sets a tax level above the Government's guideline increase—which is 4.5 per cent, for the year 1999–2000—the cost of the resulting additional council tax will be met locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, the loss of income that a council suffers as a result of council tax benefit is made good by the benefit subsidy that is provided by the Government. The Government contribute only 95 per cent, of the cost, so there is already a minor clawback. In Colchester borough council in my constituency, the balance is absorbed by the billing authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new scheme, the cost of council tax benefit will have to be paid for by any authority that increases its council tax above the guideline. For example, in my constituency, if Colchester borough council were to increase its budget above the guideline, the loss of subsidy would be made good either by further increasing the council tax or by absorbing the extra cost within the budget. Currently, Colchester is planning to set a council tax for the next financial year that is no higher than the 4.5 per cent, guidline. However, the parish precepts are not in the control of the borough council, although they are included as part of the council's budget requirement for tax-setting purposes. I fully admit that that was a consequence of the Conservative Government's capping legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the hon. Member for Taunton will agree that we should explore whether parish precepts should be included in the calculations, especially when they are below a certain level. It means that, should the parishes in aggregate increase their precepts by more than 4.5 per cent., Colchester borough council would either have to absorb the increase or set a council tax above the guideline. That is indeed the case with a matter yet to be determined by the council. The cost of absorbing the increase above the guideline is not significant: it is about £23,000, not a huge sum, but the principle seems unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I1032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>545</span>
The matter was raised by Colchester borough Council as part of the settlement consultation, but the council felt that it was greeted by a brick wall. What will the Minister do about that unfairness? Why should a perfectly well-behaved district council suffer the risk of council tax limitation because of the actions of precepting authorities that are outside its control? The purpose of the clause is to protect the billing authority from the consequences of other authorities, but it fails in that respect with regard to parish councils. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain why.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, on the distribution of information, I made it clear that I want the Committee to have whatever information is available. The hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) was being rather mischievous. Last night, I circulated a report published by the Audit Commission which assesses its current work on performance indicators and its future work in respect of negotiations with the Local Government Association. That information was not necessary for the debate but it contributed to an understanding of the new legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We continue to develop policy even after the House has debated an issue. I want to ensure that all Members have as much information as possible. The document referred to was not directly relevant to the debate but I felt that Members may want to see it. I hope that I may continue to feel confident about circulating information of that sort without rather silly points being made by Opposition Members. It would be easy for Ministers to retreat and say, "Okay, we're not going to leave ourselves open to criticism," but that is not how the Committee works, and it is certainly not the way I work. I do not feel defensive about having made that information available to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause and this set of amendments relate to the technical amendment to the provision for the new scheme which ensures that increases in council tax which result in increased council tax benefit are borne by local as well as national taxpayers. As Opposition Members made clear, the issues in the regulations are subject to secondary legislation under existing powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of general points that I did not refer to when discussing the Government's amendments were raised during discussions of the first group. The hon. Member for Mole Valley was right to say that the Government regard the issue of SSAs as a matter of distribution. Standard spending assessments are the means by which central Government grant is distributed. They take account of differences in population needs and the differing demographic and social characteristics of an area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's definition mirrors that in the local government finance report, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The calculation makes use of information reflecting demographic physical and social characteristics of each area."</p></blockquote>
Last year's report defined the SSA as representing
	<br><blockquote><p>"an appropriate level of budget requirement to provide a standard level of service."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
There is a marked difference there. If I were a cynical local government finance officer I would consider that the first definition gave me something on which to peg an understanding, which was that it was based on need, whereas the second definition, which the Minister used, was sufficiently vague for me to think that the SSA means whatever the Minister wishes it to mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's perspective because he used the first definition throughout his time in office. We have increased fairly substantially this year the amount going to SSAs. The clear issue seemed to me to be that the amount of SSA depended not upon an assessment of need but almost on how much grant was being distributed. The significant changes this year reflect the increased amount to be distributed. SSAs are a combination of a series of methodological inquiries which reflect assessments of need, demographic change, sparsity, density and all the other items that go into the makeup of SSAs, as well as demographic changes as regards population, school pupil numbers and so on. They are used to distribute grant. We felt it right properly to reflect in the report what actually happens, which is that, following the methodological outcome, we distribute grant in a particular way, including data and so on. We are now stating that much more clearly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister is saying clearly is that she and her colleagues are making it mean what they wish it to mean, and that the importance of need, and its indicators, are not being given the same status and importance as previously. That rather explains some SSA results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a great capacity for misinterpreting things with which he does not agree. I did not say that. We changed the methodology significantly last year, better to reflect need, and we did so again this year for children's social services. The hon. Gentleman will admit that the figure relates as much to the overall sum that is being distributed as to the methodology used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The methodology is used to divide a global sum, not to identify the sum needed in an area. That is clear and always has been clear to me because the previous Administration, while saying that they were responding to need, continued to reduce the global sum that was available and thus in some people's eyes continued to reduce it year on year. This is not strictly relevant but I was seeking to respond to what the hon. Gentleman brought up—he has raised it before. I was anxious to explain to the Committee exactly what we had done. It may also be true—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may also be true that we have undertaken a review because we are not satisfied with precisely how things work at present. If the hon. Gentleman's interest continues, I hope he will contribute to that review. He knows that there are enormous flaws and difficulties in the way that SSAs have been constructed and how that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I1033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>547</span>
affects distribution. It is important that we do what we can. We can never get a perfect system that satisfies everyone, but we can get a better system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides for this technical addition to the scheme to ensure that accountability for such increases in payments of council tax benefits is allocated to the appropriate local level. It provides that if the amount calculated by a major precepting authority as its budget requirement is excessive, it shall make payments to the billing authorities to which it is due the precepts. Whether the amount is excessive will be determined with reference to criteria specified and published by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon in going through the regulations talked about the difference between this and what was going on in Wales and Scotland. I told him then that I did not believe that what he was saying was strictly true. The difference between the systems in Scotland and Wales, as he knows, means that it is incredibly difficult to find strictly comparable sums. A much higher proportion of the overall amount available to local government in Wales comes from central Government. Therefore the amount raised through council tax is much smaller and the gearing mechanism is much higher. It is difficult to compare, as he tried to do this morning, the impact of the different regulations on the two different local government finance schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Curry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Skipton and Ripon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are highly geared councils in England too, so some councils in England will have the same characteristics as councils in Wales and Scotland. Perhaps the hon. Lady could write to me, or I could write to her. We could examine councils and analogous circumstances. The Minister could let me know what would happen under the regulations in analogous councils in Wales, England and Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that there are councils with similar local government finance systems because there are significant differences between all authorities in England and all authorities in Wales. Therefore, it would be misleading to suggest that they were directly comparable. I am not trying to be awkward. I do not want to take the Committee down a path that does not lead to enlightenment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Irrespective of the reasons, the clawback level is lower in Scotland and Wales than in England, The regulations are different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the regulations are different. In England, there will be a graded scheme, while there will be flat-rate scheme in Wales and Scotland. If a Welsh authority joins the scheme, it will take the whole amount immediately. That is not true in England. Therefore, it is impossible to make comparisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>548</span>
I am happy for the right hon. Gentleman to write to me. I could try to explain the matter to him in other ways. Making comparisons is not as simple as the right hon. Gentleman suggests. However, I do not suggest that he is trying to mislead the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Essex asked about parish councils. I thought that we would discuss them in the debates on other amendments, which deal specifically with parish councils. I accept that they are tabled by Liberal Democrat Members, but I shall consider the matter of local precept in the debate on those amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon and the hon. Member for Mole Valley gave their interpretation of the essence and detail of the scheme. We shall debate the matter later. I outlined the Government's position this morning. I do not accept Conservative Members' interpretation of our intentions. If the hon. Member for Mole Valley examines the council tax rates of Newham and Hackney, he will realise that the measure will not affect them. One of those councils has set a 2 per cent, increase; another does not intend to increase its council tax—Lambeth is reducing its council tax. Those councils, which cover many council tax benefit recipients, will not be affected by the measure because they are budgeting responsibly and keeping their council tax low. They are not even approaching the 4.5 per cent, guideline because they have decided to keep the council tax low, perceiving that as in council taxpayers' interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would be the situation in north Yorkshire, given a 9.6 per cent, increase in council tax because the additional SSA for education does not cover all the additional needs? That has been given a passport through, entirely, but there is still a cut in school budgets. There has also been a £3 million cash cut in social services because of the changes in methodology to which the Minister has just referred. That council tax increase is necessary to sustain services. It is not an irresponsible act by North Yorkshire county council. Electors in the constituency of the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) have just voted for around a 9 per cent, increase. Is that irresponsible, because both instances fall well above the guidelines?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to reply now, but she may want to follow the matter up by providing me—and the hon. Member for Milton Keynes North-East, if he is interested—with an account of how the clause would have affected my local authority if it had been in force in the past year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the right hon. Gentleman that information because I do not think that north Yorkshire has yet, set a council tax; it may have done. In any case we cannot provide the information because it depends on the level of the relevant collection fund, among other things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept the right hon. Gentleman's contention that the education SSA does not fund everything that is needed. He knows that councils, like Government and all other public bodies, are expected
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I1034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>549</span>
to make proper efficiency savings as well as taking advantage of additional funding. This year north Yorkshire has received substantially more in the way of increased SSA that it ever did during the right hon. Gentleman's years as a Minister and it did not then make the same noises. I understand that that is politics, but I do not accept that it has had a bad deal on education. Its overall settlement is better than it has been for years, and its education settlement is substantially better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is simply not the case. I suggest that the Minister should explain her view to the leader of the Labour group in north Yorkshire, who first proposed a high council tax increase of around 7 per cent., when originally, it was intended to use some of the education money to help social services. He then voted for the proposed 9.6 per cent, when the ruling Conservative group proposed it. The Minister has not convinced her party's leader in north Yorkshire that her arithmetic is correct. If one takes into account the SSA, the number of small primary schools in north Yorkshire, the demands of teachers' pay—both the overhang and this year's—the pupil rolls increase and the other demands, it is apparent that the arithmetic does not add up. It does not add up in dozens of shire counties. Failure to make the necessary economies is not the point. The sums do not add up. What happened in the past is not relevant to the Minister's present claims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am the most tolerant and mild-mannered of men, but interventions should be interventions not speeches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In 1995–96, a year of huge rises following huge rises, in interest rates and so on, North Yorkshire County Council received the princely increase of 1 per cent. This year it has a 4.7 per cent, increase. I consider that a fair settlement, on the basis of which the council must make decisions that it is prepared to uphold. The decision to make a 9.6 per cent, increase was not taken in consultation with the Government. It is the council's responsibility to take that decision. However, the Government have to pick up some of the tabs through benefit payment on council tax. The principle is that the responsibility for determining council tax has ramifications outside north Yorkshire: it has ramifications for the national taxpayer through council tax benefit. That is the basis on which we argue that some of the responsibility should be shared.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument that the Minister advanced also applies to housing benefit subsidy reduction. Does she recall that her party opposed that throughout the years of Tory Government? Furthermore, not long ago, similar views were put on record in an Adjournment debate secured by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) when it was stated that the Government would take action as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that the same applies to housing benefit. Only other council tenants have to accept the burden of additional housing benefit; but all
	<span class='label label-info column'>550</span>
council tax payers in an area—north Yorkshire and elsewhere—will be affected by these provisions. The principle is about who picks up the tab. I accept that local government would like central Government to continue to take the whole burden. However, if councils decide to put council taxes up beyond the Government's guideline amount, they will have the responsibility to share that additional burden with the national taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been trying to give way to the hon. Member for Mole Valley.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take the Minister back before the helpful intervention of my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon. We were discussing some inner London councils and the Minister said that their council tax had been set so low that they would not be affected. That may be so: I have not followed the percentage increases. However, the reality is that, after much pleading, a special grant was set up, which benefited most of the inner London authorities and effectively saved them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My earlier point was that the council tax benefit subsidy is set on last year's expenditure. In the case of the inner London authorities, it was set at below SSA—and the system is on-going. So the Minister may be right this year, but she may not be next year or any other year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made it clear that the provision is about the level of rise in council tax. We have made no equivocation about that. I find the hon. Gentleman's arguments about needs and SSAs rather peculiar. On the one hand he says, "this is the level of need", yet he justifies spending below it. That puts a different gloss on an SSA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Council tax rises have an impact on council tax benefits. The clause is necessary because we have to deal with that. It applies across the board to all authorities because of the criteria that we have set this year—a consistent and common guideline for all categories of authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister therefore saying that, merely because their circumstances were such that for one year they spent below SSA, the councils that I mentioned earlier—Brent, Ealing, Lewisham, Newham and so on are not areas of need? In other years, especially if the SSAs are massaged as they appear to be at present, will not those councils be in some difficulty setting their council tax? The council tax might be set at a higher level in the following year or there might be a higher percentage increase, but it will be referred back to the time when the council's expenditure was below its SSA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I1035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>551</span>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is in dangerous territory, given that the Opposition argued in a previous debate that spending from one year to another should not be taken into account. However, inconsistencies are always possible. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] What I am saying is clear: the measure relates to council tax increases. The issue is not whether the Government are making a pronouncement on need but our saying that if there is a rise in national taxpayers' liability over which they have no control, those who set that higher level have to bear some of the responsibility. The proposal is about responsibility.

and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'The Secretary of State's criteria may refer to'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 202, in page 14, line 32, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3A) 'No local authority budget requirement shall be considered excessive if the associated precept, expressed as the corresponding Council Tax amount at band D is less than the average amount for authorities of the same class, where the class comprises four or more authorities'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are replicas of those we discussed in schedule 1. They would remove some of the Bill's subjectivity and get the Minister to accept that local government does not appreciate that subjectivity. It is a flaw in the Bill's approach, especially in this clause, where the application of the regulations is open to the potential of subjective selection. We want the Government to consider an approach that the Local Government Association will more readily accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 202 would not allow the Secretary of State to require payment from major precepting authorities to billing authorities if the major precepting authorities' band D council tax was below average for its class. Leaving aside the inequality in respect of billing authorities in the same position, which would not be excluded from the scheme, the amendment misses the point. The hon. Gentleman is perhaps aware that he has ended up in a different position in his present incarnation from that in his previous life. The authority in his previous life would not benefit from the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Leaving aside extraneous references, I remind the Committee that it would be open to the Minister to alter the nature of the scheme. It is
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>
unrealistic of the hon. Lady to persist in discussing the clause as if we were talking about the sticking plaster on her scheme, which is to be discussed in Committee next week. If the amendment were accepted the regulations that will be discussed next week would have to be withdrawn and the policy behind them altered, and reintroduced to reflect the nature of the amendments. The hon. Lady knows that, so it would be more grown up if she just accepted it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure, Mr. Gale, what you would say were I to respond to amendments that were not amendments to the clause. It is my responsibillity to deal with amendments that are on the amendment paper, which is what I am attempting to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 203, like amendment No. 201, which we have discussed, would restrict the Secretary of State to a set of principles that applies equally to all authorities when deciding whether a budget requirement is excessive. I went through that in some detail this morning, and explained why we sought to maintain the ability, at least at some stage, to differentiate between different types of authority or decide whether certain exclusions that would benefit a specific type of authority should operate. I gave the example of our occasionally wanting to exclude a certain type of precepting authority. The provision is written as if it is in the Bill largely as a result of representations that we received during consultations. Therefore I must resist the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the link between payment and excess, the amount of the payment is related to the excess in that we estimate that some, or all, of the council tax benefit results from the excess. I hope that the Member for Mole Valley will not press the amendments. I cannot discuss amendments to regulations now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, the whole point was to make sure that the Minister understood the considerable disquiet among Opposition Members and in local government over the Bill's selectiveness of approach generally, which clause 24 re-emphasises. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 101, in page 15, line 3, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(ff) requiring a local precepting authority to supply information to a billing authority to which the precepting authority has power to issue a precept'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 102, in page 15, line 31, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(12) This section shall not apply to a local precepting authority'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already touched on the matter of local precepting authorities. The amendments are probing measures to aid clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the clause refers only to major preceptors. Local precepting authorities such as parish and town councils are outside the scope of the council tax benefit subsidy limitation scheme. But the effect of their precepts on billing authorities is not outside the scheme, so their precept could take a billing authority
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I1036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>553</span>
over the threshold. When we debated the de minimis level for best value, the Minister said that some town councils had a budget of approximately £1 million, so we are not talking of small sums, although we are talking about a small number of councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 101 would bring parish and town councils within the scope of the clause, so that they would have to supply information to the billing authority if their precept took them over the limit. Amendment No. 102 would spell out in the Bill the fact that the provision would not apply to local precepting authorities, therefore that their precept would not take the billing authority over the scheme's threshold. Will the Minister clarify how this would work in practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be entirely happy if the Minister would deal with my earlier points about local precepting authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 101 and 102 do not, by any stretch of the imagination, address that point. Indeed, I know of no local precepting authorities that do not automatically supply information to the billing authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 102 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This section shall not apply to a local precepting authority".</p></blockquote>
That is problematic. A reference to local precepting authorities is needed in the Bill to protect local billing authorities from the effects of decisions that local precepting authorities may make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a great fan of parish councils. For a period, I was vice chairman and then chairman of a parish council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It shows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many Labour Members must be extremely jealous of such a grass-roots experience. The great thing about being a parish councillor is that one does not get any Government grant. There are no SSAs and, until this Bill came along, there was little interference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Gentleman has forgotten the delight of passing the bill to someone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not entirely true. In many authorities, the parish rate is additional to that set by the county and the district. That is always a bone on contention. In many Conservative districts and boroughs, local authorities generously absorb the parish precept in a flat-rate council tax across the whole borough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, Colchester borough council, in my constituency, takes a vindictive approach to rural areas. People living in such areas who have a parish council must pay extra council tax. Living outside the main conurbation already involves extra expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that parish councils exist. The first part of the Bill recognises their existence by bringing them into the bureaucracy of best value. However, they do not exist when it comes to taking their rates into account. We may be dealing with
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
relatively small amounts of money, but it is unfair that the billing authority should take the rap for excessive increases in parish council rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should examine ways of developing parish councils because they are the local government level that is closest to the people. At the moment, they play a relatively small role in the delivery of services. However, many parish councils in larger villages and small towns should have a bigger role in such delivery. We do not want parish councils to get tangled up in controversy, creating even more tension between them and district and borough councils. To avoid that, the Minister must address the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, have been involved with parish and town councils. Before becoming a Minister, I was president of the Durham association of town councils. I am, therefore, well aware of the value of parish and town councils and of the National Association of Local Councils' wish that their members should play a full part in the local government family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have examined the matter carefully and taken time to consider other ways forward. There are many parish councils. No one has a list of them, which is extraordinary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that rather encouraging as it means that big brother is not out there for parish councils. The longer the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions does not have a list, the more parish councils can prosper in the privacy of their own villages and towns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that the hon. Gentleman has now made the case for not supporting the amendment. In some areas, district councils devolve powers or responsibilities to local councils, sometimes for the best of reasons and sometimes so that they can move some of the financial responsibility for their council tax to the parish precept. Because we do not have a list and do not monitor them, we have no means of controlling or even knowing about that and, therefore, of separating out where that is happening and where the parish is simply raising a local precept in order to do the specific things that parishes by law are entitled to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must, therefore, decide whether to exclude parishes and say that what the parish spends is irrelevant to the billing authority. The hon. Member for North Essex has begun to see the flashing light. If we did that, many districts would be tempted to avoid their liabilities in terms of raising council tax by devolving it to the parish because it was exempt. However, because parish electors are not voting for the tier of government which contributes to council tax benefit—the 5 per cent, at present—there is not the relationship there to force the parish to take this seriously and recognise that it would be imposing burdens on a wider scale than simply to its own taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I1037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>555</span>
Widespread as parishes are, particularly in rural areas, they are not universal within a county area for example. There will be some pockets where there are no parishes. There is a tradition of parish councils in one part of my constituency and not in the other where it has not been possible to raise any interest in them. I was intrumental in persuading one area to think about it, but, after much publicity, only four people came to the public meeting to express any interest in having a parish council. There was a fair amount of hostility in the rest of the village.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that local precepts should not be excluded and, because the local precept may push the billing authority into liability for council tax benefit subsidy limitation, we recognise that someone will have to pay. If one considers all authorities, it would be totally unfair to say that some responsibilities can be devolved to the parish, if there is one, and thus avoided. I accept that we are considering a difficult matter, but, after a great deal of thought and debate, I believe that we have reached the fairest conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Specific amendments were tabled to try to tease out the matter and to give hon. Members an opportunity to present their arguments. However, I cannot agree that parish councils should contribute to the costs of benefit. There are more than 8,000 local precepts. That would make administration even more difficult. We do not even have one list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 101 relates to supplying information. Simply doing that would not bring parishes into the scheme. I was not sure whether the hon. Member for Taunton wanted parishes to be in the scheme or to be forgotten. We can do neither. We must acknowledge that some parishes have significant spending power and, therefore, that their precept is important. We should avoid the temptation to juggle around financial responsibility, and delegate for the wrong motive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian White 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many authorities have a long history of working with parishes. I hope that the scheme can accommodate that, and promote those fruitful relationships in which shared expenditure has benefited local people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I agree. Parishes supplement rather than obstruct the work of district councils. They are an important means of making people believe that their council looks after local issues. The relationship between parish and district councils is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand what the hon. Member for Taunton and others are trying to achieve. I have examined the matter carefully from both angles. I have considered whether it would be sensible to ignore parishes, or whether to enable them to play their part in the scheme. Both options are not feasible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for being frank about her thinking on the matter. However, a knotty problem remains. I should like to present two ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
The Minister views rural district or county councils devolving power to parish councils as dangerous. It is sad to regard that as a danger rather than an opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was very careful not to say that. I said that devolution to avoid responsibility was wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I accept that. Devolving responsibility for an ulterior motive—especially a financial one—would be suspect. The Minister has considered one way of getting round the problem—her point about exclusion. However, to make such an exclusion pure, she would have to exclude altogether the parish rate from council tax benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not rule that out before reflecting on it. Additional discretion could be given to the precepting authority regarding how increases in benefit were applied. A voluntary arrangement could be made with the district council as to how best to deal with any council tax benefit consequences—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister is tutting, drawing breath through her teeth and swooning from her dizzy height in the Department, but that would bring real devolution of responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Sally Keeble 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Northampton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Supposing that model applied in a large city such as Birmingham and a particular parish council decided to deal separately with the council tax benefit implications of its decisions on spending, and supposing that parish council used the model to keep certain groups of people out of their area, what would the hon. Gentleman think of that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To keep certain groups of people out of their area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To price them out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what Labour councils used to do with business under the business rate. The hon. Lady is a long way down the track, fearing what terrible things migh happen to people if councils were given the freedom. That is always the problem—how much should be devolved, and where should responsibility for decisions lie?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not be drawn into the hon. Lady's scenario. I will give way to her again later if she can provide further explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to defeat ideas in favour of devolving responsibility if we always assume that every time we devolve, it will lead to some catastrophe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to prevent the hon. Gentleman from going too far down that route. My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) is hinting that there are many people on low incomes who live in parishes. If a parish assumed a significant number of responsibilities, the council tax would be high. In those circumstances, I doubt whether the hon. Gentleman would support the view that council tax benefit should not be available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister raises an obvious objection, but she assumes that the parish council would be heartless not to do anything about the situation—and I am not sure that that is the correct assumption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consequence would be—in the example explained by my hon. Friend the Minister and myself—that some people, especially in certain Conservative-controlled councils, would have to move out to other housing areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wondered when a party-political point was going to emerge from the hon. Lady's scenario, and it devalues the point she is making. There may be dangers, and the hon. Lady has obviously considered an alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another way to maintain the purity of the scheme and properly include councils is not for the DETR to keep a central list of all parish councils—I admit, a dangerous thing to do—but to create a power for the billing authority to retrieve some of the costs of council tax benefits from parish councils, when necessary. The responsibility for decisions and for the discretions in the scheme would then rest with the billing authority and not with the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be a novel idea for the Government—that councils should have some responsibility for where the money goes. However, it would get round the problem. It would mean that if a billing authority such as Colchester borough council was dealing with a small sum of money it could decide that it was not worth the hassle of administering it, but that if a town such as Wivenhoe, one of the largest settlements in the borough, wanted to raise a much bigger rate or began to acquire more responsibilities, there would always be an option for the billing authority, should it feel that the cost to it was growing excessive, to claw back some of the cost of the council tax benefit. Perhaps something could be negotiated. It is just an idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would auditors say of a council whose borough treasurer explained a gap in its funds by saying, "I am sorry; we did not think this was worth the hassle of collecting?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Business frequently makes such decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Alan Whitehead 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southampton, Test)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite clear about this. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that a local authority that had grown rather fed up with the excessive demands placed on it by an authority with which it was involved could effectively decide to impose a cap and take back the money? Is it a very local capping arrangement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that the hon. Gentleman will vote for exactly the same arrangement to allow the Government to do that to every council in the land. It is interesting that someone like the hon. Gentleman, who evidently believes in local government, is
	<span class='label label-info column'>558</span>
prepared to give those powers to national Government, but not prepared to consider giving them to councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether or not the Minister has explored the options that I have outlined, she is obviously not prepared even to entertain them. That emphasises the centralising nature of the proposals, and the unfair anomaly that exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman just keeps digging deeper holes. He now suggests that we should give to district councils the power to discriminate between parishes in their area. He has said that even after I have explained very carefully that we shall not discriminate by our use of the powers in the Bill, but will observe strict criteria. The hon. Gentleman argues that that approach does not matter and that we should tell local authorities, "Do what you like". I must remind him that some consistency is necessary in operating any aspect of legislation. That is as true for local government as for central Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It ill behoves the hon. Lady, having argued her way through the Bill, particularly with respect to the capping arrangements, to begin arguing for consistency. It is difficult to accept that from her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the Government are determined that the anomaly that I have identified, which, though small, is potentially irritating, will remain. The most important thing in their mind is that they should be in control of the process and no one else should get a look in. That is not satisfactory. While I have some sympathy with the amendments I do not think that I can support them. I am sad that the Government will not do anything about the anomaly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not imagine that such slight amendments on such a minor issue would lead to such a big debate. A couple of the Minister's comments surprised me a bit—including the information that there is no list of parish and town councils. I should have expected there to be a list of precepting authorities, and certainly that district councils would have a list of authorities precepting from them, and that it should not be too difficult to compile a mega-list from all those lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that she did not favour a scheme that would encourage higher tier authorities to pass responsibilities down to lower tier authorities. The scheme cannot differentiate between authorities' objectives when they devolve power. They may have perfectly honourable objectives in devolving power and financial responsibility to a lower tier, or it may be a way of getting round some of the finance problems. When I was a county councillor in Somerset, my council proposed to close the fire station—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Hayes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Holland and The Deepings)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dreadful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In every objective test it was surplus to requirements, as there was another a mile down the road. The town in which the fire station was to close was not happy about it, on the grounds of town pride not of safety, so it decided to pay an annual sum of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I1039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>559</span>
money to enable the fire station to stay open. It was not a case of a higher tier authority deliberately shunting a cost on to a lower tier, but of a lower tier authority using its imagination to retain something that it wanted which would otherwise have been closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments probably would not achieve the Committee's objective, but perhaps the Government, with all the power at their disposal and the brains of their civil servants, will come up with something on Report that will achieve that aim. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 237, in page 15, line 10, after '(6)' insert 'Subject to subsection (9A)—[	<i>Ms Armstrong.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 40, in page 15, leave out lines 12 to 14 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(7) No regulations shall be made under this section unless a draft has been laid before, and approved by resolution of, each House of Parliament.'.</p></blockquote>
I shall be brief, as we have been round the same course on the need to use the affirmative resolution procedure so often that we know the arguments off by heart. It is constitutionally significant that the Government will end their commitment to paying the welfare budget and passing some of it to local authorities. Such a proposal should be subject to affirmative resolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Taunton said, we have been round this course on several occasions. The regulations that require local authorities to charge an appropriate amount of tax to provide for these payments have already been laid as part of the local government settlement process and were debated then. The criteria were available to the House at that time, as will be the case in future. We plan that any regulations under this provision shall also be made at the time, so there will be ample opportunity for debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applied this year. The proposals for the scheme were announced with the provisional settlement, the Secretary of State's decision was announced in the settlement debate and we received verbal and written representation. On both occasions hon. Members could raise and discuss the scheme; it gave them an opportunity to debate the guideline and the merits of the proposals. Clearly, the House can and will use the negative resolution specifically in respect of the regulations. I therefore ask the hon. Lady to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have returned to the issue of proper scrutiny. It is entirely reasonable for these matters to be laid before Parliament. Local authorities will resent it if they are not. Members of both Houses of Parliament should have the opportunity to scrutinise these matters. That would send a signal to local
	<span class='label label-info column'>560</span>
government that we are doing things fairly and properly. The Minister has a lot of catching up to do in her relationship with local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subtle difference with this clause is that it is brought in so that the regulations on council tax benefit subsidy can apply to the precepting authorities. The whole basis is set in time in that the regulations are applied to the year 1998–99 and there will be no opportunity for the House to discuss the changing circumstances for different authorities. The example that the Minister gave previously was purely for one year. It would be nice to have the opportunity to debate it later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the nature of the changes in the Bill, which are not insignificant in extending these things, is a central and crucial departure from previous legislation. It accentuates our argument for having an opportunity to consider the matter over time. As I said—I do not want to test your patience, Mr. Gale—the Minister has a lot of catching up to do. We want to help her in that. Her reputation in local government is plummeting. This is a real opportunity for her to make up the ground by looking again and reconsidering her rather harsh and undemocratic views on this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought it a great opportunity for the Government to test the popularity of this policy with their own Back Benchers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised at the Minister's response. We have had it at least 10 times, if not more, in Committee. The Opposition have the force of argument although the Government have the force of numbers. Doing a quick count, I see that they almost do not have the force of numbers and so it is tempting to push this to a vote. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 194, in page 15, line 21, leave out '60' and insert '70'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This will be even quicker. If my intelligence is correct, our team of experts think that they have spotted a drafting mistake in the Bill and that instead of relating to clause 60 in the Greater London Authority Bill, it should relate to clause 70. If we are right, it should be a simple matter to correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last time the hon. Lady brought intelligence from the Committee along the Corridor, it turned out, on investigation, to be incorrect and an amendment to cap the GLA was merely an attempt to put into the Bill the assurance that had been given by the Minister that the cost of the GLA would be only 3p per elector per year. The Government declined to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this case I rather suspect that if it is a mistake, it reflects the fact that the Greater London Authority Bill is a good deal longer than the Government intended it to be. In an earlier draft it may have been clause 60 but because the Bill has mushroomed overnight as the issues have got increasingly complex and more and more clauses have had to be added to it, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I1040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>561</span>
parliamentary draftsman dealing with this Bill did not quite keep up with its growth. I think we should forgive the Government for that as it is awfully complicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Taunton for tabling the amendment. I realise that it is intended to be helpful. It is a useful reminder to all of us that we must ensure that there is consistency between this Bill and the Greater London Authority Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are aware that the clause and schedule 1 will need to be amended to reflect amendments to the GLA Bill. That is a usual Committee procedure. Clearly Opposition Members do not remember how often Bills were substantially amended under the previous Administration. Therefore, we will introduce Government amendments to ensure that the Bills are compatible: changes to the GLA Bill will be reflected in the Local Government Bill and vice versa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are likely to be further changes to clause numbers in the GLA Bill, so we decided to leave Government amendments until later, when we hope to make all the necessary changes at the same time. I, therefore, ask the hon. Lady to withdraw her amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed, as I hoped that we were about to break our duck. I thought that the Government would give in to the greater argument and, indeed, the truth by accepting our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this benevolent situation, will the Minister allow the hon. Lady to put her name to the Government amendments that will be tabled later? I am sure that that will help in all sorts of campaigns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall resist the temptation to respond to that blandishment. As the matter will be tidied up later, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are minor drafting amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 70 is designed to tidy the drafting of section 8 of the Police Act 1996, after the insertion of clause 8(2)(d) to that Act, as effected by new clause 6, to which the Committee has already agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 71 is designed to ensure that repeals of measures identified in schedule 2 are in accordance with the provisions of clause 18 and the arrangements for commencement of the Bill, as laid out in clause 20. The amendment has been tabled on the advice of parliamentary counsel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Alan Meale)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 69, in page 16, line 4, at end insert

Clause 28 states that, as a general rule, the Bill applies
	<br><blockquote><p>"to England and Wales only".</p></blockquote>
Should the Bill's provisions amend those of another Act, the extent of that amendment is confined to the extent of the Act that it amends. The changes that clause 19 makes to the Audit Commission Act 1998 are an example of that. The latter Act applies to England and Wales, so the Bill's amendments to it apply to England and Wales.

I had in mind a number of titles which would have reflected its import more accurately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It now falls to me, Mr. Gale, to thank you for your diligence and attention to our proceedings, and to request that you pass our thanks to Mr. O'Brien for the chairmanship of the Committee which, in both cases, we have enjoyed enormously. I thank the Clerks and the Minister's civil servants for their liberal assistance throughout. We do not begrudge the Government Front Bench their help because these are complicated matters, and we understand that the Minister is still on a learning curve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether the Back-Benchers of the governing party have enjoyed the Committee quite as much as the rest of us remains to be seen. I should be grateful, Mr. Gale, if you would pass on our thanks to all concerned, including 	<i>Hansard.</i> I also add my thanks to my hon. Friends who have given me sterling support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen flashes of opposition from the Liberal Democrats which has been heartening to us. We enjoyed that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adrian Sanders 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torbay)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Liberal Democrats, I thank you for your excellent chairmanship, Mr. Gale. I also thank Mr. O'Brien. I thank all members of the Committee for the bit of fun that we have had in the past few weeks going through an extraordinarily—some outside might say boring and complex, those inside say fascinating—Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not run through the same list as that which the hon. Member for North, Essex recited; we take that as read. But may I also thank the two Whips who have done Back Benchers and Front Benchers proud by being able to move adjournments and amendments at certain times to ensure that we were able to vote, debate or get home early. Thank you, everyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>564</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, add my sincere thanks to you, Mr. Gale, and to Mr. O'Brien. This evening I frequently almost found myself saying "Mr. O'Brien" because we have been accustomed to seeing you in the mornings and him in the afternoons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, this has been a very friendly Committee, during which we have had our usual exchanges which are less friendly at some times than at others. That reflects the fact that each member of the Committee is committed to local government and to the people who work and serve in it, as well as to the people whom they represent. We have an enormous job to do in Parliament to make our relationship with them such that they can survive. I know that they read about and reflect on our conduct of the Committee. We want to ensure that we do not merely enjoy ourselves but raise the issues that are important to them. We have certainly done that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to thank the Clerks. Our debates have been technical at times and we have needed the assistance of the Chairman and the Clerks. I also want to thank the 	<i>Hansard</i> writers. You have reminded us quite rightly, Mr. Gale, that we have sometimes made their job even more difficult than it is normally. They have nevertheless reported our proceedings effectively and dealt particularly well with our sedentary interventions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to thank all members of the Committee. Attending a Committee is often a means of getting to know other Members better—and to know where they are coming from. I should like to thank my hon. Friends who certainly fulfilled their roles as Government supporters, but also asked questions to ensure that all the issues were thought through. The Committee has finished in good time, not by curtailing debate—we have always had a full debate—but by all of us working so well. That also reflects on the Chair and the Clerks whom we want to thank so much for the way in which the Committee was handled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In responding to those points of order, I should like to thank all members of the Committee. I shall certainly ensure that Mr. O'Brien is aware of all the kind comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to thank member of the Committee for—generally—remaining in order. If they have not done so, that has been the responsibility of the Chair and is also due to the unfailing ingenuity of Members of Parliament, which never ceases to amaze us. More seriously, I want to thank the Committee for the unfailing courtesy and good humour with which our deliberations were conducted. As the Minister said, it has not always been easy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On behalf of all hon. Members I would also like to thank the staff of the House—the police, the Badge Messengers, the 	<i>Hansard</i> writers and the Clerks—without whose sterling efforts on our behalf, this work would be so much more difficult. Thank you all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
