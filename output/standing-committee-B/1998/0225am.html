<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government Bill</h1></div>
<p>9 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Hon. Members may remove their jackets if they wish to do so. We now resume our debate on schedule 1.</span></p>
<div class='schedule'><span class='label label-warning'>schedule</span>
Schedule 1</div> <!-- schedule -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
LIMITATION OF COUNCIL TAX AND PRECEPTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [<i>23 February</i>]: No. 207, in page 17, line 33, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) the Secretary of State shall publish a statement of the set of principles for each financial year on or before 31st December in the preceding year'.—<i>[Mrs. Spelman.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 207 would mean a return to the crude and universal capping policy of the previous Administration. We made a commitment to abolish such capping because we wanted local authorities to take responsibility for deciding their own budgets in light of their spending needs and the available resources—and for local people to have more influence on those decisions.<br><br>
In the past, local authorities tended to set their budget requirements at the level of the capping limit. We want to improve financial accountability, and for that to happen, local authorities will have to take more responsibility for their budgets.<br><br>
As I have already made clear, we hope that the best value changes implemented under the part I of the Bill—plus other changes, such as implementing new political management structures, improving local democracy and introducing a new ethical framework—will help local authorities to modernise and improve. We hope that we shall not have to use the reserve powers to limit council taxes and precepts. Having to publish those capping principles under those circumstances would be redundant.<br><br>
I also point out, in a spirit of friendliness, that there is no requirement under existing legislation to publish the capping principles. However, the previous Administration chose to do so in most, but not all the years during which they implemented it.<br><br>
The amendment is unhelpful, and I ask that it be withdrawn.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 500</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford <span class='memberconstituency'>(Mole Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the blithe words of the Ministser and her "have more faith in me" comments this morning, but even at this early hour, I have considerable difficulty with that.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) and I when we worked in what was then the Department of the Environment, published the principles of capping to make sure that local authorities were aware of how universal capping was and of where they stood: now they do not. The Government should understand that, whatever they might say about previous capping.<br><br>
The point of the amendment is to try to persuade the Government to recognise that there is a lot of underground spluttering going on—with good reason— about schedule 1, and that local authorities are being left entirely in the dark. They can be clobbered in any of four ways without notice. I had hoped that the Minister would think carefully again, recognising that even some of her Back Benchers will be dragged kicking and screaming to vote for it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>:<i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister shakes her head. I wish that she would sometimes look over her shoulder. I realise that the hon. Lady will drive the measure through, which shows how long ago she was last involved directly with local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall not be pressing the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Hayes <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Holland and The Deepings)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 18, line 30, after 'may', insert 'by order'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following: amendment No. 43, in page 18, line 34, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(4) No order shall be made, under this section unless a draft has been laid before, and approved by resolution of, each House of Parliament.'.</p></blockquote>
New clause 4 —<i>Approval of capping principles by affirmative order—</i>
<br><blockquote><p>'.—(1) None of the powers contained in sections 52 B L and P of the Local Government Finance Act 1992, as inserted by Schedule I, shall be exercised unless the relevant order has been approved by affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) Such an order shall specify the principles referred to in Clause 52 (B)(2), 52(L)(2)(b) and 52(P) of that Act.'.</p></blockquote>
Before Mr. Hayes continues, I note that amendment No. 43 is fairly wide ranging. It may be convenient to treat this selection of amendments as a debate on the Schedule as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given your advice, Mr. Gale, I want to return to the fundamental issue that has divided the Committee throughout our debates. I speak of the Secretary of State's increased powers, implicit in the Bill, and the challenge to local choice and discretion that they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I1008">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 501</span>
present. This group of amendments illustrates that difference. Under the amendments, the order that selectively cap, target or pick on local authorities would be laid before Parliament. It is almost unarguable that that should not be so.<br><br>
The orders should be open to parliamentary scrutiny, unless, of course, it is thought that either the authorities picked out for special treatment—I use that term euphemistically—or the parliamentary process is unimportant. Perhaps the Bill is a combination of both those opinions. The Government place a relatively low priority on local democracy. Perhaps the Bill is further evidence that they do not want Parliament to have an opportunity to debate such matters either.<br><br>
Our debates have been civilised, and I have tried to take account of the fact that the Minister has limited practical experience of local government. I have conceded that point in a spirit of generosity. Rather than being theoreticians, other members of the Committee have been at the sharp end.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know, for a couple of years—cursorily.<br><br>
I know that the Minister will say that such matters were not put before Parliament when the previous Government introduced capping. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Sir P Beresford) has said, the very universality of the previous arrangements meant that authorities were not targeted in the way that I have described. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon said during a previous sitting, the publication of guidance and criteria in advance added fairness and comprehensibility to the process. That meant that it was less necessary to have an additional check and balance than it is now, given that authorities may be picked out at the Secretary of State's whim. It has been suggested, by my more draconian hon. Friends, that that might be done for political reasons. An authority that does not find favour from a partisan perspective might be picked on and given special treatment—again, I use that term euphemistically.<br><br>
In those circumstances, it is only fair and reasonable that Parliament should have a chance to scrutinise the process. To do otherwise would be to place into the Secretary of State's hands arbitrary power. That is the chilling aspect of the Bill. The Minister says that the Government had added only 25 new powers, but the depth and breadth of those powers are unprecedented. No hon. Member would now dispute that point—certainly, it is not disputed outside the Committee. The unprecedented transfer of powers to the Secretary of State is widely acknowledged. I am sure that, in the spirit of generosity with which she began the sitting, the Minister will acknowledge that, too, in her reply.<br><br>
These important amendments would introduce an additional check and balance. One of the amendments is largely technical, the other draws attention to such matters. They will be warmly welcomed by all members of the Committee and by local government. If the Government were to accept the amendments, they would show that they have listened to the arguments of the past few days.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 502</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Curry <span class='memberconstituency'>(Skipton and Ripon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: You said Mr. Gale, that the debate on this group of amendments would serve as the debate on the schedule as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me clarify the position. I said that it might be for the convenience of Members to treat this as a debate on the schedule, as a whole. It is up to Members whether they curtail this debate and debate the schedule or whether they want to range fairly freely on this group of amendments. I am simply saying that Members should not expect this Chairman to allow them to do both.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gale, for that clarification.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members want to provide mat the Secretary of State—or, I presume, the National Assembly for Wales—May exercise the powers to designate or nominate an authority only if an order has been made and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament, and that such an order should contain the principles used to decide whether budget requirements are excessive.<br><br>
That is rather different from the existing procedure, introduced and operated by Opposition Members when in government, whereby no requirement exists for an order to be laid before the Secretary of State can designate an authority. Under existing powers, if a local authority is designated, it can challenge the maximum amount set by the Secretary of State, who will consider any relevant information provided by the local authority before deciding whether to cap it. It is only at that point that an order setting out the maximum amount, or cap, which might be different from that proposed when the local authority was designated, will be laid, providing for a debate in the House of Commons, but not in the House of Lords, because it is the custom of the House that financial matters are not debated in the Lords. Obviously Opposition Members want to change that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Essex)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Governments always try to pretend that a Bill that relates to tax raising is, necessarily, a money matter and therefore exempt from being considered by the House of Lords. That custom relates to the Government's tax-raising powers, not powers over local authorities. The Minister would have difficulty in persuading the House of Lords that it had no right to discuss such a resolution. For example, in the past, although Governments claimed that European Community financial Bills are financial matters, the House of Lords has nevertheless rightly discussed them. It is a spending matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that it had not been the custom for the House of Lords to discuss—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that it had not been the custom, and it has not. Previously, designation for capping authorities has been a matter for the House of Commons,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I1009">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 503</span>
and has not been discussed by the House of Lords. Perhaps Opposition Members want to change that practice; perhaps they are trying to do so through the amendment. It has not been the custom to date, and we therefore did not want to change that custom.<br><br>
We intend to follow the procedure that was established by the previous Administration in exercising the new reserve powers, for the following reasons. First, I remind Hon. Members that, especially when an authority is designated for a financial year that has already started, time is very important. To add an additional requirement for a debate in both Houses would delay the designation procedure, and make it much more difficult for a local authority to reduce its budget requirement during the financial year if that proved necessary. Even if a local authority were being designated before the start of that financial year, we envisage that that would take place at around the time of the announcement of the provisional settlement, with any limit being set after the approval of the settlement; and again, there would be little time for an additional, unnecessary step to the procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Minister says about the timetable and about the previous system, which I anticipated in my remarks, as she will remember. The difference in this case is that because particular local authorities will be singled out, hon. Members whose local authorities would be affected will take an especially keen interest in such matters, and might therefore want to scrutinise them in greater detail than would have been the case under a previous, universal regime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have not yet moved to a position whereby Members of the House of Lords represent constituencies and therefore represent a particular area. The hon. Gentleman's point is therefore not pertinent to the current constitutional settlement.<br><br>
Secondly. I cannot agree that it is sensible to debate the issue in either House before the Secretary of State has received any relevant information from the local authority concerned. Under existing capping legislation and the new reserve powers, authorities that are designated or nominated may challenge the maximum amount set by the Secretary of State. In doing so, they provide information to the Secretary of State that may lead him to revise his opinion of the maximum amount. It may even lead him to decide not to proceed—in which case there is no need for a debate.<br><br>
Thirdly, the existing legislation does not provide that the principles have to be published before authorities can be designated. If an authority is designated or nominated under the new powers, it will be informed of the reason, which will be based on the principles. If Opposition Members wish to know those reasons, I am sure that they will ask. In any event, there will be plenty of opportunity to debate the reasons if the Secretary of State decides to propose a cap or notional budget for the local authority.<br><br>
9.15 am<br><br>
I stress that, if an authority is designated or nominated and does not accept the view of the Secretary of State, an order will be laid and mere will be a debate in the House.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 504</span>
That is the sensible time for a debate: after the local authority has had an opportunity to consider and respond to the Secretary of State's view—and after, not before, the Secretary of State has had the opportunity to consider the information put forward by the local authority and decide whether or not to proceed, not before.<br><br>
The measure deals with the difficult question of where the balance between local authorities and the House should be struck. It is important that the authority be given the opportunity to look at the principles and decide whether it is prepared to act within them before the House does so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One thing that the Minister has not put into a timetable is the possibility that the House, in Committee or directly, will examine the order and reject it. That would leave an authority that has worked on the assumption that the order will not be rejected in something of a quandary; it may even have got as far as printing its billing and so on. How would the Minister fit that into the timetable and allow for the additional costs that would initially apply but then be revoked if the Committee rejected the Secretary of State's proposal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is always a problem in dealing with local government and constitutes part of the relationship between this place and local government; it is a problem that the hon. Gentleman had to face when he was a Minister. It is why I am keen that we do not establish a relationship in which Parliament is master at every step of the way. We want local government to take more responsibility in its actions and decisions, recognising that Parliament will ultimately have a say in agreeing the overall settlement and in agreeing specific elements of the settlement, which may go as far as designating one or more authorities. The amendments are unnecessary and in many ways unhelpful to local government and I ask the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings to withdraw them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made some positive remarks about the need to encourage local government, but she has not dealt with the issue of Parliament's ability to study the matters more carefully. She says that the House of Lords would not have a local interest, but members of that House, including those of her party, have backgrounds and interests in particular parts of the country; they will therefore take a specific interest if that area has been designated for the penalty. I agree that it is a matter for Parliament and local Government, but it is an exaggeration to say that the measure does local government any favours. From the point of view of designated local authorities, the fuller the debate at all stages of the process, the better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must take issue with some of the Minster's remarks, which rather surprised me. First, the idea that the capping powers are in any way similar to those inherited from the previous Administration is sophistry. Nobody outside the Committee believes that; I do not think that any Labour Member sitting behind her believes it; nor do I think that even she believes it. It behoves her to treat the Committee with respect, instead
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I1010">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 505</span>
of carrying on the pretence that the measure is some sort of relaxation of Government authority over local authority finances.<br><br>
Secondly, the powers in the Bill are far from being overt and fair, which is what our capping powers sought to be. They are secretive, because the principles are not published in advance; they are retrospective, because they apply only after councils have set their budgets; and, they are selective, because different classes of authority can be treated differently, and any matters can be taken into account. There is a real case for holding the Executive to account more effectively than simply allowing Ministers to exercise powers without holding them to account.<br><br>
The Minister introduced the most extraordinary red herring. When we suggested that there should be an affirmative resolution of both Houses, the Minister said that that would break with custom. The capping powers that she inherited from the previous Administration do not provide for an affirmative resolution of both Houses, so the House of Lords has never discussed the matter of capping individual authorities. We can hardly say that that is a custom. There has never been occasion for the House of Lords to discuss such matters. The House of Lords can have authority over how money is spent in the same way as the House of commons, but the other place does not have locus over the money that is raised. Jurisdiction over supply is, by custom, denied to the other place.<br><br>
The measure is not a matter of supply, but about how Government moneys are spent and how much autonomy local authorities have over their own affairs. It is a legitimate matter for the other place to consider.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a minute.<br><br>
Whenever the other place upset the apple cart on local government matters under the previous Conservative Government, I am sure that the hon. Lady was one of the first on her feet to say what a good thing that was and that the House of Lords had more democratic credentials than the House of Commons, with its Conservative majority. That shows the humbug that consumes the Labour party about the House of Lords. The Minister is blinded by her prejudices about the House of Lords, and I am surprised that her civil servants allowed her to make such comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is talking about humbug, why did his Government cap 20 authorities in 1990 without pre-signalling the principles? Why did they cap 14 the following year, without pre-signalling? The House of Lords was given no opportunity to comment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The House of Lords was give no opportunity to comment, and nor was the House of Commons because no affirmative resolution was required.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There was a debate.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 506</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A debate on a matter may have been raised by the Opposition, but there was no requirement for an affirmative resolution. However, we improved the position. The present arrangements require pre-signalling because it was unsatisfactory not to have it. It is the Local Government Association, which is so well represented on the Labour Benches, that wants a system of pre-signalling. It is unhappy with the arrangements. The Minister said that that will be only a matter of time. However, she will be the first to agree that the system will have failed if such powers are used. Throughout this Committee, she has been dreaming of the harmonious relationship between central Government and local government. However, that relationship will not have come about for those authorities on which these powers will be exercised.<br><br>
Those local authorities will have had plenty of time to get their budgets in order. They will know that capping orders are coming, and will judge whether such orders have parliamentary support. They do not need to wait until orders come into force before taking action. The measure gives the Secretary of State an opportunity to pounce on local authorities without warning. He or she may do that without pre-signalling or without apparent rhyme or reason.<br><br>
Debate would not necessarily cause great delay. If the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions was properly organised, it would not be taken by surprise by authorities likely to break the rules.<br><br>
The Minister said that there would be plenty of opportunity to debate the reason for capping at a later date. However that would be after the event. The House of Commons should not pile more powers on the Secretary of State, to be used at his discretion, and without proper accountability.<br><br>
Our amendments concern democracy and accountability, about which the Government know precious little. They think that their focus groups are more important than Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will briefly endorse everything that my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) has said.<br><br>
The Minister said that the vast majority of councils will never come close to capping. Those singled out for capping will feel so isolated that they will expect full and proper debate at every stage of the process, and not merely after the event. They will feel that they deserve that on the grounds of accountability and proper scrutiny.<br><br>
It is nonsense to say that our amendments would give more power to Parliament, rather than local government. The amendments raise the question of whether Parliament should study the matter or whether the Secretary of State should take more power. However, under the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members indicated that they would like a debate on schedule 1. Committee members should therefore be aware that they should not raise the issues that have just been debated.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the First schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The last seven Administrations have been concerned with the management of local government. Underlying philosophies over that period have been similar, irrespective of the mechanisms that have been put in place: that applies to the current Government and the previous Government, in which I served. Both those Governments have in common a tendency to become increasingly anxious about how to create an efficient local administration. The cost of doing so has been a retreat from the concept of local government. Local administration is not the same as local government.<br><br>
The Government mock my party's suggestions that we should consider our policies. They are daft to do that, especially as they had to invent new Labour etiquette to demonstrate the extent to which their policies had changed. The process of parties considering what they represent is part of a mature political debate.<br><br>
Occasionally, we must ask ourselves whether we believe in the institutions of representative democracy. If we do, we must take risks and allow freedoms. There must be a right to get things wrong and be inefficient and, perhaps, occasionally, to be corrupt—but then there must also be an obligation to pay the penalty prescribed by law.<br><br>
9.30 am<br><br>
The previous Government were preoccupied with service provision, the efficient measurement of services and value for money—a phrase which the Minister reproduces constantly, for reasons that we all understand. We were concerned about ensuring the most efficient means of providing services. In a sense it was more important for those means to be efficient than for them to be democratic. Not only did we ask local authorities to externalise services or go in for tendering, but in some cases we even pushed the provision of services down through the democratic layer, so to speak, into the community.<br><br>
The community may be virtuous, but it is not necessarily democratic. A school board is not a democratic body, to all intents and purposes. Most parish councils are not very democratic, in that it is often necessary to scratch around to find people willing to serve on them. The number of contested elections to them must be tiny in comparison to the number of posts. Increasingly, the emphasis was placed on administration. The concept of government tended to disappear. That is taken even further in the Bill. There is no point in the Minister claiming for the Government a new philosophical departure with respect to local government, or a new validation of the concept of local government. That is baloney. All that is offered is a different mechanism to achieve the same end—efficient local administration.<br><br>
The Government have introduced a colossal panoply of compulsory inspections—partly self-inspection, but with the back-up of an array of external inspections which come into play if the self-inspections are not carried out satisfactorily. The Secretary of State is to have the right to give those instructions. Measurement will be against
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 508</span>
national standards. We introduced national standards and the Audit Commission—the present chairman of which is a lady whom I appointed to serve on it. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) that the imposition of national standards is a push towards a concept of administration rather than of government. It tends towards the minimisation of local particularities.<br><br>
What is the reason for the Government's intention to create a uniform electoral system for local government, prescribed from the centre? Why should not local authorities be able to decide whether to elect on a four-yearly, everybody-out cycle, or a third and a third and a third? The reason is of course to reduce the risk of councils with permanent majorities. However, if the electors decide that they want that and are prepared to run the risks that go with it, is it necessarily for us to say that it should not happen? They pays their money, they takes their choice.<br><br>
We are also to have a nationally prescribed code of ethics, and the Government will encourage new forms of administration. The Prime Minister talks of elected mayors. That will make good entertainment, at any rate. Forms of cabinet government will be introduced. Those are further instances of the national Government prescribing what freedom local authorities should enjoy. Earlier, during an interesting debate, the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) and I agreed that local government's authority was handed down to it by national government, not entrusted to it by what we might, without going into definitions, broadly describe as the community.<br><br>
The assumption is that local government must be controlled, monitored, surveyed and checked in all its aspects. It does not matter what rhetoric is used. Any Government are bound to take a view on what happens to 25 per cent, of national expenditure. That was a phrase that I used repeatedly when I was in her position. It is the overriding pretext for this form of top-down control.<br><br>
Schedule 1 is the heart of this part of the Bill. However whether capping powers are described as crude and universal or sophisticated and partial, they remain capping powers. They exist for a particular purpose—to pre-empt the decision of local authorities. The Minister admitted that there could be circumstances in which the national interest as defined by the Government might be deemed superior to a local interest, even if that interest were expressed in a referendum. The local authority of the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) has just carried out a referendum, which resulted in a council tax increase of around 9 per cent. The Bill may create good local administration, but marks another step in the retreat from local government— and we need to reflect on that.<br><br>
I am not making another speech about Europe. I want you to know that, Mr. Gale, because I want to remain in order and do not want you to think that I am pursuing a particular hobby horse, known in French as a violon d'Ingres. I mention that because there is an extremely good Ingres exhibition in London—for my money, better value than the Monet exhibition.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 509</span>
Under the impulse of devolution, the United Kingdom is moving towards a federal structure. The Government are talking about new structures in England, and the problem of what form of governance is appropriate for England will emerge. We may become like Washington D.C.—the only territory run by the federal Government without having its own powers—on a grand scale. So we need to flunk about what we mean by representative democracy and real government.<br><br>
We are moving beyond the stage at which the Minister's proposals can be relevant to the new structures of the United Kingdom. I hope that when the Government ponder the new constitutional structures in Britain, they will think again about how our government is carried out an dhow people can be represented at that level. We must not end up merely with effective administration.<br><br>
I have no doubt that Brussels could administer us effectively. However, many of my colleagues—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The fact that the right hon. Gentleman tells me that he is in order does not mean that he is in order. We must focus our debate on the principles of schedule 1.1 understand that the right hon. Gentleman wishes to put them in context, but I have given him a great deal of leeway and that has now come to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Gale. I was simply pointing out that there is a seamless web in the concept of government and administration. Many people close to me believe that the spider at the heart of that seamless web is Brussels. We have to decide on the principles of government in an age that is experiencing movement upwards to wider structures—the process of globalisation—rand downwards through devolution. It is unclear whether either of those will provide the sort of representative government that people feel provides true accountability.<br><br>
How we achieve a form of government based on accountability that enables us to entrust people to take decisions—including mistakes—is at the heart of the constitutional question to which all sensible people in this House should be devoting their attention. The debate on the schedule is a symptom of it; the wider issue will not go away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a touch of echo between my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon and myself, but the difference is that he is eloquent and I have difficulty with English as a second language.<br><br>
I want to follow a similar theme but rather narrower, which I suspect will relieve you, Mr. Gale. The Minister spoke as if some of the credit for her proposals is due to the actions of previous Conservative Governments. If we go back further, we can understand why those Governments took those actions. There is an oft-quoted statement—it has now become tedious—by the former Labour Minister Crosland about the party being over. That set the scene for a confrontation between the then Labour Government and local government, and for a series of Conservative Governments who tried to bring the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 510</span>
economy of this country into line. Twenty-five per cent, of Government expenditure is local government expenditure, which is probably rising today. That is also reflected in the Minister's frequent statements about looking at national issues.<br><br>
In those early days there was a considerable battle. The Government had to be fairly heavy handed. I was in local government at the time and I watched the increasing leaning—the introduction of SSAs, capping, the Audit Commission and the chasing of errant local authorities and their members. Anyone who lived in Derbyshire, next to Lambeth or in Lambeth itself would have recognised the difficulties and the reasons for them. Targets were brought in which have eased over the last few years, particularly while my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon and I were in the Department of the Environment. I know those individual local authorities and few of them were hit. Those that were recognised why, but there was a progressive easing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Alan Whitehead <span class='memberconstituency'>(Southampton, Test)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman cite any pieces of legislation that eased the matter for local government over the last years of his Administration?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not have to look at legislation, but at the way it was acted upon. The Minister accepted that herself when she talked about the way that we published it. We gave fair warning and respected the fact that local authorities had points to make. They came in to see us. We had deputations about SSA times which, I hasten to point out, have been cut out. We listened to them. There were changes and movements in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Whitehead</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that, although there were no changes in the worst case scenario legislation, there was a substantial change in atmosphere in the relationship between central and local government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman will find it difficult to accept, but there was. There was a considerable movement and it was two way. Local government recognised that it had an important role to play nationally. One could see that in the way in which local authorities set their budgets. Many of them set them at capping, but many did not. Many shifted and changed and were allowed to make mistakes as my right hon. Friend pointed out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Was not an important part of that change in atmosphere reflected in the change in attitude of local government? Those powers were introduced at a time when the hard left in places like Liverpool and Lambeth used local government as a platform to challenge the basis of democracy. The Greater London council used to talk about the superior mandate, for example. Those powers were brought into try to stop local authorities thwarting overall Government economic policy. Now that the Labour party has changed, as everyone acknowledges, and there are far fewer such local Labour party politicians—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. First, this is not relevant to the schedule and, secondly, it is an intervention.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I1013">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 511</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend got the gist of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I did. Many of the Labour Back Benchers will recognise that. Some of them struggled with neighbouring authorities. The hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) must have had considerable difficulties with her neighbour, a fact that benefited me and my local authority as it demonstrated how idiotic local government could be. But generally it was not. We are now dealing with the exact opposite. There has been a complete step backwards. We have seen that in the manipulation of the SSA, the moving of funds north and the games that are being played there.<br><br>
The schedule is the heaviest machine gun loading on local government that I have seen. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon said, whatever one calls it, it is capping of a particularly vicious form. The paper entitled "The Reserve Powers" presented at the previous sitting sets that out and proves my point, that there are four different versions, one of which is the current sole option.<br><br>
9.45 am<br><br>
The Minister keeps saying that we should have faith. The faith of Labour Back Benchers will be reinforced by the party's machinery, but local government is writhing. It does not like the fact that the schedule will enable the Secretary of State to cap any authority's budget in the current financial year and in the next one, and to set a target for reducing that local authority's budget over several financial years.<br><br>
It is an understatement to say that the Secretary of State will have considerable discretion over the selection of authorities. He will be able to pick and choose because schedule 1 will enable him to select an individual council for whatever reason he wishes. I do not expect that to happen—it had better not happen, because there will be an uproar—but he will have the ability to do so.<br><br>
The Minister tells us that everything will be all right and that we should have faith, but that is not good enough and local government knows it. In my 20 years in local government I have never seen it placed in such a position. To use a topical metaphor, the proposal is a potential avalanche: if the weather on either side of the relationship changes slightly, it will be extremely destructive to local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to discuss the proposal in the context of its politics, especially those of the Labour party. The schedule reeks of the hypocrisy of new Labour. In Opposition, the party pledged to do away with "crude and universal" capping; most people probably understood that to mean that they would get rid of capping, not just crude and universal capping. Those who heard the resolution before the Labour party conference in, I think, 1994, thought that crude and universal were words that applied to capping itself and that the Labour party would get rid of it, because it was crude and universal. They did not realise that the words crude and universal were merely a qualification and that the sub-text of the conference resolution was, "and we're going to implement a different kind of capping".</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 512</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian White <span class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The manifesto stated clearly that reserve powers would be retained. It was spelt out in black and white.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it had been in the resolution—[<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East says that it was in the resolution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are debating schedule 1, not the Labour party manifesto, or Second Reading.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Gale. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I appreciate that the Government Whip may not like this part of the debate, but the schedule is a betrayal. If the hon. Lady is pretending that the Labour party did not try to create the impression in Opposition that it was against the principle of capping, she is living in cloud cuckoo land, or deliberately misleading herself.<br><br>
The proposal implements a new kind of capping and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley said, it implements several different types. I draw on the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon to explain why we are opposed to the schedule. Now that local government is not challenging the government's authority to set economic parameters, it is not seen as a bastion of Marxist revolution, as it was in isolated pockets—[<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East chuckles. Does he remember what happened in Liverpool? Is he proud of his party's record in that city? Of course not. One of the bravest things that a leader of the Labour party did in recent years was to take on the left of his party in places such as Liverpool, with the result that local authorities now behave more responsibly. The time has come for all of us to—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Government Members are muttering away because they do not like what I am saying. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is for the Chair to decide what is relevant. I am making sure that the hon. Gentleman is in order. He is speaking to schedule 1; if he ceases to do so I will call him to order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Labour Members do not like it when their party is laid bare before their eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to thank the hon. Gentleman recognising that the changes have nothing to do with the previous Administration and everything to do with how the Labour party understands local government and works with it. An overwhelming number of local councils in the north, south, east and west are Labour controlled. The Conservative party cannot match that because it is seen as anti-local government and irrelevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is glossing over quite a lot and putting words into my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister said is astonishing. She should remember the behaviour of Derbyshire, whose leader was checked only by the powers

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 513</span>
of the previous Administration, not by the Labour party. They were not the draconian powers that we see in this Bill; there was a progressive easing in the last few years of the Conservative Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is inevitable in a party political system that there will be differences between the parties and inevitable that those differences will intrude upon debates from time to time. The hon. Gentleman made his point and I have allowed the Minister to reply to him and to make her point. May we now please return to the schedule? If we do not, I shall rule the hon. Gentleman out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gale.<br><br>
The capping powers in the schedule are part of a career structure that the new Labour party has constructed for its councillors in local government. The career structure in the Labour party is about discipline; it is about not causing any embarrassment. What the Labour party wants in order to maintain a presentable facade to the British public is to be able to discipline its own members because no Conservative authorities will be capped. Conservative councils generally have much lower council tax; it is the Labour authorities that cause the problem. It is ironic that when the Conservative party was on the ramparts trying to control the worst local authorities the Labour party was nowhere to be seen. The Labour party started tackling the issue when it realised that it had to control its own councillors and local authorities to make the Labour party an electable force. Labour Ministers want the proposed powers to control Labour local authorities so that their potential candidates can claim expenses and so on in local government without embarrassing the party at Westminster.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Sally Keeble <span class='memberconstituency'>(Northampton, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that his party has a long record of disciplining local councillors? In the 1930s, thousands of Labour councillors were surcharged for providing school meals. The reason the reserve powers are just that is that the debate about local government has shifted on. Those powers are required as reserve powers, but, generally, capping is not required because the debate has moved on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would love to believe that it had. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley said, we felt that it had, but, as he also reminded us, the existing powers are effectively maintained in the Bill, although with less control. There is less discipline on the Secretary of State, and no obligation on him to notify local authorities. The Secretary of State has taken additional powers to
<br><blockquote><p>"designate the authority for the following year",</p></blockquote>
to
<br><blockquote><p>"set a notional budget requirement to be used for the purposes of comparisons instead of the actual budget"</p></blockquote>
and to
<br><blockquote><p>"designate the authority over a number of years".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Lady may think that the Secretary of State taking extra capping powers is moving on. We think that the schedule is going down the wrong road. There may
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 514</span>
be all sorts of party political reasons why the Labour party wants to be particularly tough on its own councillors: after all, it has a track record of its own councillors being an embarrassment to the party.<br><br>
The Conservative party is eager to try to rekindle the sort of civic pride and local autonomy that local authorities enjoyed in the 19th century. It has become unfashionable to talk of Victorian values because of the association with Thatcherism. In fact the 19th century model of local authority autonomy is the sort of vision that we need for local authorities, but it is miles away from the provisions in the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the concept of hostels for unmarried mothers might well be a Victorian concept—one which the Home Secretary appears to have rediscovered?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am looking at the frown on Mr. Gale's face. I understand what my right hon. Friend says.<br><br>
If we agree that we should rekindle local autonomy to enable local authorities to lead their communities instead of just being agencies of central Government under supervision from the Audit Commission and umpteen supervisory powers and ultimately having their budget supervised from Westminster as well—if local government is to mean something and we are to attract the right type of people to it instead of career politicians passing through on their way to Westminster—we need to pause for thought before giving the Secretary of State all these new powers.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), the leader of our party, has made it clear that we want to move autonomy and local decision making down to local authorities because we think that local people should have more control over their affairs. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley said, we attempted to do that in the closing stages of the previous Government. The schedule is a major step in the wrong direction. Labour Members, who shake their heads sadly, know that. They know that the provision is a betrayal. They know the stance taken by the Local Government Association, which says that
<br><blockquote><p>"The Association remains firmly opposed to the capping of local authority budgets."</p></blockquote>
They know that the LGA hoped that they would not continue capping and that it is deeply disappointed that their Government are doing so. They know too that the LGA want the key principles governing capping written into the Bill and that that betrayal has also come to pass. This is a Government who were elected on aspirations and promises that they never had any intention of delivering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This part of the Bill is central to the debate about the nature of local government that some of my hon. Friends have just touched upon. Of course there is a tension between national Government and local government; there always has been. It has always been a dynamic relationship, the parameters of which, have shifted. This part of the Bill is the mechanism, or tool, with which all Governments have chosen to control local government. However, it is time to concede, and to move on.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I1015">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 515</span>
I acknowledge that over the past several years, a combination of capping and standard spending assessments has forced authorities into the margin as regards their inability to spend on services that they considered appropriate to their community. We forced that margin ever tighter, so that authorities had less room to innovate. In this respect, the Bill could have been an opportunity to move on from that process, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex said, was necessary, given the background that was inherited. It could have provided for the evolution of thinking by both local government and national Government—for a foundation from which to move on, rather than a tightening of the screw.<br><br>
10 am<br><br>
The detail of schedule 1—lest anyone is unclear about it—reveals a tightening of capping. The suggestion that universal capping has gone is merely a soundbite. In practice, the schedule will allow local authorities to be picked off—identified and targeted—by the political will of the Secretary of State of the day. It would not necessarily be a Labour Secretary of State for all time: these measures will be used by any politician at the centre who has no feel or passion for local democracy. The Secretary of State may take powers to nominate or designate a local authority if he or she deems the budgetary requirement for the year under consideration excessive or to set a notional amount for that authority, and to do so without reference to both Houses of Parliament. It is true that these powers will be taken after some discussion, but there will be no real opportunity for a local authority or Parliament to have a key say in the process, nor a commitment that the criteria will be published in advance. The extraordinary part is the secrecy, as my right hon. Friend the Member for North Essex said. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Sorry, I mean my hon. Friend I was anticipating.<br><br>
Both my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon and my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley, who, in their time as Ministers were responsible for the capping regime, made brave speeches stating that they would have looked for an evolution or development of capping. Both spoke of how attitudes had changed and moved on both in Government and local government. That opportunity has been missed, and targeted local authorities will resent that bitterly. While the provision may succeed—this has to be acknowledged—in limiting the risk of another Lambeth or Liverpool, it will also limit the ability of local authorities to innovate. It will penalise excellence and stop authorities differentiating themselves for good, as well as for ill. I do not want uniform, mediocre local government; I want a flowering of diversity in which different local authorities do different things that are relevant to their communities, and, in the end, are judged by their communities. The people, not the Government or the Secretary of state, are the ultimate arbiters in this process. The Government will, through the schedule, deliver a uniformity. They will say what local government does, when, at what cost, and who is to carry out the task. They will than audit, and, if they do not like what has been done, they will punish authorities. That is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 516</span>
what the schedule is about. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley rightly said, that represents an unprecedented attack on local democracy.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon said that, previously, Government had focused on service delivery. The previous Government focused on the process of service delivery rather than on defining what they wanted to go in or come out and then telling people that if they did not conform to those norms they would be penalised. That was a very different agenda. We cannot have the freedom to excel unless we have also the freedom to fail.<br><br>
It is a plain truth of local democracy that if people elect a local authority that fails, the authority is ultimately answerable to the people. We do not deny that the Government have a financial responsibility with their overall control of the public purse. That is why I said that it is a dynamic relationship. There is an inevitable tension between that legitimate concern and the ability of local government to have the opportunity to differentiate itself, but the Bill goes further than pervious legislation, and schedule 1 is the instrument and tool of central control.<br><br>
I talked about a flowering of diversity. That must be anathema to the Minister. She does not want diverse local government. The Government do not want plural local government; they want it to be uniform, dull, mediocre, controlled and restricted. Local people should understand that once that happens, once it has become law, the opportunity to change it will be minimal.<br><br>
Throughout our debates, I have argued a strong case of local democracy—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I have argued a strong case for local democracy; it is on record. I must tell those hon.. Members who find it amusing that when their constituents—and probably their councillors and local authorities—read the record, they will be bitterly disappointed that their Member of Parliament did not raise as much as a small flag.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not it say something about the new Labour party that when anyone mentions local democracy it raises a guffaw of laughter? The sad thing is that Labour Members do not realise the irony of their situation, as they press ahead with a schedule such as this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say that they have not raised even a small flag for local government, let alone waved a big banner. That will be seen in the public record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Keeble</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has raised a little flag. I shall now let her raise another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Keeble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As someone who worked for an extremely popular authority that was scrapped by the Conservative Government—it was just across the river—I think that the hon. Gentleman should recognise that the Government are giving extra powers to local government, creating extra levels of local bureaucracy and empowering local people in a way that the previous Government would never have dreamed of?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I claim neither the charm nor the incisiveness of the hon. Lady, but I have read the Bill thoroughly and I have found no evidence that it gives local government more power. I do not deny that it could oblige local authorities to think more clearly about how they deliver their services and that it will oblige them to undertake some self-analysis and scrutiny, but it does so in a vanilla-flavoured way. that is not untypical of Governments since the war, because Administrations of both parties have used similar mechanisms. It is an on-going process; local government has increasingly come under the thumb of central Government, but the Bill takes this still further. The false gods are equity and comparability.<br><br>
The idea that we need to compare all local authorities to common standards and criteria is highly questionable. It has not been questioned by Labour Members, but its usefulness to me in South Holland and The Deepings—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Whitehead</span><span class='membercontribution'>:<i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give way, but I want to stick tightly to the schedule, Mr. Gale, as your implored us to do. I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman provided he sticks to the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Whitehead</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman can enlighten the Committee. When did he start questioning that "highly questionable" proposition? How recently did he start questioning the idea that all councils should be comparable? Was it last week perhaps?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I put that intervention down to enthusiastic naivety. I was a local councillor from the age of 27. I have never changed my perspective on local government. I studied politics at university and specialised in local government. Throughout my 25-year political career I have taken the view that local government is a fundamentally important part of our democratic infrastructure, that local people should be able to make local choices that are appropriate for local communities— and I have made numerous speeches, in numerous forums, to that effect. So I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has given me the opportunity of regaling the Committee with that breadth of experience. That will look very good on the record—or rather it will not, because the record cannot convey irony and self-deprecation. When, the following day one reads comments that were made in that spirit, they always seem flat and plain.<br><br>
I have looked at the debates on local government that took place in the previous Parliament and which dealt with matters similar to those we are debating now. I found that, on more than 20 occasions, Labour Members attacked capping purely on the grounds that it was anti-democratic and unfavourable to local choice and discretion. I had not realised how far the Labour party had travelled in terms of antipathy towards local choice and local diversity. There can be no choice unless local choice and local diversity. There can be no choice unless local authorities and parties within them are able to differentiate themselves, yet the schedule does not allow for that. That message needs to ring out from the Committee to the whole country.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 518</span>
The Minister says that her party controls councils up and down Britain, from south to north and east to west. She would be wise to be more cautious about that statement before the coming local government elections; I would not be surprised if her party lost up to 500 seats in those elections. <i>[Interruption.]</i> My local authority already has only a handful of Labour members; it will have even fewer after the elections.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Until now the hon. Gentleman has commendably remained in order, in a way that some other hon. Members have not; I would be disappointed if he blemished his record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Blemishing my record with you, Mr. Gale, would be one of the worst things that I could do.<br><br>
I think that I have made my points clearly and firmly; I hope that I have made them honestly and in a non-partisan way. Much of what I have said could be said by people from all political parties or none.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to follow the born-again devolution from the Conservative Benches, but I will try because I think that the Liberal Democrats have a worthwhile contribution to make on the schedule and on local government in general. Traditionally, there has been two-way suspicion between central and local government because of the difficult constitutional relationship. It was ever thus and probably always will be. Much of that suspicion focuses on the financial relationship and the belief that decisions, whether on grants or the power to cap local authority budgets, are made in a partisan way.<br><br>
I agreed with everything that the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon said in his analysis of the relationship between different levels of government. I found it uncomfortable to be agreeing with Conservative Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: New politics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not new politics, it is because the words were—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already made it plain that I do not appreciate sedentary interventions, if only because it is a gross discourtesy to the <i>Hansard</i> reporters, who find it difficult to record such remarks accurately.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I found it difficult to agree with Conservative Members because while the words that they used were ones with which all members of the Committee would probably agree, I was a councillor for eight years under the Tory Government and witnessed their systematic undermining of local democracy. You would rule me out of order, Mr. Gale, if I listed the litany of sins that they committed and which they seem to be recanting, but the key point is that the control that was exercised during 18 years of Conservative Government did not work; it blurred accountability.<br><br>
10.15 am<br><br>
The less freedom local authorities had to set their own budgets and determine their own priorities, the easier it was for local government to blame central Government.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I1017">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 519</span>
Therefore, people who voted in local elections did not know what they were voting for. They did not know whether they were voting for a council that would deliver better services at reasonable cost; whether they were voting for a council that would cut services; or whether central Government were forcing those cuts on the council.<br><br>
All of us who have campaigned in local elections have thrived because of that blurred accountability. As a result, an increasing number of people either voted Labour or Liberal Democrat during those 18 years. At their nadir, the Conservatives ran 13 councils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady acknowledge that it became harder to attract people to serve in local government because they thought that they would only be going through the motions? If local government simply becomes an agency of central Government, exciting, innovative, dynamic people will never take part because they will simply be expected to carry out the Secretary of State's whims.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. It has become harder to attract people to stand in local government elections. In Somerset, the Conservatives are advertising for candidates in the local press. <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I appreciate that hon. Members have been provoked to some extent this morning. That is the stuff of politics. We cannot have private conversations in Committee. If the Under-Secretary and the Government Whip wish to have a discussion, will they please do so outside. I, if no one else, want to hear the hon. Lady.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gale. I am glad that someone wants to listen to me.<br><br>
The previous Government's policies have meant that turnout at local elections has decreased. The Government have spoken abut that in another White Paper. Those of us who knock on doors know that people often say, "What is the point of voting? You can't change the colour of the council around here", because people always vote for a certain party; or they say, "The council has little power, so what is the point of voting for it? Everything is done by the Government."<br><br>
I must not stray too far in talking about the Conservative's record, but it is difficult to resist that temptation because of what Conservative Members have said. We can judge them only by their actions. What they have said this morning will be on record, so we shall hold them to their promises, if they are ever in government again.<br><br>
The control of finance and the matters dealt with in schedule 1 are at the heart of the debate. When we mention capping, Minister repeatedly refer to what the Labour party manifesto said about retaining reserve powers. They say that Labour Members stood on that manifesto. Opposition Members did not, of course, stand on that manifesto, so we are entitled to criticise it—not everyone voted for it.<br><br>
If die Government were to renege on their manifesto promise, no one would march in me streets or make an outcry. In fact, local authorities would give three cheers
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 520</span>
and the Local Government Association would be happy, as would most members of the Labour party. They can afford to renege on that manifesto commitment without losing too much face.<br><br>
As I have said before, the Liberal Democrats are fundamentally opposed to capping. However, the Government are determined to replace universal, crude capping with what they call sophisticated, targeted capping. Therefore, it is even more important that they put before Parliament the criteria that they use. I am sorry that they would not accept the amendments that we debated earlier.<br><br>
The Government say that they want a partnership with local government, yet the Local Government Association—now Labour controlled—is also fundamentally opposed to capping. If capping must continue in any form, the association wants to have checks and balances on the approach adopted by the Secretary of State. Labour Members think that a Labour Secretary of State will always be benign, but there might not always be a Labour Secretary of State. We are not legislating for the next two or three years only, but for the foreseeable future. A Secretary of State of a different political persuasion may take another attitude to local government.<br><br>
We have not talked about the new power to nominate councils—a measure that was not mentioned in the White Paper. I hope that the Minister will explain why that provision is in the schedule. In a previous sitting, she referred to local authorities making budget decisions on the basis of what they thought central Government would allow, or what the capping level was, rather than on how they perceived the needs of local people or local priorities. Nomination and designation powers, and the continuation of capping, will carry on that process of local authorities trying to second guess where the Government are coming from, which will further weaken local accountability. It will not help to attract more good people to stand for local councils, nor will it increase the turnout at local elections. I hope that whatever is in the Government's manifesto, they will have second thoughts about this proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. The record will show the differing contributions that there have been—and the different contributions from the official Opposition. It is always difficult making U-turns and finding a consistent line, but I am sure that if the hon. Member for North Essex works hard at it, he will eventually get mere.<br><br>
The contradictions in his speech this morning were staggering. He says mat he is interested in going back to the Victorian era, and we got to the heart of that. When talking about democracy, he finds it difficult to include a whole group of people who never had to be considered at that time. I am referring, of course, to women, who neither had the vote, nor could they be representatives. The contributions this morning demonstrate that Conservative Members still find it enormously difficult to come to terms with full and open democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 521</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gale. The hon. Lady has just implied that I am in favour of taking away women's votes. She is misleading the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for North Essex is clearly feeling very sensitive. I understand the mental strain that he is experiencing in trying to explain what he voted for and supported in the previous Administration.<br><br>
The speech of the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon was interesting. I covered much of the ground in speaking to amendments last week. I put those powers in the context that the Government have set for the modernisation of local government. I do not intend to go over the arguments again, but it is true that local government is not in the healthy state that we would wish. Simply by looking at the level of turnout in local elections tells us that we cannot afford to be complacent. That is one of the reasons why we need modernisation of local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady illustrates the dilemma. She is saying that local government must be modernised, but that national Government must do it. However, there is an alternative thesis. Perhaps national Government should take their hands off local government and let it evolve. That would be the prescriptive approach; it would represent a continuity between the two regimes, on which we must both reflect. It is not intention that matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. I hope that he will reflect on what I said last week and am trying to say now. We must encourage and give incentive for innovation, good practice and good governance, while ensuring that procedures exist to deal with the one or two local authorities that may try to spoil it for all the others and bring local government back into disrepute. That is what we are trying to do with the schedule and why we refer to reserve powers. The hon. Member for Mole Valley has a rather chequered memory of history, which I shall not explore. We must learn the lessons of history. A few authorities had the opportunity to bring the rest of local government into disrepute. The measures that the previous Government took, designed to clobber those few, clobbered everyone, to speak colloquially, which I usually try to avoid. We have therefore shifted the regime. Capping must be put in the context of those other determinations. The Liberal Democrats have always opposed any controls of any nature. In the current circumstances, that might lead us back to difficulties that neither I nor the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) want local government to experience again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that what she is saying can be considered conversely? Under the previous Administration, SSAs and capping applied to a class of authorities. Application was not subjective. One of the difficulties with the schedule relates not necessarily so much to its application to individual authorities, but to the fact that other individual authorities in the same class as one that is subjected to capping will not be. The opportunity for pork barrel politics definitely exists.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 522</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman enters dangerous territory, where I do not want to go. Even working with classes, the existing system could be manipulated. We made those accusations before the election; we know that that capability exists. The system has become so complex that it is difficult for people outside to understand what is going on and how decisions are reached. The schedule deals with categories—precepting authorities as well as billing authorities. Included in those new precepting authorities will be new local government units such as the Greater London authority which cannot be in a class with any other, because it is different. However, we want to have the opportunity of giving incentives to authorities to become good performing authorities and be taken entirely out of the reach of those reserve powers. The categories may, therefore, cross classes, and may not include all unitary or district authorities, but may include authorities that have clearly demonstrated that they have overwhelming support from their local public, and whose local public feel that, in developing performance indicators, they have a unique relationship with their local authority, which they want to support and be seen to support. I realise that we play political games, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands that I have a vision not of uniformity but of great diversity in local government, which I shall work as hard as possible to achieve. The hon. Gentleman may not agree with our methods, but I hope that he accepts that we are genuinely trying to achieve that aim.<br><br>
We want to provide incentives, we do not want to treat every authority as if it is potentially the most horrendous challenger to central Government and local council tax payers. The current system does that.<br><br>
The process will not be secretive. A designated or nominated local authority will be informed about the principles that have been used, the category to which those principles apply and the category to which the local authority belongs. That will be clear when Parliament debates the matter. I shall explain the way in which the reserve powers will operate.<br><br>
10.30 am<br><br>
The Secretary of State will first have to decide whether the budget requirement is excessive. He will be able to determine the set of principles that he will use to decide whether the budget requirement set by a local authority is excessive. The set of principles must contain a comparison with the budget requirement of a previous year. He may also determine categories of authorities and use a different set of principles for each category.<br><br>
In our previous sitting, I said that councils that make representations about capping and their SSAs do not understand why it is not possible to consider the previous year. The law provides mat that is not possible, but no one in local government can understand or explain that. Local government representatives have stressed that to us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What difference would being able to consider the previous year make to, for example, Derbyshire, which was capped? Which authorities would be capped if the measure was already at the Minister's disposal?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I1019">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 523</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gave examples in our previous sitting of matters that would be examined. I am not prepared to name local authorities in Committee in a way that makes them feel that I am being vindictive. We are trying to establish more rational ways in which to work with local authorities, so that they understand our perception of the national interest, and what we mean when we say that they do not listen to local people, for example, in the year after an election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to deal with the intervention of the hon. Member for North Essex.<br><br>
It is not fair for a Minister to name authorities that may be affected by the schedule. I have no idea of the identity of those authorities. I do not have a target list. The hon. Member for Mole Valley continually suggests that we have such a list. I wonder how he acted when he was in government if he believes that we have a list. We do not keep a list of goodies and a list of baddies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister says. However, Labour Members constantly imply that we had a target list when we were in government. That is not practical. I did not keep a list; she does not keep a list; no one can do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly accept that the right hon. Gentleman did not keep a list, and I know that I do not, but I do not accept that that was the case throughout the previous Administration. History has still to be written about that.<br><br>
If the Secretary of State decides that the budget requirement is excessive, he will be able to designate the authority for the year under consideration or for the following year. Where an authority is designated for a year, the Secretary of State will inform it of a target budget requirement and a maximum amount for that year. In some cases the target and maximum will be the same because the Secretary of State will consider the local authority capable of reducing its budget requirement to target in a single year. However, if they are different, the intention will be to designate the authority over several years until the target is reached. The Secretary of State will state how many years he thinks it may take to reach the target. That figure will be updated as necessary—for example in the light of inflation.<br><br>
Opposition Members rail about how dreadful the power is. Its purpose is to enable authorities to work towards control of their budgets. Conservative Members have not yet quite understood what we mean by three-year budgeting. The hon. Member for Mole Valley accused us of not receiving delegations, but that is not right. We have said that we want stability in the allocation of SSAs over three years. We shall of course meet representatives of local government as necessary in that time, during which we shall also conduct the reviews of SSAs and of whether a different method can be found of allocating and redistributing central Government grant and the uniform business rate. However, there will be no need for councils to make representations annually about SSAs, as they have done. They will know that those SSAs will not be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 524</span>
changed for three years. Dialogue will, emphatically, take place. In fact, I have a meeting this afternoon with the Local Government Association, within the partnership, and regular meetings take place for discussion.<br><br>
Local government will have the power to manage budgets more effectively in the relevant period. Both the private and public sectors consider the present opportunity to be very important. They want local government to grasp it. It has been overwhelmingly welcomed by local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister understand that what she has been talking about is a further emasculation of local government? As she knows, it works on the basis of an annual budgeting process and discussion of its priorities. Of course, it may have a long-term view, but by extending capping over time the Minister will further damage a local authority's opportunities to come to terms regularly with its local priorities, to articulate them to her and to obtain funds from Government to deal with them. She has outlined a further extension of Government power over local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must simply disagree with the hon. Gentleman. I do not know of any kind of business or public organisation that does not feel that now, at the beginning of the 21st century, proper budget control and management over a period is better than responding annually as councils must now. The current situation is deeply unsatisfactory and the reserve powers have been developed as a result of the representations that have been made.<br><br>
An authority may be nominated by the Secretary of State, instead of being designated. The hon. Member for Taunton raised that point. In that case, the Secretary of State may set a notional budget requirement for the year under consideration. That requirement will be taken into account, instead of the actual budget requirement, if that year is used to make a comparison when considering whether future budget requirements excessive.<br><br>
That is a yellow card, warning the council that the Government disagree with it. The council is warned that its budget requirement is becoming excessive and that it is reaching the point at which it may be designated in future. The Government will be telling the council: "This year, your budget should have been set at this level; you have set it too high".<br><br>
Such advice should be taken into consideration. Of course, the council will have an opportunity to make representations and argue that particular events, not considered by the Government, should be taken into account. When we designate the following year, we will have to take into account the previous year's budget. That was what I was saying when the hon. Lady had to leave the Committee.<br><br>
Such consideration is partly needed to get over some of the problems that every authority experiences. Indeed, your authority experienced such problems when you were part of the delegation in the first year in which we implemented capping outlined by the previous Administration. When your authority came—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not my authority.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I1020">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 525</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Lady's authority came to me, it argued that we had to take into account reductions in budgets over the years. My response was that we were not legally allowed to do that. In future, we will have to take into account the previous year's budget when we designate. That is why we will set a notional budget, which will be part of the following year's consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Last week, the hon. Lady said that she objected to the process under the Conservative regime, whereby councils deliberately set a budget at cap and did not have a real debate about budget setting. They simply went with what they knew the Government would allow.<br><br>
Does she accept that that process is the same as nominating and telling an authority that its budget should have been set at a certain level, which should be taken into account the following year?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From the outset, I have said that having to use powers shows that a local council will have failed to take control of its budget and take responsibility for it in ways that recognise its own course of action and the needs of local taxpayers. The hon. Lady disagrees with that position. None the less, it is logical.<br><br>
The hon. Lady was anxious that nomination was not included in the White Paper, "Modern Local Government: In Touch with the People". However, that document states that reserve powers could be used to require councils
<br><blockquote><p>"to reduce their budgets over a number of years".</p></blockquote>
We must find technical means for doing that. Nomination enables us to do that without bringing authorities into the designated category, which is the next tier up. We need three different kinds of card: red cards at the top, followed by yellow and purple cards.<br><br>
Nomination is the statutory point at which to designate in a future year or years. I accept that the hon. Lady does not like that. However, I do not agree with Conservative Members who implied that such powers are more punitive than their exercise of the existing measure. That measure has little validity left. It does not allow genuine debate between central and local government when decisions are made. That is not in anyone's interest.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
The procedures for designation are nevertheless similar to those in current legislation. Powers are held in reserve but our determination to push on with the rest of local government modernisation should ensure that it is unnecessary to use them. We want improved performance and governance from local government. However, we are determined to ensure that the vast majority of councils that are getting on with the job do not get caught up in legislation that is a simple, single club but might end up damaging the whole of local government. We want to be able to discriminate between councils that are meeting the needs of local people and councils that are ignoring them and bringing the whole of local government into disrepute.<br><br>

<p>Government amendment No. 238.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 24 provides that the Secretary of State—or the National Assembly for Wales—may determine whether the budget requirement of a major precepting authority is excessive, and that he should inform the authority of his opinion during the financial year. We accept that it would be preferable for local authorities if the Secretary of State were able to inform major precepting authorities of the criteria used to decide whether an amount were excessive before the start of the relevant year.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 235 and 236 allow the Secretary of State to announce that a budget requirement that exceeds a specified guideline is excessive, and lay the regulations requiring the payments to billing authorities, before the financial year begins. In practice, we would aim, as this year, to announce the provisional guideline with the provisional settlement and to lay the regulations at the time of the announcement of the settlement. Amendments Nos. 237 and 238 provide for the first year of the scheme.

For 1999–2000, the Secretary of State can base his opinion that the budget requirement is excessive on the guidance already issued.<br><br>
Turning to the amendments from the Hon. Members opposite, amendment No. 201 would restrict the Secretary of State to a set of principles that is the same for all authorities in deciding whether the budget requirement is excessive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gale. The clause and its amendments relate to regulations that are laid elsewhere in this place. May I ask the Minister, through you, Mr. Gale, to explain the purpose of the regulations? Without a proper explanation, our discussions will be Kafkaesque and meaningless.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for the Chair. It is up to the Minister to decide how best to present her arguments. She has heard what the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon says and will respond if she so wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to explain the purpose of the clause and why other aspects are left to regulations. The clause is simply a means to enable precepting authorities that set their council tax at a level that means that they have to contribute to council tax benefit to transfer that liability to the billing authority. The law does not allow that at present.<br><br>
The council tax benefit subsidy limitation scheme announced in the settlement debate will be the subject of a Delegated Legislation Committee later this month, so I am cautious about going too far into that. The principle of the scheme is that, where local decisions lead to large council tax increases, and thus council tax benefit, some or all of the costs of the extra council tax benefit should be met locally rather than nationally. We believe that that will make councils take more responsibility for decisions about council tax.<br><br>
The guideline is a 4.5 per cent, increase in council tax which, as the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon correctly points out, is part of the regulations, or such higher increase as is necessary to give the council an increase in its budget requirements equal to its cash SSA increase. It is the same for all billing and major precepting authorities. In other words, the criteria that we have announced this year are the same for all authorities.<br><br>
Councils budgeting prudently and setting council taxes up to the guidance level will continue to receive subsidy as now. Individuals' benefit of entitlement will not therefore be changed. But the fact that the national taxpayer currently picks up the full results of council tax increases through council tax benefit subsidy should be shared at local level if that goes above a particular level. I hope that does not mean that I am out of order. I simply seek to inform hon. Members about the precise context of the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are the details of this scheme identical in England, Wales and Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. We are entering into devolution and the Welsh Assembly will play a significant role in implementing aspects of the Bill. Because of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 528</span>
differences in the local government finance systems in Wales, and more especially in Scotland, the schemes will be different.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it true, therefore, that in Wales and Scotland the amount clawed back from councils, in the event of what the Government regard as an excessive interest, will be less than the amount clawed back from English councils in identical circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult for me to give a straight answer on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced that that is so because the systems are so very different and will operate in different ways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Perhaps the Minister could be informed on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say that if I am wrong I will come back to the Committee. I do not have responsibility for Scotland and Wales. My responsibility is to put to the Committee what we are doing in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it turns out that my right hon. Friend is correct, what will be the hon. Lady's reaction?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have made it clear that my responsibility is for England. I am content that the scheme that we have proposed for England is fair and right for our structure.<br><br>
Amendment No. 201 argues that the principles should be the same for all authorities when deciding whether the budget requirement is excessive. I understand where Opposition Members are coming from, but at some stage we may want to have a different scheme for a precepting authority than for a billing authority. In normal circumstances that might not be true, but if something happened in the fire service one year, we might want to exempt fire authorities. Therefore, I resist the amendment, so that if that proved necessary we could use the affirmative resolution.<br><br>
This year we have used the same set of principles for all authorities and we currently intend that that should continue. In their responses to the consultation on this year's scheme, some authorities have said that the scheme should differentiate between types of authorities or that certain exclusions, that would affect a particular type of authority, should operate. We therefore felt that we should at least leave open that possibility and not state in the Bill that every authority should always be treated in the same way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is another possible approach. The hon. Lady used the fire authorities as an example. They would be called a class or category and could be treated differently through their SSA and their revenue support grant. That would offset the difficulty that she describes.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I1022">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 529</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They could be, but that is precisely the point that I am trying to make. I do not foresee many circumstances when it would be appropriate, but local authorities have put the point to us, and we have, therefore, responded by resisting the amendment.
I understand where hon. Members are coming from but I am not persuaded that we should not at least retain the option. I hope that, on reflection, hon. Members will agree not to press the amendment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 100 would require the Secretary of State to publish all the factors that he takes into account when setting criteria to determine if the budget requirement is excessive. The criteria themselves will be published, as they have been this year, as part of the settlement and the Secretary of State will defend them as necessary. The criteria will be based on the Secretary of State's views of what is reasonable to be borne by local taxpayers, which is a matter of judgement. I hope that the Hon. Members will be reassured and will not press the amendment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 39 does not make sense. As the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon said, the requirement for authorities to raise the tax for the scheme has been given effect by regulations made under the Local Government Finance Act 1992. Thus, provision is already made for it to apply to the next financial year.<br><br>
Clause 24 merely provides a technical fix to ensure that the burden can be spread fairly between the local authorities responsible. Preventing the clause from having effect for 1999-2000 would not reverse the scheme; it would simply produce a shortfall on the collection fund for the first financial year of the scheme—a shortfall that would have to be met by the major precepting authority that had exceeded the guideline, as well as the billing authorities, which may not have done so.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister says raises a significant matter. If clause 24 is not carried into law, the hon. Lady will, of course, carry on as though the other regulations will still be carried into law. However, if clause 24 is not carried into law, she will have to withdraw the three regulations on the council tax benefit limitation scheme, which are currently before the House, because the scheme could not possibly operate without the clause being in place. Will the hon. Lady confirm that, if the Government were to lose this part of the Bill, she would withdraw the other regulations? If she does not, she will be imposing a completely perverse situation on local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that we are acting and following the usual procedures of the House. We have every right to take the regulations forward, and they will stand. They have to be debated in Committee, but, none the less, they came into effect the day after they were laid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that is not the question that my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex asked. We do not dispute that the Government can lay regulations. My hon. Friend said that, if the clause were to be removed from the Bill, the Government could not implement their regulations, because they would not have a mechanism
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 530</span>
to redistribute resources between local authorities; that is because precepting and billing authorities are not the same. In practice, therefore, the Government would have no alternative but to withdraw their regulations. It would not work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced of that, but time will tell.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I have made the position absolutely clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise another point about the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would delay the scheme for a year. If it were carried, it would be perfectly reasonable for the hon. Lady to delay her whole scheme for a year. It would be utterly perverse if she were them to exercise powers under those regulations that could clobber unfairly the authority that was not overspending and put the burden on the authority that was trying to pay the council tax benefit. Is she seriously suggesting that that is what she would do?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not notice the hon. Gentleman raising a new point.<br><br>
Amendment No. 99 proposes that the Secretary of State should agree with the Local Government Association the factors to be used in deciding whether the budget requirement is excessive. As hon. Members know, we attach great importance to the partnership that we have developed with the LGA. We shall continue to meet the association and discuss with it issues that affect local government. However, we will not abrogate our responsibilities; and we accept that that is a Government responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady not accept that her responses to my right hon. Friends the Members for Skipton and Ripon and for North Essex indicate the opposite? If the proposal goes forward, she will hit one section of local authorities and not the other; she will totally turn back the partnership that she speaks about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that we shall lose that position. Therefore, I am not prepared to speculate or start hares running in the way that Opposition Members want—that would create uncertainty outside and I am not prepared to do it. I will not have Opposition Members trying to push me down that route. I am being honest; the measure, which is part of a Government legislation, will be implemented this year and the regulations for it have been laid. I will therefore not concede it before we have even got through the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister is saying that because she has is mind the fact that many Labour Members are strongly opposed to the council tax benefit limitation subsidy, as are the Local Government
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I1023">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 531</span>
Association and the 196 local authorities that responded to the consultation exercise. If the Minister now admits that losing the clause would mean that the system could not go ahead this year, she may face a rebellion among her Back Benchers. Is that not what she is frightened of?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not realise that I seemed frightened—I am far from frightened. I am saying that local authorities are setting their budgets; the Department has been informed of the budgets of more than 20 authorities. Those budgets have taken the regulations into account and it is not my job to set hares running by responding to speculative questions from Opposition Members. Tempting as that might be, I will not do it.<br><br>
Amendment No. 99 proposes that the Secretary of State should agree with the LGA the factors to be used in deciding whether the budget requirement is excessive. We want to work with the LGA but we do not expect to put Government responsibility on to its shoulders; it has a right to argue and to disagree with Government and that will clearly occur in this case. Agreeing a mechanism with the LGA would put it into a difficult position; presumably, it could continue not to agree and we would then have to find other ways of putting the principle that we are applying into place.<br><br>
The Government have implemented the scheme because we want to make councils responsible for the implications that budgets will have on their taxpayers. We do not believe that councils that levy high council taxes should be able to rely on the national taxpayer to pick up the full bill for the resulting additional council tax benefit. As Opposition Members know—I am in no way hiding it—the LGA opposes in principle the wider council tax benefit subsidy limitation scheme. That is its prerogative and I have discussed the matter with its members in partnership meetings and at the full assembly group meeting.<br><br>
However, that does not mean that we accept the reasoning of the LGA. Building in delays to give the LGA and the Secretary of State time to try and reach agreement on the factors for forming an opinion would not realise the Government's aims. We hope that councils will budget prudently and that the council tax benefit subsidy limitation scheme will remain as it is—with the Government and the national taxpayer picking up 95 per cent, of the cost. One way in which we can ensure that councils budget prudently is by strengthening local financial accountability so that increases in local taxation are borne locally. I cannot accept the amendment.<br><br>
My hon. Friends tabled amendment No. 196 with the aim of introducing a "sunset" element into the clause. We discussed many aspects of the principle of the amendment last week, in relation to other amendments. As I have said, the scheme is given effect by other regulations. If it proved necessary or desirable to end the scheme, that would have to be done by altering the regulations and that is the route that we would take. The clause would have no effect without a scheme being in force and, in such circumstances, could be repealed in good time.<br><br>
Although I appreciate the evident hope of all hon. Members that local authorities will budget prudently in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 532</span>
future and will not fall into the purview of the scheme, we want to ensure that, if it needs to be operated at all, it is operated effectively. For that reason, I cannot accept that the enabling clause should be subject to a limit that we would not want to risk for the rest of the scheme.<br><br>
I appreciate that members of the Committee want to debate the scheme as a whole. There will be an opportunity to do so in Standing Committee when the regulation is debated. The clause is an enabling clause to allow the precepting authorities to pay the billing authorities. At present, it would be illegal if the billing authorities insisted that they did so. That is why the clause is in the Bill and why I have spoken to the amendments in the way that I did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we continue the debate on the amendments, I remind hon. Members that the Committee will sit until 11.30 this morning. In the absence of other directions, it will be up to hon. Members to make individual arrangements, through the usual channels, if they wish to leave in time for Prayers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel a bit sorry for the Minister having to deal with social security matters. She is not an expert, and neither am I, and the regulations are near to being incomprehensible, as such regulations often are. She said that the corpse is buried elsewhere; we are simply trying to describe the coffin.<br><br>
If we were to delete the clause, it would not necessarily stop the regulations, but it would stop them working. The Government would then have no practical option but to pull them. I am not setting a hare running; I am trying to talk sensibly about how things work in the real world. In local government, the people who precept are not the same as those who bill. The purpose of the clause is to allow the penalties for what the Government describe as excessive taxes to fall back on the person who has done the levying. That power does not currently exist, so the regulations could not go ahead without the clause. Indeed, under the present law, people would have a perverse incentive to take advantage of the lacunae. It would be a marvellous opportunity to make somebody else pay for one's own virtues or sins, depending on how they were seen.<br><br>
When we discussed the local government finance settlement, the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien), who may be with us this afternoon, made a powerful plea against this regulation. He described the problem by suggesting that the regulations fell disproportionately on local authorities with a large number of band A council tax properties—in other words, those with the poorest house-owning council tax payers. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"If a council in the poorer group of local authorities tried to increase its council tax over its budget requirement to sustain services, the application of the council tax benefit subsidy limitation scheme would be devastating, because of the clawback of the rate support grant.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The council tax benefit is payable to help people who cannot afford to pay their council tax. It is a social benefit and, I believe, it should be the responsibility of the Government to meet the cost. Such direct welfare costs should not be a charge on the resources of local authorities. I emphasise that I am speaking of the poorer council group in local government."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 4 February 1999; Vol. 324, c. 1152.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I1024">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 533</span>
The hon. Member for Normanton asked the Minister for a meeting to talk about the Government reconsidering the scheme. I do not know whether such a meeting took place, but clearly the representations of the Minister's hon. Friend had no effect because we are now faced with these regulations.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
It is worth while spelling out what the regulations mean. I raised a point of order because we cannot debate the clause unless we understand to what it relates. If we did that, the discussion would be meaningless. I shall pay great attention to keeping in order, but I want members of the Committee to understand what we are discussing.<br><br>
The council tax benefit limitation scheme aims to create an offence of excessive increase above threshold council tax. The threshold is last year's council tax plus 4.5 per cent., or a calculation of incredible algebraic complexity, which would allow a council that wished to spend its cash SSA increase to do that without breaching the threshold. Once the threshold is hit, a taper determines how much of the excess will be paid by councils—in other words, council tax payers—rather than the Government. Therefore, if a council spends 0.5 per cent, above 4.5 per cent., the taper represents an eighth, which will be paid out of local resources, and spending 1 per cent, above 4.5 per cent, means that a quarter will be paid out of local resources. However, if 3.5 per cent.—the source of those figures is a mystery to me—above 4.5 per cent, is spent, the local taxpayer will have to pay the whole cost.<br><br>
The sum that is to be clawed back is calculated according to a formula, which is based on more algebra: C represents the council tax that the council wants to levy; N represents the threshold council tax; T represents the tax base, and B represents the proportion of council tax yield from benefits or from 16 per cent, if the real figure is above 16 per cent.—that percentage constitutes another crucial part of the arithmetic. I see that my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex is catching on. Finally, Z represents the taper.<br><br>
I know that you, Mr. Gale, with your long experience in the House, will understand all that. My hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley caught on immediately. It means that highly geared local authorities are most affected. For local authorities that need big council tax increases to provide an incremental budget increase, the less favourable the gearing ratio, the more easily they go through the taper. That is the key point. I do not claim that the Government have not introduced some equalisation, but that it is not sufficient.<br><br>
For a given increase in budget, local authorities hit a higher level of taper, or clawback, more easily. Mole Valley, is the archetypal well-heeled local authority. The area has been cited as being relatively affluent. In practice, that local authority would be affected 10 times less than Liverpool, Hackney or Newham by the regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Keeble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman accept the basic principle that local authorities that comprise many people on low incomes have a particular responsibility not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 534</span>
to increase the council tax suddenly? The local authority that I led froze the council tax for three years. That policy was hugely popular locally because people did not want big increases in council tax, even though most of them received council or poll tax benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Lady, but her comments support my points. Places such as Newham, Hackney and Liverpool have many properties in the lower bands and many people on council tax benefit. Those in bands A and B, who constitute the tax base in those areas, will be hit to cover the clawback, or the self-financed element.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Keeble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that we are considering the effect on people with small disposable incomes of what we would call small increases in their council tax? That is why this measure is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that it is the Government's intention—as it was the previous Government's—to try to establish a mechanism to discourage local authorities from increasing council tax if that burden would fall on the national taxpayer. The Government claim that they have established an equalisation scheme that resolves the problem that I have described. My argument—no doubt this will be bashed out in due course in the relevant Committee—is that it will not work. It can work to an extent, but not sufficiently. It will not prevent the major burden of the financing of that part of the increase that devolves back on the local authority from falling on people in the lowest council tax bands. That is because of the gearing effect of the finances of the relevant local authorities, as well as their social geography or sociology.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend pursue further the line of thought suggested by the remarks of the hon. Member for Northampton, North and consider the local authorities which, because of the way in which the regulations will be applied, will have their limits set at below SSA? I am thinking of Brent, Ealing, Lewisham, Newham and similar authorities. The hon. Lady should consider the other side of the matter—expenditure on services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely agree. Of course, local authorities for which the gearing is favourable, of the sort with which my hon. Friend will be familiar, will encounter a completely different order of problem—much less than those to which he and I have been referring.<br><br>
Three keys are involved in sorting out this issue—the gearing, the taper and the proportion of council tax yield from benefits, even at the 16 per cent, average. The regulations that we shall be helping to bring into effect— let us be clear; if we do not pass the measure, they will not work—will put the burden of financing the very poor on the nearly poor. Support for people in the council house will fall disproportionately on people in the band A and B properties, simply because of the nature of the local authority in which they live.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V004P0I1025">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 535</span>
That is why this is a nasty piece of legislation, I am sorry that we shall have to give it fair wind—I imagine that that is what will eventually happen—but it should not happen without a protest about its effects. It will hit the poorest people and it is interesting that it comes from a Government who have spent so much time talking about combating social exclusion.<br><br>
I asked the Minister about the difference between Scotland, Wales and England. An item from the <i>Local Government Chronicle</i> of 5 February, headed "LGA dismay at Prescott tax plans" states, among other things, that the LGA
<br><blockquote><p>"wanted the maximum amount of subsidy clawed back pegged at 0.5 per cent. of a council's budget requirement instead of 1 per cent., to bring England into line with plans for Scotland and Wales."</p></blockquote>
I know that we now have devolution, and I am not against it, but I would be worried were it increasingly to result in different burdens falling on people in the different parts of the United Kingdom, causing people to feel that there is not a level playing field in that respect. That will increasingly happen. I should like a reply to my question about whether the burden on local authorities in Scotland and Wales will be less than that on exactly equivalent local authorities in England taking exactly equivalent steps.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak to amendments Nos. 99, 100 and 39, but also to agree with the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon that the clause is a particularly nasty one. Opposing it would not prevent the council tax benefit subsidy limitation scheme from becoming law. It would, however, mean that the billing authorities could not reclaim if the precepting authorities exceeded the guideline. That would be a recipe for disaster in local government, and I cannot believe that the Minister or the Secretary of State would want it to happen. For that reason, if there were to be a vote on clause 24, and if by some happy chance Labour Members who were unhappy about it voted against it and it was defeated, that would be the end of this nasty scheme.<br><br>
Clause 24(3) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may base his opinion on such factors as he thinks fit".</p></blockquote>
Government amendment No. 235 introduces a welcome mention of criteria rather than opinion. We support that. Our amendment No. 99 would replace the whim and fancy of the Secretary of State with the requirement to reach agreement with those partners of which we keep hearing, the Local Government Association. We do not believe that that would be an abrogation of the Government's responsibility; we think that it would give proper teeth to the partnership on which the Government are so keen.<br><br>
Amendment No. 100 requires the Secretary of State to
<br><blockquote><p>"publish all factors he takes into account in reaching his opinion",</p></blockquote>
a refrain to which we keep referring in an attempt to increase the clarity and accountability of the Secretary of State's actions. It would be nice to think that the Minister would change her mind and take the amendment on board.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 536</span>
Amendment No. 39 would roll forward the date to the year 2000. The Bill will not be through the House before April 1999. Therefore, this is retrospective legislation which we are told local authorities, now have to take into account when setting their council tax, although I understand that the impact of this scheme, as we heard from the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, differs throughout the country.<br><br>
For example, Vale of White Horse district council, will have a council tax rise of approximately 8 per cent. It is not worried about the scheme because it will have minimal impact there—they will lose a very small amount—whereas East Sussex county council, which I accept is a different tier of authority with a much higher budget, will suffer a loss of £250,000, according to what I last heard about its planned council tax rise. Some authorities will not need to worry because they have so few people on council tax benefit that they can set council tax at 8 per cent, and not suffer an impact, but there are others for which a rise of 1.5 per cent, above the guideline will have a major impact. That cannot be fair, transparent or accountable.<br><br>
In a previous debate about best value, we tried to move the repeal of CCT backwards, but that was resisted by the Government. It would be nice if they could balance that resistance by not resisting amendment No. 39, which would move forward the date for the scheme to begin. I accept that if we were successful with the amendment, it would not reverse the scheme because of the requirement for an amendment to the regulations also—which Liberal Democrats have prayed against and on which a debate will take place elsewhere.<br><br>
We are told constantly about how intent the Government are on sticking to every jot and tittle of their manifesto. But this proposal was not in the Labour party manifesto.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Lady noticed that, whenever we speak about something that is not in the manifesto, the Minister talks about going beyond it, as if whatever it is were simply a natural extension of it.
