	<div class='title'>—(POWER FOR SHOPKEEPER TO SELL UNCOLLECTED GOODS RECEIVED FOR REPAIR OR OTHER TREATMENT.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to call attention to the fact that adequate notice should be given of Amendments, as moving them without notice causes inconvenience. As a general rule, I do not intend to call manuscript Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Elaine Burton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish the Committee to agree to this Motion, and it may be of assistance if I explain very briefly the reasons for various Amendments which appear on the Order Paper in my own name and the names of the other sponsors of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have allowed me the services of their advisers, who, while preserving the substance of the Bill, have redrafted it in terms which may be of more precise legal meaning, and I should like to explain this when we come to the actual new Clauses. While the substance of the Bill has been preserved, certain provisions which I shall describe later have been added in order to safeguard customer's interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coldrick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be in order for me to give an indication why some of my hon. Friends and myself have put down certain Amendments. We did so in order that we might receive some clear explanation of what is now contained in the Clause. I will give a general welcome to the Bill, because I think it will render a very useful service, but, when we put down these Amendments, we did so for purposes of clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1326</span>
First of all, we want to know precisely what was meant by the term "shop," and if the term was sufficiently extensive in order to cover factories, laundries, and places of that nature. I take it, for instance, that if there is a business which has a repair factory, and boots and shoes are delivered to the shop and then collected from the shop and taken to the factory, later being returned to the shop and collected by the customer, these people are covered in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then, there is a practice which is quite common in the Co-operative movement, and I know much more about that than certain other practices, in which we find that a laundry is attached to the business of the society. Instead of the articles being delivered to the society, they are for the sake of economy taken direct to the laundry and returned from the laundry to the customer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such cases, we were not certain, as the Bill was originally drafted, whether that could be considered as coming within the definition of the term "shop," although, obviously, it is connected with the same business and the practice is very similar to what happens with boot and shoe repairs, except for the fact that the goods do not actually take the same course of passing through the shop. Obviously, the work has been executed according to the customer's requirements, and I take it that the whole purpose of the Bill is to see that people who have carried out repairs at the request of another person shall be paid for the work actually done, and it was on that point that we merely wanted some clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, in the same connection, we frequently find in the Co-operative movement—and I suppose it is common to all businesses—that, in the case of a small society or even a number of small societies, where it would be obviously impossible to set up a boot repairing factory or a laundry to meet the requirements of a limited number of members, these local societies federate for that purpose, and we find that they operate a local factory covering a number of societies. Again, the goods are deposited directly with the boot repairing factory or laundry, and, after repairs have been executed the goods are returned directly to the customer.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1327</span>
In so far as these practices are covered by the Bill, we shall be happy to withdraw our Amendments, but I should like to have an assurance upon this particular point, because, as I have read the Bill, it seems to me that these practices may not be covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Burton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to my hon. Friend, may I say that the point which he has made is now covered in the new Clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>NEW CLAUSE.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(POWER OF BAILEES TO SELL GOODS ACCEPTED FOR REPAIR OR OTHER TREATMENT BUT NOT REDELIVERED.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>This Act shall apply in relation to the bailment of any goods accepted (whether before or after the commencement of this Act) by the bailee, in the course of a business, for repair or other treatment on the terms (express or implied) that they will be re-delivered to the bailor or in accordance with bailor's directions when the repair or other treatment has been carried out and on payment to the bailee of such charges as may be agreed between the parties or as may be reasonable.
	<ol>
	<li>Where goods accepted as aforesaid are ready for re-delivery but the bailor fails both—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>to pay or tender to the bailee his charges in relation to the goods; and</li>
	<li>to take delivery of the goods or, if the terms of the bailment so provide, to give directions as to their delivery,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1328</span>
the bailee shall, subject to the provisions of any agreement between him and the bailor and to the following provisions of this section, be entitled, while the failure continues, to sell the goods.</li></ol>
	<li>The bailee shall not be entitled by virtue of the last foregoing subsection to sell goods accepted by him for repair or other treatment unless the following provisions are complied with, that is to say:—
	<ol>
	<li>where the goods are so accepted after the commencement of this Act, a notice is, at the time of the acceptance, conspicuously displayed in the part of the premises used or appropriated for the acceptance for repair or other treatment of goods of the class to which the goods accepted belong, indicating that the acceptance by the bailee of goods of that class for repair or other treatment is subject to the provisions of this Act and that this Act confers on the bailee a right of sale exercisable in certain circumstances after an interval of not less than twelve months from the date on which the goods are ready for re-delivery;</li>
	<li>after the goods are ready for redelivery, or after the commencement of this Act, whichever is the later, the bailee gives to the bailor a notice that the goods are ready for re-delivery, being a notice complying with the requirements of subsection (6) of this section;</li>
	<li>after the expiration of the period of twelve months beginning with the date of the giving of the notice that the goods are ready for re-delivery and not less than fourteen days before the sale of the goods, the bailee gives to the bailor a notice of his intention to sell the goods, being a notice complying with the requirements of the said subsection (6),</li></ol>
and the bailee shall not be so entitled to sell the goods otherwise than by auction;</li>
	<li>Provided that where the notice of the bailee's intention to sell the goods states, in addition to the matters required to be contained therein by the said subsection (6), the lowest price which he is prepared to accept on a sale of the goods by virtue of this section, he may sell the goods for not less than that price otherwise than by auction.</li>
	<li>Where at any time before the giving of the notice of the bailee's intention to sell the goods a dispute arises between the bailor and the bailee by reason of the bailor's refusal to pay the sum which the bailee claims to be due to him by way of his charges in relation to the goods, or to take delivery thereof or give directions as to their delivery, on the ground that the charges are excessive or that the bailor is not satisfied that the repair or other treatment of the goods has been properly carried out, the bailee's right to sell the goods shall be suspended until the dispute is determined.</li>
	<li>A dispute shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as having been determined if, but only if, the bailee at any time after the dispute has arisen gives to the bailor a notice (hereinafter in this Act referred to as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1951-1952V000P0I0694">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1329</span>
a "notice to treat the dispute as determined")—
	<ol>
	<li>stating that, unless within the period of one month beginning with the date of the giving of the notice, the bailor objects thereto, the dispute will at the expiration of that period be treated for the purposes of this Act as having been determined; and</li>
	<li>in other respects complying with the requirements of subsection (6) of this section,</li></ol>
and within the said period of one month the bailor does not object to the notice; and where the dispute is treated for the purposes of this Act as having been determined, subsection (3) of this section shall have effect in relation to the goods which are the subject of the dispute as if paragraph (	<i>b</i>) thereof were omitted and as if for the reference in paragraph (	<i>c</i>) thereof to the notice that the goods are ready for re-delivery there were substituted a reference to the notice to treat the dispute as determined.</li>
	<li>A notice required or authorised by this section to be given by the bailee to the bailor must contain a sufficient description of the goods to which the notice relates and a statement of the sum which the bailee claims to be due to him by way of his charges in relation to the goods, together with—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>in the case of a notice that the goods are ready for re-delivery or a notice to treat the dispute as determined, a statement that if the bailor fails, within the period of twelve months beginning with the date of the giving of the notice, both to pay the said sum and to take delivery of the goods or give directions as to their delivery they are liable to be sold in accordance with the provisions of this Act;</li>
	<li>in the case of a notice of the bailee's intention to sell the goods, a statement of the date on which the notice that the goods were ready for re-delivery or, as the case may be, the notice to treat the dispute as determined was given and a statement that if the bailor fails, within the period of fourteen days beginning with the date of the giving of the notice of the bailee's intention to sell the goods, both to pay the said sum and to take delivery of the goods or give directions as to their delivery they are liable to be sold in accordance with the provisions of this Act.—[	<i>Miss Burton.</i>]</li></ol></ol></p>
	<p>Brought up, and read the First time.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Burton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I explained at the beginning of our proceedings, we have been fortunate in having the services of the Government's advisers on the drafting of this Bill. Furthermore, I stated that although the wording has been altered the substance of the Bill has been left very much the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might perhaps explain here that the advisers have thought it necessary to use
	<span class='label label-info column'>1330</span>
the technical terms "bailment," "bailor" and "bailee," which have a precise legal meaning. I am informed that a bailment is a delivery of goods by one person called a bailor to another person called a bailee, for a specific purpose with a view to the re-delivery of the goods to the bailor after the purpose has been fulfilled. The bailor may be described as the customer and the bailee as the trader. It may be clearer to the Committee, and certainly it will be easier for me, if subsequently I refer to the bailor as the customer and to the bailee as the trader.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The particular kind of bailment or transaction with which this Bill deals is a delivery of goods by the customer to the trader for repair or other treatment with a view to re-delivery after the repair or other treatment has been completed and after payment of a charge agreed between the trader and the customer or a reasonable charge if there is no agreed charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsections (1) and (2) of this new Clause provide that where a trader has accepted goods from a customer for repair or other treatment the trader may, if certain conditions are fulfilled, sell the goods if the customer fails both to pay or to tender the amount due to the trader or fails to take delivery of the goods or arrange for their delivery. The Clause applies whether the goods are handed in by the customer at the premises of the trader or sent to or collected by the trader, and to goods accepted before or after the Bill comes into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) states the conditions which must be fulfilled before the trader may sell. These are, first, that a notice must be displayed in the premises of the trader where goods may be handed in for repair or other treatment calling the attention of customers to the fact that (	<i>a</i>) this Bill, when it becomes an Act, applies to goods of that kind accepted by the trader, and (	<i>b</i>) that the Bill confers a right of sale in certain circumstances. This condition, of course, does not apply where the goods were accepted before this Bill comes into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second condition is that the trader has given the customer notice that the goods are ready for re-delivery. The third condition is that not less than 12 months later the trader has given the customer notice that he intends to sell the goods, and at least 14 days have elapsed from the giving of that notice.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1331</span>
The reason for requiring the display of a notice on the trader's premises is to let the customer know when he hands in his goods that this Measure gives the trader a right to sell those goods in certain circumstances. This will not help customers who, because their goods are either sent or collected, do not go to the trader's premises, but I think it would be difficult for the trader in those circumstances to call the attention of customers to his rights under the Bill, and it would be unreasonable to require him to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second point, the reason for requiring a notice to be given to the customer that the goods are ready for redelivery is to ensure that the customer is informed that the work on the goods has been completed and that they are ready for him. The reason for requiring a notice of intention to sell the goods at least twelve months after notice that the goods are ready is to give the customer both an ample opportunity to pay what he owes and what is, in effect, a final reminder. It is clearly necessary to allow 14 days after giving this notice so as to allow the customer to act upon it if he wishes. The goods must be sold by auction unless the trader has included in his notice of intention to sell them the price at which he is prepared to sell them—in which case he may sell them otherwise than by auction, provided he does not sell them for less than that price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) states that as a dispute may arise between a customer and a trader as to whether the work has been properly carried out or as to whether the charges are excessive, the Clause provides that if such a dispute arises before the trader has given notice of his intention to sell the goods, the trader's right to sell is suspended while the dispute continues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dispute can only be ended for the purposes of the Bill, and the trader's right of sale revived, by the trader giving to the customer a notice to treat the dispute as determined. If the customer does not object to that notice within one month the dispute is then treated as ended. This notice takes the place of the notice informing the customer that the goods are ready for re-delivery, and the 12-month period which must elapse before the giving of the notice of an intention to sell the goods runs from it.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1332</span>
Subsection (6) provides that the notices must contain sufficient information to enable the customer to know the rights of the trader under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should stress here as a general point that the Bill will not apply automatically to goods of any kind accepted by a trader for repair or other treatment. It will not apply at all unless (	<i>a</i>) in the case of goods accepted after the Bill comes into force the trader has taken the preliminary step of displaying a notice calling the attention of customers to the fact that the Act, as it will then be, applies to the acceptance of goods of that kind and that it confers a right of sale in certain circumstancea; and (	<i>b</i>) in the case of goods accepted before the Bill comes into force, if he takes the preliminary step of sending out a notice, in accordance with the requirement of the Bill, that the goods are ready for redelivery. In addition, the Bill will not apply if the customer agrees with the trader that it shall not apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Fletcher-Cooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure we all congratulate the hon. Lady the Member for Coventry, South (Miss Burton) once again on her efforts and her skill in connection with this Bill. But I must make a mild protest, though no more than that. The hon. Lady has said that this new Clause is a matter of re-drafting and is purely verbal. The wording has been altered and it is not possible for hon. Members to do justice to what is a complete new draft at this first blush. It may be our own fault; it may be that these Amendments have been on the Order Paper for some time. I do not know, but I find myself in great difficulty from seeing them this morning for the first time. However, one cannot carry that matter further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to have some information on this question of a dispute. In subsection (4) of the Clause, quite properly, provision is made for the customer to object if he considers that the goods have not been repaired properly. But he cannot have any opportunity to object until the goods have been re-delivered to him. Therefore, at first sight, it is a little difficult to see how a dispute on that important point can arise because, 	<i>a fortiori</i>, the goods are in the possession of the bailee—the trader—and therefore the customer has not had the opportunity for a proper examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1951-1952V000P0I0696">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1333</span>
Subsection (5) of the new Clause states
	<br><blockquote><p>"A dispute shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as having been determined if, but only if, the bailee at any time after the dispute has arisen gives to the bailor a notice (hereinafter in this Act referred to as a 'notice to treat the dispute as determined')—…"</p></blockquote>
Then it goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… and within the said period of one month the bailor does not object to the notice; …"</p></blockquote>
How can the customer know whether to object or not if he has not examined the goods and if he has had no opportunity for examination 	<i>a fortiori,</i> because, if the goods have not been re-delivered or collected, the purpose of the Bill at this point does not apply. There may be a short answer to that. I expect there is, but it is an illustration of the difficulty we have in dealing with a new Clause after having seen it for the first time a quarter of an hour ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Lynn Ungoed-Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise very much with the hon. Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) in dealing with a Clause of this kind when, as in this case, he has only seen it for the first time this morning. I have seen this Clause before this morning, but I cannot say that I have studied it in great detail. However, I think the answer to the hon. Member is reasonably clear if he will be so good as to follow my observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The bailee shall not be entitled by virtue of the last foregoing subsection to sell goods accepted by him for repair or other treatment unless the following provisions are complied with, that is to say:—…"</p></blockquote>
Then paragraph (	<i>b</i>) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"after the goods are ready for re-delivery, or after the commencement of this Act, whichever is the later, the bailee gives to the bailor a notice that the goods are ready for redelivery …"</p></blockquote>
It goes on, in paragraph (	<i>c</i>):
	<br><blockquote><p>"after the expiration of the period of twelve months beginning with the date of the giving of the notice that the goods are ready for re-delivery and not less than fourteen days before the sale of the goods, the bailee gives to the bailor a notice of his intention to sell the goods, being a notice complying with the requirements of the said subsection (6),…"</p></blockquote>
First, there is the notice of readiness for re-delivery and then a notice of intention to sell, that is,
	<br><blockquote><p>"…before the sale of the goods, the bailee gives to the bailor a notice of his intention to sell the goods,…."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1334</span>
That is to say—if I may interpret—in between the notice that the goods are ready for re-delivery and the notice of intention to sell there comes into operation subsection (4) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where at any time before the giving of the notice of the bailee's intention to sell the goods a dispute arises between the bailor and the bailee by reason of the bailor's refusal to pay the sum which the bailee claims to be due to him by way of his charges in relation to the goods, or to take delivery thereof or give directions as to their delivery, on the ground that the charges are excessive or that the bailor is not satisfied that the repair or other treatment of the goods has been properly carried out, the bailee's right to sell the goods shall be suspended until the dispute is determined."</p></blockquote>
That comes into operation between the notice of re-delivery and the sale, so the customer has an opportunity there of seeing the goods and of disputing any claim there may be as to the amount to be paid on them. I think the hon. Member's point is covered by the way the scheme works out. The difficulty arises probably because subsection (4), which comes into operation between subsections (3, 	<i>b</i>) and (3, 	<i>c</i>), is inserted where it is. If the hon. Member had had more opportunity to study the matter I am sure the confusion in his mind would not have arisen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

When one takes a watch or a pair of shoes to a trader now, very often one's name is taken. Am I to understand that if only the name is taken, he would not in any circumstances be able to benefit by this Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I still think that is short notice, and it was no one's fault but mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to a dispute arising before goods are delivered, it seems to me, from the layman's point of view, that could happen. If a customer goes to a shop, looks at the goods and refuses to take delivery because he does not think they have been well done, that is a matter which could be argued then and there. I would like to give an assurance to the hon. Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) that we shall examine in more detail this question of determining disputes between now and the Report stage. With regard to the point raised by the hon. Member for the Isle of Thanet (Mr. Carson), the answer is "Yes". In so far as this matter, when first brought forward, dealt more with footwear repair traders than any others, that point, of course, did arise. Many of us know that the person who we call the small boot repairer does not keep addresses, and I did make it plain to them that if there was any hope of getting the bill through the House it would be necessary to keep such details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percy Holman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with those who have protested against the very short notice we have had of these new Clauses. The week-end intervened and few, if any, of us saw them until Saturday morning. As hon. Members do not normally reach the House early on Monday morning, the earliest time for seeing them would be about midday. In these circumstances, we have not been able to consult with those who are authorities on these matters. While at first glance I ihink this Clause is a good Clause and that its objects are in accordance with what we feel is essential for dealing with widespread, although fairly small, grievances covering a large number of traders, at this stage it is difficult for us to see if it is workable, as it is somewhat complicated compared with the original Bill which was very simple from the small boot repairer's point of view. We know that the bulk of that trade is in the hands of small folk who just write down one's name on the sole of a shoe, and say, "It
	<span class='label label-info column'>1336</span>
will be ready in a week." In the larger towns where the trade is more impersonal, in 99 cases out of 100 the small trader may know one by sight, but no more than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we should have an assurance on the Report stage that there will be sympathetic consideration of any Amendments which arise from the point of view of any considerable group in the community who may feel a certain grievance from the fact that it has not been possible for them to give consideration to these Clauses, prior to the Committee considering the matter this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Clause provides that notices given must be in writing and that the notice of an intention to sell must be given by registered post to the last known address of the customer. That was quite definitely defined in the first draft of the Bill which everyone saw. We knew that notifications must be by registered post. However, other notices may be given by the trader to the customer either personally or by leaving it at the customer's last known address, or by ordinary post to that address.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Clause is similar to the one which was in the first draft of the Bill. It provides that if the proceeds of sale exceed the trader's charges, the customer may recover the difference, or, if the charges exceed the proceeds of sale, the customer remains liable to pay the amount still outstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (2), the trader is required to keep for a period of six years records and certain documents in relation to any goods sold under the Bill. This is already provided for under the Limitation Act, 1939, within which, an action must be brought by the customer for wrongful sale of the goods or for the recovery of any surplus from the proceeds of sale. These records and documents must be produced by the trader at any reasonable time at the request of the customer or someone acting for him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) concerns penalties which are provided in case of failure to keep or produce such records or documents and in the case of production of false records or documents. I would add for the benefit of laymen like myself on the Committee that the penalties set down are apparently much less than those which would have been incurred in the first Bill by omission. I raise that point because we appreciate that these are maximum penalties, and I would deprecate any Member of the Committee feeling that the small shopkeeper or trader was likely to have to pay £100 if he slipped up on a small matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This, as the Committee will realise, is largely a definition Clause. The effect of subsection (1) is that the Bill only applies to businesses, in the course of which goods are accepted for repair or other treatment, if they are wholly or partly carried on at premises open to public access; it makes no difference whether or not the repair or other treatment is carried out on those premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) contains the phrase, "the charges of the bailee." That means the trader's charge for the repair or other treatment of the goods. This charge is the charge agreed between the trader and the customer, or, as so often happens, if there is no agreed charge, a reasonable charge. In addition, where the trader has given notice of his intention to sell the goods, the phrase includes a reasonable charge for the storage of goods from the date when the period of 12 months started to run, any costs which the trader may have incurred with a view to selling the goods, such as advertising and cartage, the costs, if any, of insurance, and, where the goods have been sold, the costs of the sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1340</span>
Subsection (3) provides that where the rights and obligations of a trader or customer have passed to another person, that person shall be treated as the trader or customer, as the case may be, for the purposes of the Bill. Subsection (4) provides that the Bill shall not prejudice any other right the trader may have to sell the goods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite clear about the hon. Lady's explanation of subsection (2, 	<i>a</i>), which deals with storage at a reasonable charge. Does that charge start from when the first notice is given to the customer that his goods are ready, which may occur within a fortnight of the goods being handed in, or is it a charge for storage after the 12 months and after notice has been given that the vendor is going to sell the goods?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coldrick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Originally we put down an Amendment to leave out the words, "public access." Subsection (1, 	<i>b</i>) of this Clause states:

We want to be clear about what "open to public access" means. Generally speaking, it means that a business is open in the sense that people can deposit their boots, clothing, jewellery, or whatever it is. On the other hand, the place where repairs are actually carried out are not open to public access. This is frequently so in the case of a laundry. It is true that one can go to the office, but I cannot imagine any laundry wanting people walking round the works. We want to know precisely what is meant by "open to public access"; and if it is possible to eliminate these words, I think the purpose would be served without any damage being done to any person involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1341</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might, or it might not be, I quite agree.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-East (Mr. Coldrick) has given me some concern. Subsection (1) of the proposed new Clause says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"References in this Act to goods accepted in the course of a business for repair or other treatment shall, in relation to goods of any class, be construed as references to goods of that class accepted for repair or other treatment in the course of a business which,"</p></blockquote>
and then, in paragraph (	<i>b</i>),
	<br><blockquote><p>"is wholly or partly carried on at premises open to public access."</p></blockquote>
Cases where a shop is involved in the business clearly come within the Clause. If there is any place to which the public can go to deliver or collect goods or do anything of that kind in any part of the business, the premises are open to public access. I should have thought there was no difficulty up to that point and that all the cases mentioned by my hon. Friend were covered. Perhaps he can produce a case, such as of a laundry or a repair factory where there is no place at all for public access, but I should have thought that some part of the premises would be open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my hon. Friend has in mind the shop which accepts goods and sends them to a factory for repair, but such cases would come within the proposed new Clause. I do not think he will find any case outside it, but if he has any particular case in mind which he considers to be outside I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1342</span>
South (Miss Burton) would consider it very sympathetically. I do not think there is any matter of substance, by way of objection to the Clause, in what my hon. Friend raised. I think it is all substantially covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise one point myself. This may be rather unorthodox behaviour in one of the sponsors of the Bill, but I am not responsible for the re-drafting. The original very simple draft which commended itself so much to the hon. Member for the Isle of Thanet was a lawyer's draft, but the complicated one is a redraft for which lawyers—at any rate not official lawyers—are not responsible. I cannot say that I have had an opportunity of studying the new draft with the utmost care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I am raising is very much in line with the point raised by the hon. Member for the Isle of Thanet and concerns the words in subsection (2 	<i>a</i>) of the proposed new Clause:
	<br><blockquote><p>"ready for re-delivery."</p></blockquote>
This gives me the opportunity to raise a point which occurs in subsection (1) in the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"goods accepted…for repair or other treatment."</p></blockquote>
The situation contemplated is that these goods are ready for re-delivery but the bailor fails to take delivery of the goods. In the original draft of the Bill the corresponding words were:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the owner has not collected the goods or taken delivery thereof."</p></blockquote>
I shall be most grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade can assist me by saying whether the words "take delivery of the goods" impose any kind of obligation upon the trader to deliver the goods to the customer. This is in line with the point whether the address of the customer should be taken by the trader and whether there is an obligation on the trader to offer delivery to the customer. Where no address is given at all is it up to the customer to go to the trader's premises and to attempt to collect the goods? I am not sure of the effect of the words to which I have referred and which are allied to the word "re-delivery" in the proposed new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

ments. On the point raised by the hon. Member for Bristol, North-East (Mr. Coldrick) I think it is immaterial whether the place where the repairs are carried out is open to public access or not, but some part of the business must be open. That is the position in the Bill as it now stands and it was so in the Bill as originally drawn. That was involved in the word "shop," which does not now appear in the Bill because of its vagueness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In passing, perhaps I might mention the point raised by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Portsmouth, West (Brigadier Clarke) who made certain remarks about lawyers. Both the original draft and the draft that represents the Bill as it now stands are the work of lawyers. Speaking as a former practitioner, I can assure him that the Bill is now likely to give lawyers less work than the original Bill would have done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cledwyn Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister agree that the type of business where no customer calls because the goods are always collected and delivered by van is covered by the Clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strauss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said distinctly that some part of the business must be open to public access, but I can think of cases, such as some laundries, which would not fall within the provisions of the Bill as now drawn. This is of little importance, I think, especially in view of the practice of laundries in making their own contracts and of the desire of a great many laundries not to make use of the Bill. That is not necessarily a disadvantage but is a question of policy. The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that there are conceivable cases of businesses which will be outside the Bill now as they would have been outside the original Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Leicester, North-East (Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas) referred to the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"to take delivery of the goods"</p></blockquote>
which appear in subsection (2, 	<i>b</i>) of the New Clause ("POWER OF BAILEES TO SELL GOODS ACCEPTED FOR REPAIR OR OTHER TREATMENT BUT NOT RE-DELIVERED.") Those words do not impose a new or additional obligation on the bailee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the hon. and learned Gentleman practises in those Chancery
	<span class='label label-info column'>1344</span>
Courts where cases are decided by the light of reason alone. If he had had more experience in the vulgar courts—[	<i>Laughter</i>]—I do not mean "vulgar" but ordinary—in which some of us have practised, he would know that the words "take delivery of" are quite common form and impose no new obligation on a trader. The trader has not to seek out the customer. He has to be prepared to re-deliver the goods according to contract, whatever it may be. The expression "to take delivery of" does not impose any obligation on him to send the goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the question of knowing the address. I do not think that is material to the point which the hon. and learned Gentleman has in mind, but it is material, although this point has not been raised, to the sending of a written notice. There is the further point of providing for goods which are at present in traders' hands and where the traders do not know the addresses of their customers. The question should be fairly considered between now and the Report stage to see-whether anything further is required to meet that case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would refer briefly to the point brought up by the hon. and learned Member for Leicester, North-East (Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas) and replied to by the Parliamentary Secretary. I agree with what my hon. Friend has said—not that my incursions into the common law courts have had any vulgarity about them, whatever may have been the case with his. own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strauss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was using the word "vulgar" in the classical sense, of course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It must be a consolation to the Committee to know that my hon. Friend retains his classical sense. I agree that his interpretation of the words. "take delivery of" is correct, and that there would be no obligation imposed upon the bailee by those words to seek out or take active steps in regard to the delivery of the goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further provision in subsection (2, 	<i>b</i>) of the same new Clause to cover the case where the bailor fails not only to take delivery of the goods, but,
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the terms of the bailment so provide, to give directions as to their delivery."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1951-1952V000P0I0702">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1345</span>
It is there I think that the question of the effect of giving the address to which the hon. and learned Member referred would come in, that is to say, would the effect of giving the address to the bailee constitute a term of debailment that the goods should be delivered to that address? It might and it might not; it is a question of construction and perhaps of argument in each case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems, having in mind what the hon. and learned Member for Leicester, North-East said, and looking at the wording of the Clause in relation to what is likely to happen, that it would be well if consideration were given to the question of the necessity of giving an address and the effect in relation to the provisions of this Clause of so doing. It seems that it might affect subsection (2, 	<i>b</i>) as well as the narrower matter of the notice to which the Parliamentary Secretary addressed himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not seem that the other point about public access would have much materiality concerning matters sought to be governed by this Bill because, where goods are sent to concerns carrying on business who have not got public access in every case. So far as I can envisage those goods automatically will be sent back to the address from which they came. That is hardly the category of case to which the Bill is intended to apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. Fleetwood-Hesketh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw attention once more to subsection (2, 	<i>a</i>) of the new Clause which refers to "a reasonable charge"? As a layman, I feel a little uneasy about the ante-dating effect of this provision. As I see it, the intention to sell is notified and then the reasonable charge dates back to the time when the notice for redelivery was made. That seems rather drastic and rather contrary to normal relations between customers and traders. I could quite understand it if the reasonable charge ran from the second date and was regarded more as an alternative to sale or as a small recoupment pending the sale, but, to throw it back to perhaps within a fortnight of when the goods were handed over for repair, seems a little drastic and contrary to normal custom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1346</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Burton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fleetwood-Hesketh) I refer again to the footwear industry, with which I have had most discussions. The man in a small shop finds difficulty in providing storage space. That has presented a problem. The suggestion is that a storage charge is only allowed after the notice of intention to sell has been given and is not allowed before then. It is true that when allowed it can be charged as from the date, which would be 12 months previously, when the goods were ready for re-delivery. It seems that the small man is entitled to make some charge for storage from the date when the goods are ready, but, if the hon. Member is not satisfied, I can assure him that I am sure small traders and all of us will reconsider this matter before the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, having seen the notice saying that the trader is going to sell, the customer comes to collect the goods, will the storage charge still apply, or will he get off scot free?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Burton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I would have to have notice of that question. Would the hon. Member be satisfied if we considered that point before the Report stage, because, obviously, it would depend on how soon after the notice the customer came back?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speaking from my impression of reading the Clauses comparatively hurriedly, I believe that the charges do not arise until the sale has taken place because they only arise by way of deduction from the proceeds of sale. I do not think there is any difficulty there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should have the consideration in mind that it is only where the trader has sold or given notice of intention to sell that the question arises. Then it is reasonable to assume that the person who has deposited the goods has never had any intention since the time of delivery of collecting the goods. That is a reasonable kind of inference. I do not say that it would apply in all cases, but it is not unreasonable to assume that. He has not told the trader so, but has lain "doggo" and let the trader go on with his remedy. In those circumstances, there is no hardship on a person who behaves in that way after notice has been given that he should bear the charge which only arises after the sale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I wrong again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strauss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On one small point I think the hon. and learned Member was not quite right. It is not necessary to the right of making a charge that a sale has taken place. The amount is only chargeable after there has been a notice of intention to sell. It should be possible to collect if notice that a sale had taken place had been given. I think the Bill is in order as it stands, but I agree with the suggestion of the hon. Lady the Member for Coventry, South (Miss Burton) that there will be further opportunities to consider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertford (Mr. Walker-Smith) raised for the first time, after
	<br><blockquote><p>"to take delivery of the goods,"</p></blockquote>
the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"or, if the terms of the bailment so provide, to give directions as to their delivery."</p></blockquote>
He asked me whether the mere giving of an address could or would make it a term of the bailment that a delivery at the address of the customer should be effected by the trader. I should say quite clearly not. Those of us who have occasionally to take a watch to be repaired know that the watch repairer is very likely to ask for our address in order that he can notify us when the watch is ready to be collected, but no one supposes that the giving of the address makes it a term of the bailment or an agreement, in ordinary language, that he shall send the watch back. It would be a question in each case as to what is the term of the bailment, but the mere fact of giving an address would not in itself make such delivery a term of the bailment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coldrick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like an assurance before we reach the next stage that the difference between my hon. Friends and other legal luminaries can be cleared up on the question of "open to public access."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know perfectly well what the practices are, and as the Bill is drafted, I do not see the purpose of using those words at all. I can conceive of the case of a laundry, which has been cited, where some people would call for their goods
	<span class='label label-info column'>1348</span>
whereas the great mass of customers would have their goods collected and delivered. Would these words mean that, just because one or two call at that place and go to the office where there is a counter, the place was "open to public access" or not? If this can be looked at again in order to get some clarification, I think it would meet the purpose of the suggested Amendment we put down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strauss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The suggestion was that there was some difference here between the hon. and learned Member for Leicester, North-East (Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas) and myself, but I do not think there is the slightest difference on the point. If the laundry had a counter at which it was prepared to receive such parcels and goods as the public chose to bring, I have no doubt whatever that that would be within the meaning of the words "open to public access."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Burton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I assure my hon.

	<div class='title'>—(APPLICATION TO SCOTLAND.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>This Act shall apply to Scotland subject to the following modifications, that is to say, for any reference to the bailment of goods there shall be substituted a reference to the deposit of goods, and for references to the bailor and to the bailee in relation to any goods there shall be substituted respectively references to the person by whom and to the person with whom the goods are deposited.—[	<i>Mr. W.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. G. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be noticed that we are asking that this Measure should apply to Scotland, with certain modifications. One modification is because "bailor" or "bailee" are not common form in Scotland and we do toot talk about the bailment of goods when they are deposited with a shoe repairer or watch repairer. We therefore make these simple modifications and for the term "bailor" we suggest the person by whom the goods are deposited and for "bailee" the person by whom the goods are received.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1951-1952V000P0I0704">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1349</span>
That is very simple and common form in Scotland, and I do not think there will be any difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to be able to support this proposed new Clause because I had an Amendment down to the original draft that the whole Bill should apply to Scotland. It seemed in its original draft a good little Bill. In spite of what the Parliamentary draftsmen have done, it is still a good little Bill, and I see no reason why it should not apply to Scotland. It must have been deliberately designed that it should not apply because, in the original draft, it was specifically stated that it should not apply either to Scotland or to Northern Ireland. It is difficult to understand why the sponsors should have reached that conclusion, unless they had a theory that no one in Scotland would refrain from collecting goods. That theory was quickly exploded when I discussed the Bill with a group of traders in a shoe-making firm and with the Cooperative Society, of which I am a member. I was assured that there are a large number of people in Scotland who do leave their goods after bringing them for repair and treatment, and, therefore, the Bill should apply to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been pointed out by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Woodside (Mr. W. G. Bennett), in those outlying parts of the United Kingdom they will insist, for technical reasons in defiance of logic, in adhering to a legal system of their own and applying outlandish phraseology which is Greek to the citizens of the major part of the United Kingdom. If I or any other citizen of Scotland is asked what is meant by the term "bailor" or "bailee," we could only hazard a guess that it has something to do with a person retained temporarily or released temporarily from custody, a person who stands sponsor, or that it has some relationship between a yachtsman and his craft. It has now been made quite clear to us that this Amendment applies those terms in the way in which everyone has been discussing this question of "bailor" or "bailee" in considering this Bill, by which I mean ordinary terms. This Amendment applies those ordinary terms in a commonsense way to the application of this Bill to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lady the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir), in whose name the new Clause stands, was good enough to have a word with me about it. By reason of important duties elsewhere, she is not able to be with the Committee this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not quite sure what was in the mind of the hon. Lady and the other sponsors of this Bill. So far as I am concerned, I am much too well trained to dream of suggesting that any legislation should apply to Scotland unless it is suggested by Scotland itself. The hon. Member who has just spoken with such felicity suggested one ignoble possibility—that hon. Members may have thought that no Scotsman would ever leave any goods uncollected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am bound to say, since the hon. Gentleman has referred to it, that the thought occurred to my mind, although I have not communicated it to anybody, but now that the hon. Gentleman says that it does happen in Scotland, I can only assume that it is in the case of those Scotsmen who, between the time when they deposited the goods and the time when normally they would have collected them, took what Doctor Johnson described as the noblest course ever open to Scotsmen—the high road to England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very glad that Scotland is to be included in the province of the Bill. My hon. Friend who moved this new Clause in the absence of the noble Lady referred to a difference of terminology which no doubt will bring gratification to the heart of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Portsmouth, West (Brigadier Clarke). I assure him that the terms used in Scottish law are far more complex than those used in English law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also gently take my hon. and gallant Friend to task for his very ungenerous reference to the legal profession? It is a little difficult to understand why my hon. and gallant Friend should think that, although he would not suggest that dentistry should be dealt with other than by dentists or medicine other than by doctors, legal matters may be dealt with by people other than lawyers. I can only suppose it comes from his participation in a profession which is unique in that when the real business of his profession comes to be dealt with,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1951-1952V000P0I0705">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir L.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am myself in some confusion about this, as I am sure is everybody else, because we have had comparatively little time in which to study the new Clause, and I should therefore be glad if the matter could be cleared up. The Parliamentary Secretary disagreed with me when I suggested that charges only became payable in the event of a sale, and I accepted it at once from him that I was wrong in that statement. I would explain what my difficulty is, and I have looked at the new Clause again since the Parliamentary Secretary made his observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (2)—page 1063—the words used are,
	<br><blockquote><p>"References in this Act to the charges of the bailee"</p></blockquote>
and so on, but that subsection is governed by the opening words of what is a purely definition Clause. There is nothing there which, of itself, enables and authorises the charge to be made. It is a definition Clause, and not a charging Clause, and, therefore, one cannot refer to that Clause as an authority for saying that the bailee is entitled to charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much obliged, and I would not have raised the matter in this way had it not been for the rather rushed way in which we are having to deal with this new Clause. I am merely raising the matter for consideration in the hope of receiving an explanation of my difficulty, and I hope that will be for the convenience of everybody in the Committee, and in order that the matter might be cleared up by the time the Bill reaches Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with the reference to page 1063. Now I come to page 1062, to the previous new Clause, where we find the words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) Where goods are sold by virtue of the provisions of this Act, any amount by which the gross proceeds of the sale exceed the charges of the bailee in relation to the goods shall be recoverable by the bailor from the bailee and any amount by which the said charges exceed the gross proceeds of the sale shall be recoverable by the bailee from the bailor."</p></blockquote>
This is an authentic charging Clause which authorises a charge to be made, as distinct from the new Clause on page 1063, but that charging provision merely arises where the goods are sold, and not before the goods are sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may now return to my previous reference, on page 1061, subsection (6) of the first new Clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(6) A notice required or authorised by this section to be given by the bailee to the bailor must contain a sufficient description of the goods to which the notice relates and a statement of the sum which the bailee claims to be due to him by way of his charges in relation to the goods …"</p></blockquote>
I agree at once that that seems to contemplate that the bailee should have the power to charge, even though the goods have not been sold, but it does not itself authorise the charge to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am wondering whether, in fact, there is some gap in the Bill, and whether it is contemplated that there should be a charge by the bailee even where the goods have not been sold. There is no charging provision there. I agree that the most likely explanation is that I have overlooked the charging provision, but, although I have looked at it carefully in the short time available, I have not been able to find a charging provision except where the goods have been sold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

page 1063 it is stated that the bailee having instructed the bailor that the goods were ready for acceptance by the bailor, it was only from that date that a charge could be made for storage. I think that is quite clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
