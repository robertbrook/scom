CLAUSE 1.</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
—(Power of borough council to vary existing provisions as to audit.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. PETHERICK</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 33, after the word "effect," to insert the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"in the case of a resolution adopting the provisions of Sub-section (1) of this Section."</p></blockquote>
This is the first of several Amendments standing in my name. If hon. Members will turn to Sub-section (4) they will find it stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any resolution passed and confirmed for the purposes of this Section shall take effect as from such date as the Minister of Health may by order direct."</p></blockquote>
If a municipal corporation should adopt the district audit it is only right that the Minister of Health, who is the responsible Minister, should be able to decide when the district audit staff shall be available for such audit, but that consideration would not apply, of course, in the case of a professional audit. The Ministry has no direct interest in when a professional audit should start.</span></p>
<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p>Further Amendment made: In page 2, line 34, at the end, add the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"and, in the case of a resolution adopting the provisions of Sub-section (2) of this Section, as from such date as may be specified in the resolution."—[<i>Mr. Petherick.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Motion made, and Question, "That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill," put, and agreed to.</p>

—(Short title.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. PETHERICK</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 36, at the end, to add the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"(2) This Act shall not extend to Scotland or Northern Ireland."</p></blockquote>
It is quite clear that this Bill does not extend to Scotland or Northern Ireland,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1002</span>
because the Municipal Corporations Act does not apply to either of those countries. Consequently, although it is entirely unnecessary to exempt the Bill from applying to Scotland or Northern Ireland it has been found advisable to include such a provision as this for the sake of clarity when anyone is looking up the Bill on a future occasion.</span></p>

NEW CLAUSE.</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
—(Inspection and copies of reports.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p>"Every burgess in a borough in which the provisions of Sub-section (1) or Sub-section (2) of Section one are adopted may at all reasonable times, without payment, inspect and take copies of and extracts from any report of the district auditor or other auditor or auditors thereunder appointed."—[<i>Mr. Storey.</i>]</p>
<p>Brought up, and read the First time.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. STOREY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br><br>
I must apologise to the promoter of the Bill for the fact that this new Clause should have appeared on the Order Paper only this morning, but it seeks to establish a right which is so elementary that I hope the Committee will find no difficulty in accepting it. I do not think any member of the Committee will deny that an elector should have the right of seeing the report on the accounts which is presented by the district auditor. At present the law on the matter is somewhat chaotic. Under the Local Government Act, 1894, electors in rural districts possess the right to inspect and take copies of any documents, but such right does not exist in urban areas, nor does the Municipal Corporation Act, 1882, give the power to a municipality. I think we ought to make it quite clear that any electors in municipalities have a right to inspect the auditor's report. Some time ago some of the Northern Members made representations to the Ministry of Health recommending that the district auditor's report should be available to electors. On that occasion the Minister replied that the omission of urban areas appeared to be largely accidental, and that what they proposed would be a matter for consideration in any future legislation. I therefore hope
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1932-1933V000P1I0502">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1003</span>
the Ministry will take this opportunity of making auditors' reports available to electors in municipalities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. PETHERICK</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I assure the hon. Member that the bringing forward of this new Clause at so late a date has been no cause of embarrassment, because I had already considered this particular proposal very carefully and had gone into the whole situation. I am inclined to think that there are certain difficulties in the way of accepting the Clause. I quite agree that the present position is more or less indefensible. Ratepayers in urban districts ought to have the same right of access to the accounts, and, indeed, be allowed to obtain copies, as they have in the case of rural districts. At the same time, according to the information I have received, it is rather doubtful whether it is possible or advisable to include such a stipulation in this particular Bill. As the hon. Member says, it is really more a case for subsequent legislation, although, perhaps he did not mean to make that point, and would like a precedent to be created here. I myself do not think it is a matter to be included in this particular Bill. It is certainly a very important matter, and from conversations which I have had with the Ministry I understand they feel that it will be only right to give it very serious consideration when the question of the consolidation of local government law comes to be discussed. I regret that in this case I cannot accept the Clause, but I have the assurance of my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health that the matter will receive consideration when any subsequent legislation is under discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MICHAEL BEAUMONT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I very much regret the speech of the hon. Member for Penryn and Falmouth (Mr. Petherick) because I do not think, frankly, that he made out any case against the proposed new Clause. He suggested that it should be postponed until the consolidation of local government law was undertaken, and that may be tantamount to saying that it should be postponed <i>sine die.</i> That is one of the things for which we have been waiting for a very long time. I cannot see that this Clause would in any way
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1004</span>
adversely affect the Bill. It is quite true that if consolidating legislation were about to be undertaken the change would be better made in that way, but it seems to be a change that ought to be made, and I think that this is an opportunity for it, and unless far more cogent reasons are advanced against it I shall be compelled to support the Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir BASIL PETO</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to support the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Beaumont). The only argument against conferring this right upon the electors is that possibly, at some future date, it may be included in a consolidating Measure, but if it is in this Bill it will still go into the consolidating Measure, and we may as well make sure of it now.</span></p>
<p>Question, "That the Clause be read a Second time," put, and agreed to.</p>
<p>Clause added to the Bill.</p>

SCHEDULE.</div> <!-- schedule -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
—(Alternative provisions which may be adopted as to auditors.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. PETHERICK</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 10, at the end, to insert the words "in England and Wales."<br><br>
The object of this Amendment is simply to insert the proper title of a very eminent body of accountants, whose correct title is "The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales."</span></p>
<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. PETHERICK</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 11, at the end, to insert the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Society of Accountants in Edinburgh,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The Institute of Accountants and Actuaries in Glasgow;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The Society of Accountants in Aberdeen."</p></blockquote>
The object of this Amendment is to add the names of three very ancient and very honourable bodies of accountants in Scotland. As the Bill was framed the only four bodies of accountants named in the Schedule happened to be English accountants. The reason why those four were selected was that their names had appeared in previous Acts dealing with local government. There was no intention to cast any slight on Scottish auditors. When the question of including Scottish auditors was brought up on Second Reading, I said I would give it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1932-1933V000P1I0503">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1005</span>
favourable consideration. I understand that there is nothing to prevent English professional auditors, if they can get any business, from working for corporations in Scotland, and I cannot believe that Hadrian, when he built his wall, really had in mind an incursion of Pictish and Scottish auditors. I think this is an Amendment which should certainly be accepted by the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir B. PETO</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems a little strange that just after the hon. Member has carried an Amendment to say that the Bill shall not extend to Scotland or Northern Ireland he should bring forward an Amendment providing that bodies of Scottish auditors shall be competent to audit English accounts. Surely there is already enough competition among the members of the four very eminent bodies of accountants named in the Bill, and it is a little unnecessary to open this line of business to auditors from over the border.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTRY of HEALTH (Mr. Shakespeare)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Committee will accept this Amendment, because, although there is some point in what the hon. Baronet said, he will realise the difficulty there may be in the case of an old established firm in this country one of whose partners is a Scotsman and a member of one of these ancient bodies in Scotland. He may be a member of a firm practising in London, he may be almost naturalised in England, as it were, and yet he would be unable to accept an appointment to audit the accounts of a local authority. I understand that the Scottish people return the courtesy to us, and that is the basis on which I ask the Committee to accept this Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir B. PETO</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to make any bad blood between the two countries.</span></p>
<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. HERBERT WILLIAMS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 11, at the end, to insert the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Institution of Certified Public Accountants."</p></blockquote>
I have put down this Amendment at the request of my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Sir J. Ganzoni), who is not a Member of the Committee and is therefore unable to raise the matter himself. I think I can best
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1006</span>
explain the case by reading a letter which he has received from a constituent, who writes:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have been since 1916 an elective auditor of our borough. I note under the provisions of the Municipal Corporations Audit Bill appointments as auditor would be subject to membership in four accountancy bodies. I have been since 1907 in public practice and a Fellow of the Central Association of Accountants (Incorporated). Recently this Association has amalgamated with the Institution of Certified Public Accountants and I am a Fellow of the new body. Neither of the above are included in the schedule to the Bill, although the Institution of Certified Public Accountants is third in point of seniority in England.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>I might add that in addition to being an elective auditor of the borough, the council appointed me some years ago as internal auditor with wide powers of investigation in any department, and, further, I am also auditor of the Road Fund Licences under the Ministry of Transport.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>If the Bill is passed without amendment I should be ineligible for appointment to carry out work in which I have for many years given complete satisfaction."</p></blockquote>
I do not say that this letter makes out a case for this Amendment, but there is a case for some consideration of the way in which accountants should be defined for the purposes of this Bill. I understand that under the Income Tax Acts there is a wide and general provision for employing accountants which does not specify in detail which bodies are approved of. The provision is of such a character that anybody who is a qualified and competent accountant can act for that purpose. If the hon. Member in charge of the Bill asks us not to accept the Amendment I would appeal to him to consider, between now and the Report stage, whether the Schedule cannot be revised so that we may not be tied for all time to a specified list of bodies, and that any fully qualified person shall be able to act as an auditor. There might come a time in the future when a body was set up with qualifications which were perfectly satisfactory, but the members of it would not be able to act unless an amending Bill were passed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. PETHERICK</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have considered the question of the inclusion of other bodies of auditors but the position is that the societies mentioned in the Schedule are the only societies, so far, which have obtained recognition in previous Acts. I understand that another society some time ago raised a protest against their non-inclusion. Their case
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1932-1933V000P1I0504">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1007</span>
was carefully considered, and they were not accepted. It is obvious, in a Schedule of this kind, that you have to draw the line somewhere. It is necessary to go into the matter carefully and only add a name to the Schedule in a case where the society has indisputably proved its case. I can assure the hon. Member that I am prepared to consider between now and Report whether it is possible to add the society he has mentioned to the Schedule, but I understand that they have not yet applied for inclusion. Let me quote in this connection the decision of the Local Legislation Committee in the case of the Ossett Corporation Bill:
<br><blockquote><p>"In announcing the decision of the Committee, the Chairman said that they were not prepared to give an absolutely unlimited power to any corporation to have an audit by any person whom they thought fit to select. There must be a standard of some sort."</p></blockquote>
That is the case; but I am prepared to look into the matter between now and Report and see whether it is possible to include this society in the Schedule, although I cannot hold out any certain hope that I shall be able to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. WILLIAMS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the undertaking given by the hon. Member that he will examine the situation and see if it can be met by some general form of words, I ask leave to withdraw the Amendment. I realise that there may be institutions which should not be included because their standard is not good enough but, on the other hand, there may be individual members who are entitled to carry on their work, and perhaps he will consult with the Parliamentary Secretary and see whether some general form of words can be found instead of specifying individual organisations.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p><i>The following Amendment stood upon the Paper in the name of</i> Mr. MAGNAY:</p>
<p>In page 3, line 13, at the end, to insert the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"The British Association of Accountants and Auditors, Limited."</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MAGNAY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of what has just transpired, and in view of the undertaking which has just been given by the promoters of the Bill, I do not propose to move this Amendment. The assurance that has been given on this matter is quite good enough for me. I have in my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1008</span>
possession letters from qualified accountants who will be out of work immediately this Bill is passed. That would be a grave hardship. I have the case of one man who succeeded to the practice of a chartered accountant, and who now has a partner, but although he has done this work for years he does not come within the four corners of the Bill as it is now drafted; and he would suffer a grave hardship. I am sure it is not the wish of the Committee that any hardship should be inflicted by the Bill, and I am glad to have had the assurance that the matter will be further considered. It satisfies my requirements.</span></p>
<p>Motion made and Question, "That this, as amended, be the Schedule to the Bill," put; and agreed to.</p>
<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Bill, as amended, be reported to the House."</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir WILLIAM RAY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not know until yesterday that I was on the Committee, otherwise I should have put down an Amendment on the Paper to test a somewhat big issue; but I wonder whether I can mention it now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir W. RAY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel that the Committee is being asked to take a serious step indeed in regard to the audit of municipal accounts, and the matter which I desire to raise is one of growing interest to ratepayers in all districts, but chiefly in industrial districts. As the Committee knows, the Local Government Consolidation Committee have issued an interim report in which they refer to the question of accounts and audit. They say:
<br><blockquote><p>"The recently issued report of the Committee on Local Expenditure recommends, though the recommendation is not unanimous, that the accounts of municipal corporations should be subject to district audit. We are satisfied, however, that whether or not the assimilation of the law by abolishing municipal audit and making borough councils subject to district audit would be desirable, such a course would raise controversial issues and is outside our terms of reference. The draft Bill, accordingly, maintains without alteration the existing law on the matter."</p></blockquote>
They published the draft Bill, and it is clearly set out there the existing powers in regard to the audit of local accounts. This Measure is for the purpose of abolishing the elective auditor,

with which I think we are all in agreement, and allow local authorities to appoint professional auditors. It is an extraordinary thing that county councils, district councils, and urban councils, should be subject to one type of audit while municipal corporations are subject to another type of audit. While I fully agree that professional accountants and auditors should be called in I think that before the Bill is ordered to be reported to the House consideration should be given to the question as to whether the powers now given to district auditors should, if possible, be given to professional auditors. It is wrong that I or any other hon. Member who may be serving on a county council, or a district council or an urban council, may be surcharged by an auditor because we have done something wrong

but that the same policy is not to be applied to municipal corporations. It does not seem fair that some of us who are engaged in local government should be liable to all sorts of pains and penalties—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I must tell the hon. Member that we cannot have a Second Reading speech at this stage. He has adumbrated his point to the Committee, but I think that with the permission of the Committee I must now put the Question: "That the Bill as amended be reported to the House."</span></p>
<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>
<p>Bill, as amended, ordered to be reported to the House.</p>
<p>Committee rose at Twenty Minutes before Twelve o'Clock.</p>
