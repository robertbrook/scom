<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendment No. 158.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 39(6)(b) amends the statutory definition of "life or endowment business" carried on by friendly societies, removing the prohibition on tax-exempt sickness benefit business carried on by new societies. From now on, they will be allowed to write such business, but if any policy is surrendered it will lose its qualifying status, so that any gain taken at that time will be subject to an income tax charge.<br><br>
In proposing this relaxation we had in mind a common type of mixed-benefit contract providing both life and health assurance. But the friendly societies liaison committee has pointed out to us that the legislation as drafted might weaken our defences against a tax avoidance device by means of bogus sickness benefit schemes which contain no element of true mutual assurance. It might therefore be exploited by the new societies, but the amendments are designed to block that potential loophole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not need to say much about these two amendments. We accept that they are designed simply to block a potential loophole, and we are happy to accept them on that basis.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made</i>: No. 158, in page 40, line 3, leave out from "1974" to end of line 4 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"and (bb) for paragraph (a) of subsection (2) there shall be substituted—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"(a) shall not include the issue of a policy affording provision for sickness or other infirmity (whether bodily or mental) unless—
<ol>
<li>it also affords assurance for a gross sum independent of sickness or other infirmity; and</li>
<li>not less than sixty per cent. of the amount of the premiums is attributable to the provision afforded during sickness or other infirmity; and</li>

FRIENDLY SOCIETIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 159, in page 115, line 2, after "death" insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"or only on death occurring after the attainment of a specified age not exceeding sixteen".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 160 and 162 and amendment No. 151, in page 115, line 40, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(d) reference to a capital sum payable on death or on death before the end of a specified term shall include a capital sum so payable on death occurring after the attainment of a specified age not exceeding 16 and the policy must not provide for the payment in the event of death before that age of an amount exceeding the total premiums previously paid thereunder.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government amendments deal with the same point as amendment No. 151. I am advised that, although amendment No. 151 might achieve the desired result, it is drafted in a way that is not entirely consistent with the rest of the legislation. I make no complaint about that; it is the point that is raised that matters, rather than the precise wording. The wording that I am commending to the Committee is rather longer, but it is more certain and exact, and I hope that the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) will be content with that.<br><br>
The amendments concern the new statutory test for qualifying life assurance policies issued by tax-exempt friendly societies which requires the minimum sum assured to be at least 75 per cent. of the total premiums payable. Then amendments are needed because many policies that have been issued by the traditional societies on children's lives provide only for a return of total premiums if the child dies before the age of 16. Therefore, the policies would not satisfy the test as now drafted. The effect of the amendments would be to produce a let-out for those bona fide policies. The question is technical and simply relates to how many premiums must be counted in the calculation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right in saying that the Government amendments meet our suggestion in amendment No. 151. Therefore, I shall not press amendment No. 151 so that the Government amendments stand alone. The Government amendments do what is required by allowing the death benefit for juvenile policies to be exempted from the 75 per cent. rule. We are happy with the way in which the Government have expressed that requirement in their amendments.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made</i>: No. 160, in page 115, line 11, after "disability", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(including a policy securing the sum on death only if occurring after the attainment of a specified age not exceeding sixteen)".</p></blockquote></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 161, in page 115, line 30, leave out from "annually" to end of line 32 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"and the policy is issued by a new Society, there shall be disregarded an amount equal to 10 percent. of those premiums;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(ia) where the policy is issued by a society other than a new society. there shall be disregarded an amount equal to £ 10 for each year for which account is taken of those premiums; and".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:<br><br>
No. 150, in page 115, line 35, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(iv) so much of any premium as is charged as a policy fee shall be disregarded.".</p></blockquote>
and Government amendment No. 164.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government amendments cover the same purpose as Opposition amendment No. 150. 1 shall therefore briefly explain the purpose of the amendments.<br><br>
The amendments relate to another aspect of the 75 per cent. test. In calculating the total premiums payable for purposes of the test, a proportion can be disregarded where premiums are payable more often than once it year because such premiums often contain a loading charge to recoup the higher administration costs of dealing with monthly or weekly payments. As the new test is currently drafted, the amount of disregard is 7.5 per cent. of the premiums.<br><br>
The friendly societies liaison committee pointed out to us that many of the traditional societies—those formed before 1966—charge a flat rate fee, which can be as much as £9.60 per annum irrespective of the sum assured, because that amount is needed to cover the societies' administrative costs for such policies. Therefore, many policies with relatively small sums assured would not satisfy the 75 per cent. test as now drafted.<br><br>
The amendments meet that point by providing that where a policy is issued by a traditional society, a flat rate amount of £10 can be disregarded for the purpose of the test. For policies issued by the new societies the amendments also increase, the percentage of the premiums which call be disregarded, if paid other than annually, from 7.5 per cent. to 10 per cent. The purpose of that is the same as the disregard for industrial business, and it seems sensible to bring those two into line. The more important amendment from the traditional friendly societies is amendment No. 164, which provides a £10 disregard. As I understand it, that should cover any problems which they have with their policies.<br><br>
Amendment No. 150 would solve the problem. but it would create other difficulties. In particular, it would present an invitation to the commercial societies—the new societies—to circumvent the limits by charging inflated policy fees. These would not be needed to meet the administration costs because those societies are efficient bodies and they have no overheads. Instead, they could he invested on behalf of the policyholder and they would boost the tax-free returns. They would be a way of giving the new societies an unfair advantage which is not intended. For that reason, I ask the Committee to support amendments Nos. 161 and 164 rather than amendment No. 150.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 312</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not press amendment No. 150 because, after consultation with the friendly societies liaison committee, I accept that Government amendments Nos. 161 and 164 will ensure that the sums insured of £750 or less pass the 75 per cent. rule provided that the policy fee is not taken into account as usual.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 149, in page 115, line 35, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(iii) so much of any premium as is charged for sickness or unemployment benefit shall be disregarded.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment refers to combination policies when life assurances are combined with sickness or unemployment benefit. The common death benefit is about 10 days' sick or unemployment pay, and the part of the total premium payable to the life assurance is consequently small. It is inevitable that such a typical benefit offered by many small friendly societies would fail the 75 per cent. test. Such contracts might still be issued but would be non-qualifying policies within the tax exempt fund.<br><br>
When LAPR was withdrawn in the 1984 Budget, the corresponding allowance for one half of the premium attributable to life assurance for combined contracts for income tax purposes was not also withdrawn. We are talking about very small amounts. Because the member must claim for the allowance in his income tax returns, the take-up rate will not be 100 per cent.<br><br>
The liaison committee of the friendly societies feels that the allowance could vanish inadvertently, and that is the reason for the proposed amendment.</span></p>
<p>9 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has raised an interesting topic, but amendment No. 163 achieves the point about LAPR on part premiums and I shall have a word to say about that later.<br><br>
On amendment No. 149, it is accepted that because of the way in which the 75 per cent. test works, some mixed-benefit policies would not satisfy the qualifying conditions. But that is likely to give rise to hypothetical problems only. If such a policy is non-qualifying, the only practical effect would be that on the occurrence of a chargeable event, any gains derived by the policy holder would be liable to income tax.<br><br>
The payment of sickness benefit is not a chargeable event, and so that would not trigger a problem. The surrender of a mixed benefit policy would be a chargeable event, but in those circumstances any such policy issued by a traditional society carrying on a bona fide sickness benefit business is unlikely to have a surrender value in excess of the return on premiums paid. Therefore it is a hypothetical problem, but we will keep an eye on it. We have discussed it with the friendly societies liaison committee, and it appears to be satisfied by the exchange of views that has taken place and I do not think that an amendment is necessary to deal with the point embodied in amendment No. 149.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 313</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made</i>: No. 162, in page 115, line 40, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(5A) If the policy does not secure a capital sum in the event of death occurring before the age of sixteen or some lower age, it must not provide for the payment in that event of an amount exceeding the total premiums previously paid under it.".—[<i>Mr. Ian Stewart.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 152, in page 116, line 15, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(8) The Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies shall not register premium rates failing the requirements of sub-paragraphs (2) to (7) above, but all contracts issued at registered rates shall be deemed to meet those requirements."</p></blockquote>
Without a 75 per cent. rule there has been no relationship for qualifying policies between the sum assured, subject to statutory limit, and the premium payable for that sum assured. Nevertheless the registrar of friendly societies has resisted registering premium rates for societies which breach the 75 per cent. rule where contracts were designed that allowed the maximum payment into tax-exempt funds. Without doing so, there would have been no limit to the tax avoidance possible.<br><br>
The friendly societies accept that a statutory authority for a 75 per cent. rule is desirable but believe that the opportunity should be taken to build on the requirement of societies to register their premium rates and to avoid the possibility of the large number of societies operating with limited resources applying the rule inadequately. This can be done by testing the rates at the time they are registered and by accepting that policies issued at registered rates pass the test. The amendment asks instead that the registrar of friendly societies should examine each case on its merits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has described a problem which has arisen with many additional societies basing their policies on their existing premium tables. The amendment will help those societies by providing that the new test does not apply to them until they revise their premium tables for whatever reason. Such tables, of course, have to be registered by the chief registrar.<br><br>
I fully accept in principle that there is a problem and that some form of transitional arrangement is necessary. The problem was not foreseen and we should deal with it, but for reasons which I shall come to in a moment, I do not favour open-ended arrangements of the sort which the amendment would achieve. It could be many years before a society sought to re-register its premium tables if it had no incentive to do so, which would leave a very untidy, extended period. Societies should have a further period in which to get the position straight, and will therefore be allowed a period of grace in which to register their premium tables. The period will run to the end of this year, 31 December 1985.<br><br>
In the meantime, societies will be able to continue selling policies based on their existing tables, but any contract made after 31 December 1985 will have to satisfy the 75 per cent. test. If they have any problems
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 314</span>
with that, they can consult the friendly society liaison committee or the Inland Revenue, and I am sure that they will get any assistance which was needed to enable them to register new tables.<br><br>
I have suggested that registration should be done by a concessionary practice rather than an amendment, for a number of reasons. First the concession will be short-lived.<br><br>
It is hardly necessary to place it on the statute book for a transitional period. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it would create flexibility, so that if a society missed the deadline by a few days, it would be given indulgence. It would not be fixed to a particular date by statute. There obviously has to be a date—the period cannot run on for ever—but as soon as a date is put in leglistion, flexibility will be lost and societies may just miss the deadline by a short period.<br><br>
Thirdly, the concessionary method would make it easier to guard against possible abuse by the new societies which have already registered new tables. They might try to change them back for the transitional period in order to circumvent the rules and gain an unfair advantage over the traditional societies, which I think none of us would want.<br><br>
It seems better on the whole to deal with this very temporary problem by concessionary practice and to allow transitional arrangements to last until the end of the year. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Lady. It certainly seems acceptable to all the friendly societies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's remarks, I think that concessionary practice will be entirely acceptable to the Opposition and to the friendly society liaison committee. I take the Minister's point about building into statute a transitional period of which the new societies could take unfair advantage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 163, in page 116, line 17, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) In determining whether a policy—
<ol>
<li>which affords provision for sickness or other infirmity (whether bodily or mental). and</li>
<li>which also affords assurance for a gross sum independent of sickness or other infirmity, and</li>
<li>under which not less than sixty per cent. of the amount of the premiums is attributable to the provision referred to in paragraph (a) above.</li></ol>
is a qualifying policy. the condition referred to in paragraph 3(1)(b) above shall he deemed to be fulfilled with respect to it.".</p></blockquote>
This is a relieving amendment, whose purpose I shall explain briefly. Although life assurance relief was generally withdrawn in last year's Budget, it was retained for part payments to friendly societies in respect of mixed benefit policies, which normally provide a mixture of superannuation, death and sickness benefits. It is the element of the premium which is attributable to death cover which attracts that relief.<br><br>
It is quite likely that many of those mixed benefit policies would not be able to satisfy the new statutory test, which requires the minimum sum assured to be at least 75 per cent. of the total premiums. As the provisions are drafted, that means that the policies
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0698">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 315</span>
involved would lose the benefit of premium relief, which is certainly not our intention. The amendment would rectify that by providing that mixed-benefit policies are treated as though the test is satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We appreciate that Government amendment No. 163 is designed to meet some of the problems faced by mixed-benefit policyholders. We accept it.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made</i>: No. 164, in page 117, line 13, after 'paragraphs', insert `3(1)(b)'.—[<i>Mr Ian Stewart.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Eighth Schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I use this opportunity to mention a letter that I received in mid-February from the Independent Order of Odd Fellows Manchester Unity Friendly Society? Last year we discussed the 62.5 per cent. reduction in the tax exemption limit for branch friendly societies. The society requested a meeting earlier this year with the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss the implications of last year's Budget change.<br><br>
In what the society calls the summing-up of its position, it asks that
<br><blockquote><p>"the 1985 Finance Bill restores the former £2,000 tax-free limit to pre-1966 Branch and Order Friendly Societies. We ask this as a non-profit making and philanthropic organisation that needs an economic limit even to exist and cope with the ever rising costs of running our 1,400 local branches."</p></blockquote>
It also requests that
<br><blockquote><p>"the Government in equity, restores some parity with the rights enjoyed by trade union members who have a tax-free limit of £2,400 for their beneficial activities."</p></blockquote>
The society was most aggrieved by last year's decision. I shall not recite again the arguments that were so admirably deployed then by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr Davis), who went into the subject in great depth. However, I should like to know why the Chancellor refused to meet representatives of the society earlier this year and whether there has been further consideration inside the Treasury of the case which it put.<br><br>
In a long letter - which I shall not read to the committee in full as that would delay us unnecessarily -the society sets out in much detail why it believes that the legislative position prevailing before last year's Budget should be reconsidered.<br><br>
Perhaps in his reply the Ministry will address himself to the society's correspondence, its frustration and its proposals.</span></p>
<p>9.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Order of Odd fellows has written to many hon. Gentlemen about this matter; indeed, I have corresponded with the society. Last year I met its representatives and discussed a number of points with them in great detail.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 316</span>
Nothing much has changed since then; there is no need to repeat the arguments. Although powerful representations on the subject were made by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr Davis) and other Opposition Members last year about the potential effect of the change in limits, the impact on friendly societies has not been substantial, as far as I can tell.<br><br>
Obviously it is too early to have figures for the effect on business and so on, because it takes time for information to be collected. It is not our job to put friendly societies out of business, as the hon. Gentlemen knows.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In so far as the Ministry has no information about whether friendly societies have been damaged, will he keep a watching eye on these matters in the coming 12 months before the next Finance Bill, and in the event that there is evidence of substantial damage, will he consider next year reverting to the original position, because it is he who has advised the Committee of the need to take account of any difficulties that might arise for the societies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had allowed me to finish, I was about to say that the Government have no intention of applying a fiscal system to friendly societies which would force them out of business. That was not our intention last year, and it is not our intention now. It is early to judge the specific impact, but none of the evidence available to me suggests that the changes have had the impact the hon. Member for Hodge Hill feared.<br><br>
The nature of our proposals in the Friendly Societies Act 1984, and in the clause and the schedule to the Bill, shows that we are alert to the needs of friendly societies that all their proposals on the new provisions should carefully taken into account, and we have been able to meet most of them by Government amendments.<br><br>
I cannot give the hon. Member for Workington an assurance that we will change those limits. I can say that the framework of the friendly societies, as with all financial institutions, is kept under general review. The amount of further provision to be made for friendly societies shows that we are alive to their concerns. I have written to Mr. Henry with a number of more detailed comments on the points that he raised, but I will not give them to the Committee now. The general business of friendly societies, which is not like business as we understand it but is often sickness and other types of provident benefit, is not affected by change in the taxable limit. That is the bulk of their business.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman quoted from the letter a point about trade unions. They are not competing with the life assurance industry in any of its forms. They cannot be exploited commercially and people do not join them for financial purposes, so there is not exact correlation between arrangements for trade unions and those for friendly societies. I have taken not of Mr. Henry's point in his letter. We and the chief registrar keep an eye on the progress of friendly societies. There is nothing that persuades me that it would be right or necessary to alter the limiter now.</span></p>

attention to the fact that the Government do not wish to damage friendly societies. Those are his words, and when <i>Hansard</i> is published tomorrow I am sure that we will read them as the words that he deployed.<br><br>
If what he said is so, in the event that the societies can prove that the Government have incurred damage, will he reconsider the position? If the Government do not intend to impose damage, and the societies prove damage, surely the Minister cannot then turn a blind eye to it. He must be consistent. I merely ask that, if it can be proved that damage arises from the introduction of last year's changes, he will reconsider the position. That is a modest request.</span></p>

BUSINESS ENTERTAINING EXPENSES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>On proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Hodge Hill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a short clause but it attracts my interest. I should be grateful if one of the Ministers would explain it to us. The clause is headed "Business entertaining expenses", but it appears to be about gifts. I sould like to know what gifts are called "business entertaining expenses" and what is the cost of the increase from £2 to £10.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be delighted to explain. A not dissimilar question was imagined to have been asked in a Committee sitting in 1971. I start by referring to what my right hon. Friend who is now the Secretary of State for the Environment said in 1971 when he introduced the revaluation of this particular section of the Taxes Act from £1 to £2. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The clause has a misleading title."</p></blockquote>
He was right. It is misleading, so I shall first explain briefly what the clause seeks to do and then answer the point about cost.<br><br>
Section 411 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 disallows expenditure on business entertaining and gifts—that followed from the initial Act brought in by the Labour Government in 1965—as a deduction in computing profits for tax except for overseas trade customers. However since the legislation was first introduced in 1965, there has been an exception for small trade gifts below a de minimus limit. That exception was introduced by the Labour Government in 1965. The exception was intended to cover free samples and other promotional materials and small gifts such as calendars, diaries, pens, etcetera, bearing the donor's name or busines logo which are given to established customers, especially at Christmas. The limit was orginally set at £1 in 1965 and was increased to £2 in 1971—I referred to that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 318</span>
Committee debate—and is being raised to £10, which will simply restore the value of the limit broadly in line with inflation. The cost is negligible, which puts it underneath our ability to determine the cost.<br><br>
The relevant section of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 describes precisely the nature and the constraints surrounding the limitation introduced by the Labour Government in 1965. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"an article incorporating a conspicuous advertisement for the donor, being an article—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(a) which is not food, drink, tobacco or a token or voucher exchangeable for goods…"</p></blockquote>
The second paragraph contains a description of the cost that was at that stage increased for £1 to £2.<br><br>
The original exception was introduced by the Labour Government in 1965 in response to pressures from the printing and publishing trade because it saw it as part of its legitimate promotional business. The exception was to a very restrictive provision introduced to control business entertaining expenses other than for customers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How do the Government know that the cost is negligible? Surely they must have some measure of what it costs at present. We had a definition of "slight" during an earlier debate—it means less than £2 million. What does "negligible" mean? Is the list of gifts definitive? The Financial Secretary referred to a debate which took place in 1971 and to the speech made by his right hon. Friend who is now Secretary of State for the Environment. I was interested to read in the report of that debate that the Secretary of State omitted ash trays, which his right hon. Friend included in the list. What can be given as a gift? We know that tobacco, food and drink cannot—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith<span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Diaries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not hear what the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) said. If the hon. Gentleman would care to speak from a standing position—this is after all a Standing Committee—I should be delighted to listen to what he has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an intervention, is it not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wishes to intervene, he should do so standing up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Committee will be aware of my views about seated interventions. Hon. Members may get away with the odd one or two but after that, no.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious for enlightenment, and the hon. Gentleman to have some experience. I declare an interest and confess that I have been on the receiving end of some of these things in business. I never realised that the taxpayer was helping to pay for those diaries, calendars and pens—I think that pens were included in the list which the Financial Secretary gave us. However, what is the logic behind his list? Is there nothing else? He used the very loose word "etcetera". What else is included under that word? Surely he must have some idea of the cost. What is the logic behind the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0700">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 319</span>
list? Why are some things included and not others? If it is so reasonable to increase it from £2 to £10 in 1985, why have the Government not increased it since 1979? Why this year and why such a big increase?<br><br>
After listening to the Financial Secretary, I should have thought that it would have been an annual event and that we would be asked to increase it in line with inflation every year or perhaps every couple of years. What has suddenly produced this clause in this Bill this year?<br><br>
That was an intervention, Miss Fookes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will try to address myself to some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis). It is always a matter for debate as to how one defines what is negligible. I seem to recall the hon. Member for Hodge Hill asking me precisely the same question at some stage at night during last year's proceedings. I also seem to remember that I did not have the brief with me at that time but that I defined the sum to the Committee in Revenue terms as less than £1 million. I believe that that was the precise, normal nomenclature referred to for "negligible".<br><br>
I accept that it is extremely difficult in such areas to establish the precise Revenue cost. This is the best estimate that the Revenue can give and, obviously, it is on that basis that I give it to the Committee.<br><br>
The prescription of the list was introduced by the Labour Government to seek to help the very kind of small businesses that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) referred to in the debate in the House on the printing and publishing industry. The attempt was to try to ensure that genuine business promotion advertising was assisted. I could go a little further into the list but the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) is dying to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just on this point, because I hope to catch your eye later, Miss Fookes.<br><br>
The notes on clauses say that the gifts must incorporate an advertisement for the donor and must not consist of food. If they do not incorporate an advertisement, may I correctly assume that while they have been given by companies they do not attract tax relief? If they do not incorporate an advertisement vet are given in exactly the same way, would they not attract tax relief? Is that the position'?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I referred carefully to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 definition of the prescribed nature not only of the gift but the amounts. Section 411(8) of that Act refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"a gift consisting of an articlee incorporating a conspicious advertisement"</p></blockquote>
not merely an advertisement but a conspicuous advertisement
<br><blockquote><p>"for the donor".</p></blockquote>
Apart from that, all it sought was to restrict
<br><blockquote><p>"food, drink. tobacco or a token or voucher exchangeable for goods".</p></blockquote>
I could go on extensively in trying to describe the list,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 320</span>
but, clearly, the limitations are prescribed in the statute, and not only that. Obviously, they are limited by the cash amount.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hodge Hill asked why now? Why not between 1965 and 1971, when Government looked at the nature of the statutes and sought to revalue? There has been some modest pressure from, if I recall, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Law Society of Scotland on this issue. Essentially, this has been a continuing process when the small trades concerned with this matter press the Government from time to time to seek to revalue. All the Government seek is to revalue by the rate of inflation,</span></p>
<p>9.30pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I bring two little experiences to this debate? When I was in business, I supplied a great number of business gifts to the trade and many of them were stationery items which we manufactured. Today, I telephoned the British Advertising Gift Distributors Association, and organisation called BAGDA, which I knew in its previous form in the 1970s and which has helped me in drawing the Ministers attention to several issues that I think that the Treasury has taken into account. I am told that 5 per cent. of all business gifts are over £10 in value. Half of the remaining number approximately 40 to 45 per cent.—are between £2 and £10 and the rest are under £2.<br><br>
Therefore, nearly 50 per cent. of all business gifts fall within the £2 to £10 mark, They will all attract relief if they carry a logo.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) says "No." Perhaps he would like to tell me where I am wrong, as the Minister told me that these articles were defined under corporation tax legislation, which provided that they attracted relief if they carried a logo of sufficient size.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Hon. Gentleman has overlooked the fact that that is not the only condition, and that food, drink and tobacco are exempted. One of the most popular gifts at Christmas is a bottle of Scotch. Even if that had a large logo printed on the label it would still not be allowable for tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: According to my information, that does not affect the majority of the trade, which is in hardware and not in drinks and food. In view of the secretary of BAGDA, whom I spoke to today, we are talking about a market of £200 million worth of products which are transferred in this way. Admittedly many of these products do not carry a logo, which is why I wonder why the hon. Gentleman intervened. Producers will simply put a logo on a product of up to £10 and find that they will then be able to establish tax relief. Was that taken into account when the calculation was done?<br><br>
If that is the case, and only one half of the £200 million is in hardware, as against in wines, spirits and foods, we might be looking at a revenue consequence of £30 million or £40 million—the corporation tax that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0701">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 321</span>
would otherwise be payable on gifts which, under new arrangements, will carry a logo simply to ensure that the donor can claim corporation tax relief. That is a substantial amount of money. The Minister must assure us that that will not happen and that people will not switch to adding a logo and then claim full relief because of the existence of higher limits. If he cannot do that, there is a danger that the proposal could be far more expensive to the Revenue than expected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to give the Minister time to reflect on the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). To be fair to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), he said not that most gifts consisted of bottles of whisky, but that the most popular was a bottle of whisky. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman speaks knowledgeably. A bottle of whisky may be more popular than a diary, calendar, pen or ashtray. I should like to know what thought the Government have given to the matter. It sounds as if they have given in to pressure from an important lobby of a particular section of the small business sector, without giving any thought to the logic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The BAGDA, which represents all these organisations, has never made any representations to the Treasury about raising the limit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I heard the Financial Secretary say that he had had representations from the trade, but I do not suppose that he is allowed to say who, apart from the Institute of Chartered Accountants, have been lobbying him. There should be some logic behind these lists.<br><br>
For example, it is illogical that it is wrong for a business to give a customer a packet of cigarettes advertising the company and bearing its logo yet if the company gives an ashtray, matches or a cigarette lighter, which will be covered by the £10 limit, the gift will be subsidised by the taxpayer. It does not seem to be in the public interest to encourage the distribution of glossy sexist calendars displaying the company's name yet not to subsidise the distribution of books—I shall not name my favourite author.<br><br>
I do not understand the logic of the provision. The gifts are not restricted to materials printed and published in this country. They can be produced abroad so that an overseas printer benefits.<br><br>
It is not good enough for the Government to say that they have listened to submissions from an unknown representative or representative body of a particular section of small business and to increase the limit from £2 to £10. I do not oppose the increase. I want to understand whether the Treasury has any logic. I begin to think that, again, there is no logic in the provision.<br><br>
Must the gift be an item? A company may decide to distribute tickets to a sporting event that it has sponsored. A company such as Canon may give out tickets to football matches in the Canon league.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether that is a good thing for the taxpayer to subsidise or whether it qualifies for tax relief. Perhaps the Minister will explain. Such a gift
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 322</span>
could be held to advertise a company's products.<br><br>
The Minister says that the provision is designed to help small businesses. He has confirmed that his definition is the same as it was in the early hours of the Finance Bill Comittee last year. To the Government, "negligible" means less than £1 million and under £2 million is "slight" Those are the small businesses that the Minister wants to help. We shall pursue that implication on other matters such as the production of Cyprus sherry by a well known co-operative producer.<br><br>
When I see Ministers I shall raise those sorts of figures as "negligible" and "slight" in terms of subsidies to businesses. We have had it from the Minister that that interpretation can be given from the representations received from small businesses. But why only some small businesses? Why exclude tobacco, drink and especially food? What about small restaurants?<br><br>
The clause is titled "Business entertaining expenses" so why not encourage business men to entertain their customers to breakfast at a charge of less than £10? Why should a business man not buy his customer a traditional breakfast on British Rail for £5.50 plus gratuity? That would fall within the £10 limit. I am a great admirer of British Rail breakfasts and it would be a good way of winning orders.<br><br>
You and I, Miss Fookes, remember the long hours of the Standing Committee on last year's Finance Bill. In the hot, early hours of the morning we were told about fiscal neutrality. We have not heard much of that cliche this year. I do not believe that the words "fiscal neutrality" have dropped from the lips of a Treasury Minister since Easter.<br><br>
I am puzzled. I thought that fiscal neutrality would be pursued year in, year out, Finance Bill after Finance Bill. I believed that fiscal neutrality was the name of the game and that last year was just the first instalment. But what is fiscally neutral about diaries, pens, glossy sexist calendars and ashtrays?<br><br>
I see no logic in the measure. I do not admire much about the Chancellor of the Exchequer but I thought that he was at least trying to be neutral and that he would not interfere and make value judgments about whether a diary was better than the Bible. But that is what he is doing because a gift must bear the company's logo.<br><br>
I question whether such gifts are of value to the economy. What about the tremendous waste of physcial resources? In the Houses of Parliament in the new year there are dozens of calendars — not sexist ones — diaries and even pens in waste paper baskets. We are inundated with them, all subsidised by the taxpayer.<br><br>
In business it was even worse. We could not raffle the gifts because there are too many so we distributed them round the office. I question whether such gifts are necessary and question the logic of them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Harry Cohen<span class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making some good points. Taxpayers subsidising advertising in this way is a serious matter and should be opposed. Taxpayers' money should be spent in better ways. Does my hon. Friend agree that what is happening here is subsidisation of advertising generally? Is there not something immoral in that? Saatchi and Saatchi are dead keen to keep the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0702">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 323</span>
Conservative party's advertising budget, so they might make sure that they give lots of gifts to Conservative Members of Parliament and Cabinet Ministers. So there is double immorality - the immorality of promoting the Conservative party, and getting tax relief for doing it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. friend tempts me to stray out of order but I shall not succumb.<br><br>
My hon Friend is somewhat mistaken. Advertising is a normal legitimate business expense, which is deducted in the calculation of profit. I see the logic in saying that if an item is advertising a company it would be classed as advertising, rather than as a gift. But that is different from business entertaining. Here we are dealing with "Business entertaining expenses". that is the title of the clause. If it was a diary, a pen or a calendar — like the ones we all see in garages; I always look at them when I collect my car — that is advertising a company's products, not a business entertaining expense.<br><br>
May I put a further point to the Financial Secretary, which I think he did not mention in his explanation of the clause. There is one other constraint on the tax relief. It is not a limit of £2 to be increased by this Government to £10 on an item: the limit is on the value of gifts that a business can give a customer or recipient.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An item.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So it is an item. I therefore withdraw the point. I understood that the restriction was on the recipient as well; one could give several items, but they should not add up to more than £10. If the Financial Secretary says that I am wrong. I shall accept what he says.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not read the relevant part. of the 1970 Act. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"the cost of which to the donor, taken together with the cost to him of any other such articles"—</p></blockquote>
so it does circumscribe in that respect—
<br><blockquote><p>"Given by him to that person in the same year, does not exceed £2".</p></blockquote>
So it is the item and the recipient, with the figure proposed to be £10.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Financial Secretary is now telling me is what I understood before. A business can give a customer items which add up to £10. No single item is to exceed £10. The restriction would not affect two calendars or two diaries. The business could give a diary, a calendar, an ashtray, a cigarette lighter and boxes of matches, provided that they did not amount to more than £ 10 to that recipient from that donor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>indicated assent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary nods, so I have understood correctly. What records are companies supposed to keep?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to cover as many of the points as I can. It was not the Chancellor who sought to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 324</span>
circumscribe this area with a moral code which, interestingly and amusingly, was introduced through "fiscal neutrality" and in other ways by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis). I shall go back to the beginning, although I had assumed that Opposition Members were aware of the legislation that they introduced, and of the reasons for it.<br><br>
9.45 pm<br><br>
The nature of the problem was an attempt by the then Labour Government in 1965—continued by successive Labour and Conservative Governments—to inhibit, contain and control what might be called "entertaining", so that a business could not legitimately claim an entertainment expense other than for an overseas customer.<br><br>
In the process of doing so, the Labour Government of 1965 were persuaded, essentially by the printing and publishing industry, that there were legitimate advertising promotional activities that were part and parcel of their business. I could go through the list of ashtrays and other items, and go into the details of numbers of gifts and firms involved in what is a substantial industry made up of small units. The Government were persuaded at the time to make a specific exception relating to business. The morality, or immorality, of having a moral code was therefore not developed by the present Chancellor, nor by a Conservative Government.<br><br>
It was determined in 1965 that the arrangment should be circumscribed in two essential respects: the first related to the nature of the product and what I might call moral decisions were made at the time about food, tobacco or vouchers that could effectively be exchanged for money. Secondly, a limit was imposed on the amount of money used for any recipient.<br><br>
The present Government, wisely or unwisely, have not sought to challenge that moral dilemma. The arrangement has continued and has not been challenged, even when the Government last sought. in 1971, to upvalue the cash limit in line with the rate of inflation. There may be room for further debates, or for a debate on the need for moral judgment. The Government are not seeking to enlarge an areas that might be called "entertaining" as opposed to promotional advertising.<br><br>
I cannot debate with the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) the data he has received and his own experience of the size of the industry concerned. All that I can say is that it has been suggested to me that his figures may be somewhat too large. If, however, we are wrong, and there has been a sizeable increase in such business activities we would have to come back to the Committee next year or some other year and admit that the figure had increased. There would be greater tax revenues, in consequence of increased business revenue.<br><br>
I recognise the need for debate. I apologise if I did not make it clear that this year the only pre-Budget representations that we received on the need for this revaluation came from the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Law Society of Scotland. In the past there have been regular representations from the trade associations representing calendar and diary manufacturers, campaigning for the limit to be increased in line with inflation.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 325</span>
I apologise to the hon. Member for Hodge Hill because I am leaving the area of "fiscal neutrality". But I am entering the area of absolute equity. I wrote down what he, rightly, said. He said that advertising is a normal business expense, and that all that the Government are seeking to do, within the context of the existing code, is to ensure that the revaluation—which I agree is somewhat outdated—is covered by an increase to £10, which reflects simply the effect of inflation.<br><br>
This is a modest step, and it acknowledges a legitimate business activity within a tightly circumscribed entertainments expenses limit. It excludes and would exclude the tickets referred to by the hon. Member for Hodge Hill. Those would be regarded as entertainment and would not come within the regulations.<br><br>
I hope that hon. Members will acknowledge that the provision offers some assistance to a large number of reasonably-sized British firms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has skilfully skirted around the important issue that I raised, that those companies will now put a logo on items costing up to £11. Earlier I quoted a figure of £30 million to £40 million but I had failed to take into account the fact that only half the gifts cost between £2 and £10, so I am now changing the figure for that potential revenue loss to between £15 million and £20 million in the current financial year, when the changes are to be made. It would be a perfectly legitimate business practice to stamp the company's name on an item and so ensure that the company retains corporation tax relief.<br><br>
The Minister is responsible for Treasury officials. Did his officials take the facts into account when they made their recommendations to him and submitted the representations from calendar and diary manufacturers? I maintain that they were remiss in not identifying the amount, because if I am right, it will prove that they were negligent, and the Minister is directly responsible for them.<br><br>
Between now and Report the Minister should examine what I have said and if there is any danger that the revenue loss could be between £15 million and £20 million at a time when many needy areas could make good use of that £20 million, he should consider deleting the clause on Report. I am well aware that it has implications for some visitors to the United Kingdom, but the Government defined their policy not on the basis of this measure of revenue loss, but on the basis of its being a negligible loss. Had the Government known that the potential for revenue loss was between £15 million and £20 million, they would never have put the clause in the Bill. That is why they should establish before Report whether there is any value in what I am saying. If the Government can prove that I am wrong, the measure should stay in the Bill, but if I am right, they must defend making such a tax concession which would be indefensible in current circumstances.<br><br>
I spoke to a representative of BAGDA this morning who said that although the tax concession was beneficial, it was not important or crucial. I am sure that the Minister understands the distinction. It was not he who said that industry would simply purchase gifts that included a logo; I said that myself. If I were in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
business today and involved in that business, that is what I would do. A manufacturer must maximise his production and distribution within the existing tax and legislative framework. Any business man who wants to get into that business and is now selling products costing between £2 and £10 to customers who cannot claim tax relief is mad if he does not include a logo and so ensure that he avoids corporation tax liability, In his company's interests it is better that he does not pay that tax, as companies take into account the possible tax consequences when making their decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to detain the Committee for long, but I want to record my disappointment that the Government have not only abandoned fiscal neutrality without a whimper, but have abandoned their aims of being a reforming Treasury team.<br><br>
What a timid reply the Financial Secretary gave! He simply took the list of items bequeathed to him, not by the last Labour Government, but by the Labour Government of 1965, and accepted what had gone before. Those glad, confident days of 1984 have gone and the Government are back to the old business of updating, indexing and increasing in line with inflation.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary was mistaken on one small point. It was not the Government who increased the limit from £1 to £2 in 1971. The record shows that the amendment was moved by a Conservative Back Bencher, Mr. Piers Dixon, who represented Truro at that time. It was accepted by the Conservative Government but this is the first time that any Government, either Conservative or Labour, has given way to that lobby. Indeed, what lobby? We are told that it is only the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Law Society of Scotland.<br><br>
I must also express some disappointment at the Minister's wriggling about the statistics. He told us that he knows how many items are given, he knows how many firms there are in the business but he cannot quantify the effect on the Inland Revenue of this increase from E2 to £10.<br><br>
Finally, in 1965 the Labour Government stopped tax relief for business entertainment. Is the Minister telling us that that has had a harmful effect on the business entertainment industry'? If not, why mess about with this tax relief?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for having neglected to answer one point. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) when he checks the record will know the answer anyway. Companies must disclose details of all expenses claimed as a deduction for tax so that the Inland Revenue can be satisfied that expenses are deductible.<br><br>
All I can say to the substantive point—I acknowledge it as such—made by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) is that the figures and the suggestions that he gave were outside the knowledge of the Inland Revenue. In my limited experience the Inland Revenue has considerable practical knowledge in most areas of business. However, the figures he raised were substantially different from anything that we have heard. Of course I shall look at the matter carefully. He would not wish

me to do other than listen with great care to what he says and the information that he has been given by outside organisations. I shall not make any commitment but I shall look at it seriously, because it is a different dimension to the size of the negligible amount of theoretical tax cost—not tax loss because it is an expenditure of legitimate businesses that we see in the context of that clause. I shall of course consider it on that basis.</span></p>

BUSINESS EXPANSION SCHEME</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Freeman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kettering)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 139, in page 41, line 29, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) for the purposes of this Schedule a company shall not be excluded from being treated as raising money for research and development merely because it intends to use or uses that money wholly or partly for research and development which it pays another person to carry out on its behalf and for the purposes of the new sub-paragraph (4) of paragraph 2 to this Schedule inserted by sub-paragraph (3) below research and development carried on for four months for and on behalf of the company first above mentioned shall be deemed to have been carried on by the company itself."</p></blockquote>
I have no direct interest to declare in the effects of the clause. However for the last 20 years, both as a chartered accountant and as an investment banker, I have been involved with research and development projects. I therefore have a close personal and professional interest in the clause.<br><br>
The clause extends the scope of the business expansion scheme. My amendment seeks to widen it further by permitting the business expansion scheme reliefs to apply not only to companies which carry out their own research and development but to those which commission third parties to carry out that research and development. I believe that that is a sensible addition to the provisions in the clause.<br><br>
I very much welcome the business expansion scheme. It has now been running for a full two years. It started in 1983.1 welcome the restrictions in the scheme which have been introduced in successive Budgets, but I particularly welcome the extension in the clause of the BES to research and development projects because it constitutes a breakthrough—I am sure that many of my hon. Friends will agree with me—in tax legislation. For the first time, tax relief is given not just for a commercial trade that is being undertaken but for pure research and development. Although certain conditions are attached in the clause which I fully accept and which my amendment does not touch, it represents an important first step.<br><br>
I hope that perhaps next year the Committee will return to the extension of the business expansion scheme still further, possibly to qualifying research and development partnerships. This is neither the time nor the place to describe their virtues but is the next logical step.<br><br>
There are a number of reason why amendment No. 139 should be considered and I should like to outline
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 328</span>
them briefly to the Committee. When a research and development project is undertaken by a newly formed company, in some cases that research must be contracted out to third parties</span></p>

<p>10.15 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to give the Committee valid reasons why a small research and development company—a possible beneficiary of the clause—might wish to contract out research and development work to a third party and why the benefits of the clause should not be denied to such a company.<br><br>
First, a small company formed by two or three individuals may wish to capitalise on an idea that has been worked on in a university or is a product of its own pure research. It may wish to continue a project over a period of years, with the assistance of funds from institutions and, through the business expansion scheme, from individuals, and may have to rely on third parties to do so. That is already a common occurence.<br><br>
Secondly, a company may wish to avoid duplicating the efforts of a university or research body. For example, in my constituency the research body for footwear and allied trades has conducted research benefiting the footwear industry for many years. It is therefore logical for small firms to contract out specific items of research and development work to that body. It is surely sensible to argue that a small company seeking the benefits of the business expansion scheme' provisions in the clause would not wish to reinvest the wheel or to undertake part of a complicated research and development project requiring the expertise of a third party. Rather, it would wish to contract the work out.<br><br>
Finally, many projects require expensive facilities —for example, laboratories and facilities to carry out operational research in the testing of new products. Small companies often cannot afford those facilities and therefore have to consider contracting out.<br><br>
I accept some of the tightly-drawn provisions that the Government have included in the clause. In addition to denying business expansion scheme relief to companies that mainly or substantially contract out research and development work, it specifies that the research and development company must be new, that later trade must result — that seems a sensible provision — that it must carry on the work for at least three years and that certain R and D activities should be excluded.<br><br>
I accept most of those tight and sensible provisions and I accept the need for the Revenue to draw up such provisions, but I would be grateful if the Financial Secretary would at least volunteer to monitor the effects of the clause to ascertain how the prohibition of the contracting out of R and D work to third parties hampers or harms the excellent and valid reasons for introducing the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the general support expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0705">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 329</span>
Freeman) for the Business Expansion Scheme and for the major extension of R and D that is embodied in the clause. He is right to identify that as a significant feature of the Bill.<br><br>
Clause 42 is designed to extend the BES to companies that are actively engaged in R and D, just as the scheme generally is for companies which are themselves carrying on a qualifying activity. The amendment would provide expressly for extension of the scheme to a company which had little or no R and D activities of its own, but simply raised finance for R and D to be carried on by any other organisation is perhaps, for example, an overseas company.<br><br>
The purpose of the scheme as a whole is to help small trading companies to raise equity finance that would not otherwise be forthcoming. Its underlying aim is to promote growth and development of activity in the small company sector. Certain activities, including those of a financial nature, are excluded, not because they are considered undesirable but because they do not fit easily within the underlying aims of the scheme. As my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering rightly said, most R and D companies would at present be unable to qualify because the scheme is for trading companies and R and D itself does not normally amount to trading. Clause 42 is designed to overcome that problem by extending the scheme to companies that raise finance for R and D from which they intend to derive and subsequently carry on a qualifying trade. As with trading companies, the aim is to promote genuine increased activity—I stress the word "increased". In this instance that means R and D activities as well as the activities involved in the trade that results.<br><br>
I stress to my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering that companies generally are not precluded under the scheme from contracting out some of their activities, or from employing others to act as their agents. When that happens it must be established in each case whether the activities of the company amount to carrying on a qualifying trade. Similarly, an R and D company which satisfies the conditions in clause 42 will not cease to qualify merely because it contracts out some of its R and D activites, provided that it can demonstrate that it intends to derive and carry on a qualifying trade from those activities.<br><br>
Some of the concerns that may have motivated the amendment are, I think, unfounded. But, as with companies generally, much will depend on the facts in each particular case. If, for example, a company had substantial R and D activities of its own and also retained full control over the rights in activities that were contracted out, it would qualify. By contrast, if the company carried on little R and D and if the terms of the agreement with the person contracted to undertake the outside R and D were such that in reality the contractor himself would have a greater say in what activity was undertaken, and would also have a substantial interest in the results of the R and D if successful, the company might not qualify.<br><br>
The amendment would shift the balance by providing expressly that the scheme was available to companies which existed solely as vehicles for raising finance for R and D, and where in extreme cases all of that R and D would be undertaken by someone else. Although the amendment provides that the R and D
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 330</span>
would be undertaken on behalf of the BES company, it is difficult to see what the main activity of the BES company itself would be, other than that of providing finance.<br><br>
As I have said, the BES scheme as a whole is not for essentially financial operations of this kind. Moreover, without many additional safeguards, such arrangements, if permitted, might simply become a means by which, for example, large, well-established United Kingdom or even overseas companies would be able to raise BES money in effect to finance their own R and D activities.<br><br>
For example, an established company that had set up a BES company in which it had a minority interest might be involved in a contract between itself and the BES company under which it would carry out R and D into a project with finance provided by the BES company. Under that contract or a separate one, the first company might also have sole rights, or at least a first option, to the use of the products of the R and D. In return for all that, the arrangement might be for the BES company to receive some royalty payments from the R and D if it proved successful. That is not what the scheme nor the clause is designed to achieve. If the scheme were to be put to such use—as a mere financing vehicle for already well-endowed companies and, possibly, for overseas companies, too—it would rapidly be brought into disrepute.<br><br>
I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Freeman) about careful monitoring. Yes, of course, we shall undertake such monitoring. Certainly, I shall watch carefully to see whether any problems arise in practice. I hope that on the basis of my remarks and that undertaking my hon. Friend will be willing to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary for his comments. I agree very much with him about avoiding such companies setting up financial shells, especially if overseas companies can exploit the generous concessions of the business expansion scheme.<br><br>
I believe that when the <i>Hansard</i> report is studied by those interested in the subject, the clarification given by my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will be warmly welcomed. Our initial reactions on reading the Bill was that it seemed that the contracting out of research and development to third parties was prohibited. I therefore believe that my hon. Friend's confirmation that that is still possible, provided the original company intends to carry on the trade, will be welcomed. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 133, in page 41, line 36, leave out 'immediately' and insert `within six months'.<br><br>
The amendment deals with the timing of the commencement of research and development activity. The clause provides that research and development must be carried on "at the time" of the issue of the shares or "immediately thereafter". The amendment would broaden that provision so that to qualify under the business expansion scheme research and develop
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0706">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 331</span>
ment must be carried on either at the time of the issue of the shares or "within six months".<br><br>
I wish to advance two arguments for my amendment which are designed to probe the Revenue's thinking on the issue, which has caused some consternation and confusion to those interested in the financing of research and development. Although this may seem a small issue, it is important and practical.<br><br>
The first argument is on the vagueness of the phrase "immediately thereafter". No definition is given in the Bill of the phrase. Does it mean at once, very soon after or as soon as is possible? I am grateful to one of my hon. Friends for drawing my attention to the definition in the "Oxford English Dictionary" of the word "immediately", which is "the moment that" or "as soon as". If definition is a very tight one and the phrase "immediately thereafter" means the moment that as soon as. or that very moment, the phrase is redundant because the clause could simply provide for relief to be available only at the time of the issue of shares. Any other qualification would not be relevant. The only relevance of including the phrase is if it means other than at the precise moment when the shares are issued.<br><br>
10.30 pm<br><br>
The second argument is directed to whether there is a need for any time limit. Subsection (2) refers to a limit of four months—the period in which the investor must hold his investment in the business expansion scheme financing the research and development project before relief is obtainable. That four-month limit covers the period of activity in the research and development company before the relief is permitted to the investor. If that four-month provision already applies, I cannot see that any other provision in line 36 is necessary. The amendment seeks to probe the reason behind the wording of the clause, which is not clear to those interested in the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly reinforce the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr Freeman). The use of the word "immediately" goes back to the business start-up scheme which preceded the business expansion scheme. The word caused considerable difficulties for companies under the business start-up scheme. Very often a company will be formed with the intention that the shareholders could take advantage of the scheme, but with the intention also of starting a new business.<br><br>
It is impossible for a business to be started immediately upon the issue of shares because the time scale implied in the phrase is too short. Can my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary indicate the definition of "immediately" that is regarded as inherent in the clause, or can he confirm that "immediately" is capable of reasonable interpretation? To the best of my knowledge, the word has not been the subject of a court's definition in regard to the business start-up scheme, so there is an area of potential litigation. The Inland Revenue could deny relief to a company, which otherwise had been correctly formed to take advantage of relief under the business expansion scheme, because of the impossibility of complying with "immediately".</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 332</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind my hon Friends the Members for Kettering (Mr. Freeman) and for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stern) that the clause introduces specially favourable treatment under the business expansion scheme for research and development companies. It seems right that this special treatment should be available only under certain conditions. The amendment seeks to relax one of those proposed conditions and I shall explain why it would not be appropriate.<br><br>
Under the normal rules for BES companies, a company is allowed up to two years from the issue of BES shares in which to commence its qualifying trade. It is thus recognised that in the case of start-ups time may be needed for preparing premises, installing equipment and for all the other activities that are necessary before trading can commence.<br><br>
Investors cannot claim their relief until the company has started trading and carried on the trade for four months. There is a distinction between the ability of a company to receive and issue shares and the ability of investors to obtain relief and this provides an incentive for companies to start trading as soon as possible. It avoids the possibility that investors might get relief even though, for a period, their investment was held by the company on risk-free deposit pending the start of trading.<br><br>
To remain eligible, companies must continue to satisfy the various qualifying conditions throughout the relevant period, which is the period beginning when the BES shares are issued. The period ends three years later—if the company was trading when the shares were issued—or three years after the subsequent start of trading. So for companies generally the relevant period varies, case by case, from a minimum of three years to a maximum of five years. Money is therefore at risk for that lengthy period.<br><br>
Clause 42 is designed to help companies raise finance for R and D from which they intend to derive a qualifying trade that they will carry on. But R and D itself does not normally amount to trading, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering has recognised. and investors have no guarantee that an R and D company will be able to start trading within the two-year time limit. Indeed, if the R and D is abortive it may never start trading and so the investors would never get their relief.<br><br>
To overcome this problem, clause 42 provides special treatment for R and D companies. Investors in these companies will be able to claim their relief—subject to the R and D having been carried on for four months, which is exactly parallel with the BES—even though the company will be engaged in what would normally for other BES companies be regarded as pre-trading activities. Moreover, the relevant period for R and D companies will be a maximum of three years, compared to a maximum of five years in the case of start-up companies generally that take up to two years in which to commence trading.<br><br>
Given this special treatment it seems reasonable to require that the company should make a start on its R and D activities as soon as the BES shares have been issued, if indeed—as will often be the case—it has not already started. Moreover, if it is to succeed in raising
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0707">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 333</span>
BES finance in the first place, the company will need to convince potential investors that it has a well thought out R and D programme which, if successful, is likely to prove commercially exploitable and profitable. It therefore seems reasonable to assume that companies which have succeeded in raising BES finance will be in a position anyway to make an immediate start on some of the proposed R and D activities.<br><br>
Both my hon. Friends the Members for Kettering and for Bristol, North-West asked me to be more precise to help the outside world to understand the nature of the way in which the Inland Revenue would regard the practical use of the word "immediately". What concerns the Committee is not so much the principle but the practical consequences.<br><br>
It does mean that the Inland Revenue would expect a full-scale R and D effort to start on the day following the BES share issue. Clearly, the Inland Revenue will not expect to see R and D in full swing so early. But it will be looking for some immediate start to activities relevant to the R and D.<br><br>
We want to avoid an arbitrary limit of when R and D should begin—whether it be six months or, as others have suggested, three months—and that is what the amendment suggests. Such a limit would be consistent with the idea that R and D work is something which is preparatory for trading and is capable of being started straight away.<br><br>
If we went down the road of having a specific and arbitrary limit, it would then be necessary to extend the "relevant period" throughout which the company must satisfy the qualifying conditions if it is to remain eligible. At present, it is proposed that this should run for three years from the date the BES shares are issued. But if a company was not required to start its R and D immediately, the relevant period would need to run for a period beginning with the issue of the BES shares and ending three years after the subsequent start of R and D.<br><br>
Without such a condition, investors in a company which does not start its R and D activity immediately would be at an advantage compared to those investing in a company engaged in R and D from day one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friends. The promotors of BES issues, which usually take the form of the issue of a prospectus, very often have a minimum subscription requirement before the prospectus becomes activated. Unless and until that minimum subscription is reached the business will not start. That necessarily takes time from knowing whether that has happened to actually starting the scheme. If one does not know what the word "immediately" means it will be difficult to insert in the prospectus the necessary wording to convince investors that they will get relief. A definition of "immediately" or the provision of some specific period would make it much easier for the promotors of such schemes. If there is not a specific period it will be difficult to promote schemes with a public prospectus.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what my hon. Friend says, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West rightly pointed out, given the practical experience of the business start-up scheme and the existing experience of the business expansion scheme,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 334</span>
I am not sure that it would be of advantage to the outside world to go beyond my relatively pragmatic and practical comments about the way in which the R and D scheme would work, but we should perhaps think more carefully before adding to the statutory requirements because in many ways that would restrain the potential development of the schemes. However, I note what has been said and shall certainly consider the matter further.<br><br>
I hope that on the basis of my undertaking and comments, my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering will be willing to withdraw what he said was basically a probing amendment to get clearer information on to the record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary for saying that the spirit of the Inland Revenue's interpretation of what will shortly become section 42 of the Finance Act 1985 will be pragmatic and reasonable. I accept the argument that if we try to substitute for "immediately" something more precise, such as three or six months, it might have consequences for the three-year period of activity and for the four-month period before which investors can claim relief. Therefore, on the basis of the Financial Secretary's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hirst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 141, in page 42, line 18, leave out 'of its consisting' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'that at any time after 19th March 1985 it consists'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take amendment No. 142, in page 43, line 7, leave out 'Subsections (2) and (4) have' and insert 'sub-section (2) has'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hirst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 42(7) restricts the business expansion scheme relief to qualifying R and D companies which issue shares on or after 6 April 1985. That provides new and untried companies with a competitive advantage which may not have been available to companies which are now in the business expansion scheme. Amendment No. 141 seeks to enable companies which have already issued shares and have qualified for relief to continue to qualify, if they receive after 19 April 1985 substantial royalties or licence fees from research and development which they have carried out.<br><br>
This is a modest amendment which seeks basically to backdate potential relief from 6 April to Budget day. It is in line with many other fiscal changes which are made retroactive to the date of announcement.<br><br>
Amendment No. 142 is consequential to amendment No. 141, which although it is modest is potentially useful. I hope that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will be able at least to sympathise with the spirit behind the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Hirst) for the way in which he has moved amendment No. 141, but the clause extends the BES to R and D companies in respect of shares in such companies issued on or after 6 April 1985.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0708">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 335</span>
As my hon. Friend explained, the amendments are designed to extend the benefit of one of the provisions in clause 42 to R and D companies which have already issued shares under the BES—that is, before 6 April 1985—and which now wish to exploit the product of the R and D by means of royalties or licence fees. Under the normal rules for BES companies generally, a company is ineligible if a substantial part of its income is derived from royalities or licence fees.<br><br>
Clause 42 provides, inter alia, that notwithstanding that general exclusion, a company with such income will be eligible under the scheme provided that two conditions are met. First, it must be engaged in R and D activity throughout the relevant period, and secondly, all of its income from royalities or licence fees must relate to R and D which it has itself carried out.<br><br>
However, because the change will apply only to companies issuing shares under the BES after 5 April 1985, companies carrying out R and D whose BES shares were issued prior to that date will be unable to benefit from the change. Therefore, if an R and D company which has already issued BES shares has substantial royalty income, the existing BES investors would stand to lose their relief, even though anyone investing in the company after 5 April would be eligible for relief.<br><br>
The amendments would prevent what I recognise as a slightly anomalous position arising. They would allow an R and D company which had issued BES shares before 6 April 1985 to have, for periods after Budget day, substantial income from royalties or licence fees without causing the existing BES investors to lose their relief; the other conditions of Clause 42 would have to be met.<br><br>
10.45 pm<br><br>
It could be argued that special treatment in this instance was not justified, as BES investors and the R and D companies in which they invested both knew when the shares were issued the consequences of their having substantial royalty income. Again, it is unlikely that more than a handful of companies would benefit from the proposed change, but that could be seen as an unwarrantably hard-faced view of the matter. As I have shown, the rules would operate a little uneasily, especially when an R and D company received a substantial royalty income. However, in the light of what my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Barsden said so ably on the amendment, I recommend its acceptance by the Committee.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to:</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made</i>: No. 142, in page 43, line 7, leave out "Subsections (2) and (4) have" and insert "subsection (2) has".—[<i>Mr. Hirst.</i>]</p>
<p><i>On proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must in all conscience welcome at least part of Clause 42—namely, the exclusion of property development companies from the scheme. But I remind the Committee that on 17 May 1984 I spoke about various press reports on the operation of the business expansion scheme and mentioned
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 336</span>
particularly the <i>Financial Times</i> leader of March 20 which said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There are other examples where BES funds have been channelled into property-backed enterprises which would surely have found willing investors without the scheme."</p></blockquote>
I then asked why the words "property development" were not included in the clause, but no clear answer was given. Nevertheless, this year Clause 42 has been brought forward—representing, I assume, considerable further cost to the taxpayer.<br><br>
Let us consider two recent comments on the BES, one in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 17 April which refers to the number of property groups
<br><blockquote><p>"which scrambled to raise BES equity in the months before the Budget, spurred on by a fear that they would suffer the same fate as farming ventures, which were cut out of the BES in the 1984 Budget".</p></blockquote>
It is estimated that property developers raised £50 million to £60 million in the tax year to April 1985; others believe that the figure was even higher, and suggest that in the past two months alone about 20 issues have been launched aiming to raise more than £85 million. Therefore the delay of a year in expunging property developments from the BES must have been extremely costly for the Revenue. But no estimate has been provided for us of the tax cost of the BES in the financial year that has just ended.<br><br>
Even so, I wonder whether the clause goes far enough in respect of property developments. For example, it is still open to a syndicate of investors to buy, say, a shop through a business expansion scheme company and, if the shop only breaks even, the investors will make a fat profit when eventually they sell the business, having effectively bought the shop at a discount because of tax relief. One wonders whether the Minister considers that the clause has been sufficiently tightly drawn to exclude that happening.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary kindly answered my questions yesterday, so they are available for today's debate on the business expansion scheme. The distribution of the £100 million invested under the scheme in 1983–84 in more than 500 companies suggested that the bulk of the investment went into manufacturing, which is to be welcomed. Service industries came second, with £112 million; wholesale and retail distribution had £79 million; construction, £23 million and, as that was the year in which agriculture was allowed, it accounted for a further £10 million.<br><br>
That survey did not cover all the companies. More than 100 were left out of the analysis because detailed information about them was unavailable. Even so, we know that in the first year of operation of the scheme, although only 10 companies were involved in agriculture, horticulture or fishing, they took a disproportionate amount of the available tax revenue.<br><br>
It is a pity that we continue to discuss the business expansion scheme without a proper study being available. One private study is available and, although it is useful to have it, it is not especially adequate. The Financial Secretary said that the Treasury's study commissioned from Peat Marwick Mitchell was due to be published in October, but I repeat that it is a great pity that once again we are discussing this scheme without adequate information. Although the study will

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 337</span>
be useful when it eventually arrives, it is regretable that we have to wait so long for it.<br><br>
Available figures suggest that in 1983-84, £100 million was invested in companies that I have already mentioned. The direct revenue cost of tax relief then was about £50 million. No figures are available for 1984-85, and it is a matter of anxiety as to how much was spent quite unnecessarily on property companies, given the Opposition's warnings during the last financial year.<br><br>
It is clear that the business expansion scheme benefits higher rate taxpayers. The Financial Secretary's answer to my question of Monday 3 June was that the average rate of tax relief for investments under the business expansion scheme was about 50 per cent. He said that figures were not yet available for 1984–85. He revealed that an analysis of marginal tax rates of BES investors in 1983–84 showed that for marginal income tax at 30 per cent. the percentage of investors was 10 per cent.; for 40 to 55 per cent., 35 per cent.; for 60 to 70 per cent., 30 per cent., and that at 75 per cent. there were 25 per cent. of investors. The vast majority, 85 per cent. paid tax at marginal rates of 40 per cent. and above. Therefore, the business investment scheme benefits higher rate taxpayers — a very small band of people, as we discovered in earlier debates.<br><br>
The business expansion scheme is unlikely to meet one of the objectives which Ministers have described for it—to spread share ownership more widely among the population through offering a tax incentive for people, it is alleged, who are willing to invest in high-risk enterprises which might not otherwise be able to raise funds. We have discovered that the majority of investors are among the better off and some of the schemes into which they put their money could hardly be described as high risk. The term "high risk" does not apply to agricultural investment, which was allowed under the scheme at one stage, or to property development by which so much money has apparently been raised during the last financial year.<br><br>
It is worth looking more closely at the operation of the scheme. I wish to make it clear that we do not object to the extension of the scheme to research and development, provided that it is carefully applied and it is hoped that special efforts are being made by the Government to encourage high-risk investments of that kind. That is qualified by our doubts about the effectiveness and control of the overall operation of the scheme. It is proper for the Government to wish to encourage research and development, but whether the scheme is the best method of doing so is open to question. Such questions may be resolved when the report is published.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady said at the start of her speech that she especially welcomed the exclusion of property development and went on to say that the Opposition did not object to the extension of relief to research and development. Will the hon. Lady clarify the Opposition's position on the scheme as a whole? Do they consider it worthwhile relief?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already raised some of the scheme's problems. I have said that we are waiting for the full report on its operation. We do not have the figures for 1984–85. The figures available make it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 338</span>
doubtful that the scheme is the best way of encouraging research and development and investment in manufacturing industry.<br><br>
I shall go on to other criticisms of the way in which the scheme operates and the kind of businesses in which investment takes place. In excluding property development, the legislation is following a pattern adopted in other areas of tax. The Government legislate and the operators use and exploit the rules; the Government block one loophole and the operators discover another so that the Government have to step in to block that loophole. The original idea behind the business start-up scheme and its replacement, the business expansion scheme, was to give help to the new high-tech industries of the future. Of course, neither farming nor property development come within that remit. It is entirely proper to exclude those industries from the scheme.<br><br>
Although the tax subsidies to purchase prime farmland were an obvious abuse of the scheme, it is not easy to determine whether the scheme as a whole has been a success or whether it has simply provided a gigantic tax break to the better off. That is the suspicion that has been aroused in us by the breakdown of investors who benefit from the scheme because 85 per cent. of them turn out to be higher rate taxpayers.<br><br>
11 pm<br><br>
However, there are other causes for criticism. The scheme encourages investment not only in farming but in property. All kinds of property schemes have been produced, and I have brought a few of the brochures for such property development. For example, there are Great Gable plc, Fraser House Commercial Developments plc and Roman Homes plc. The latter is offered for subscription under the business expansion scheme, it is sponsored by Capital Ventures Ltd., a licensed dealer in securities, and it offers housing for the elderly.<br><br>
I have another prospectus that is significant from our point of view. Unfortunately, it is for private circulation only, so, although I can refer to it, I cannot give details of the source of the quotation. However, we need to learn from the Minister how many copies of this prospectus have been issued. It is designed for the nursing home market and it claims that, since the inception of the NHS in 1948, the practice of medicine has been revolutionised by diagnostic and therapeutic advances. It states that the appetite for funds created by these advances is voracious, so Government resources will never be able to satisfy the financial requirements of every sector of the Health Service. Therefore, the prospectus offers investment opportunities under the BES scheme for private medicine in direct competition with the Health Service.<br><br>
In regard to nursing homes for the elderly, for the physically and mentally handicapped, registered private nursing homes providing care for the sick—any kind of illness being covered by these—and the cost of meeting provision for private residential and nursing care, there are schemes to meet all of those various functions in direct competition with the Health Service or, if one is to be pedantic, with the social services. All are being proposed under the business expansion scheme, and I ask the Financial Secretary to tell the Committee whether such schemes should fall under the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0710">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 339</span>
business expansion scheme and whether the Government are really willing to support and encourage, through a system of tax reliefs, the investors who want to make money out of nursing care of various kinds being provided in that way.<br><br>
They are certainly set up in direct competition with the NHS, and it seems ridiculous that the Government should refuse money for those sectors of the NHS which are in dire need of funds and yet be able to find the money for tax relief for the rich, because only rich people will be able to afford private nursing care of that kind. Are the Government really going to provide money through tax relief for schemes of this nature which are described as the "forms of innovation or enterprise" which society allegedly needs? Tax relief—our money—is being used for the purpose of providing care which only the very well off can afford.<br><br>
It seems to me that there is a serious contradiction in what the Government are doing. They say that they do not have the money for the NHS to provide essential forms of nursing care for many people or for residential care. We are talking about the physically and mentally handicapped, the long-term sick, people who are unable to look after themselves and may have no family to assist them, and the elderly. For all of those forms of care, it appears that schemes can be set up which can obtain money under the business expansion scheme. Money will go from the better-off to the better-off, as it is the investors in the higher rate tax bands who will want to make such investments. It is only those who come from well-off families who will be able to afford to pay for such care in private nursing homes of various kinds to meet the needs of the mentally or physically handicapped and sick or elderly relatives. Those will be the people covered by the scheme.<br><br>
It is difficult for the Opposition to assess such schemes. We need to know how many have been recognised by the Inland Revenue and what the costs to the Exchequer are of subsidising such schemes. It is certainly more difficult for us to oppose a BES scheme when it applies to some kind of manufacturing venture, perhaps a small firm, which would find it difficult to obtain the necessary funds through the normal means—a bank loan, for example. Property development has now been ruled out. I have a prospectus here from the Mount Street Fine Wine Company plc, which I cannot believe would find it difficult to find the funds requied for investment. Yet this one has issued a prospectus under the BES scheme. We are not sure what will happen to nursing care. We have cause to doubt the usefulness of the scheme.<br><br>
Another more general point about the operation of the scheme is that the pattern of BES investment has been dominated by the large managed fund. When the legislation covering the BSS and BES was established, it allowed the information of approved investment funds. Individuals would invest direct with the fund and share in the financial results of the pooled investments in a way similar to that employed in unit trust funds where individuals buy units in a pooled fund of investment.<br><br>
Although it is not a particularly good report, the Operation and Effectiveness of the BES: Small
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 340</span>
Business Research Trust: May 1985 report noted that of the £80 million raised in 1983–84, £4 million was invested by the managed funds. Of the remainder, £13 million was accounted for by a subscription to "Beechbank Farmers", a direct farm investment raised via an offer for subscription. If that figure is excluded, nearly two thirds of qualifying investments were made by the professional money manages of mainly London-based finance houses.<br><br>
There is nothing wrong with that development in itself, but it is clear that those funds are managed by people who manage non-BES funds on behalf of, say, pension funds, and it appears that the same basic investment policy is used for both funds.<br><br>
It is clear that the tax incentive has become an added bonus for investors rather than a compensation for a much higher risk investment profile [Interruption]. The sums likely to be advanced under the BES will probably be substantial—[<i>Interruption</i>].</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that Committee members know how I feel about seated interventions. There is a general murmuring. I know that the hour is getting later, but it is only fair to the hon. Member who has the Floor that he or she should be listened to in comparative silence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For most of the funds, £50,000 is the minimum that they are prepared to advance, and for many the minimum figure is nearer to £100,000. The requirements for many small firms are much smaller than that. They do not require amounts of £50,000 or £100,000. They require small amounts, and it is precisely small firms that need loans or capital of £10,000, f20,000 or £30,000 for which the BES was devised.<br><br>
We have no quarrel with that aim. We want to ensure that small firms can obtain those sums through loans or investment. The amounts may be small in terms of what large and medium-sized firms require, but they can be essential to get small firms off the ground.<br><br>
However, from the kind of prospectuses that I have been reading, it is clear that large amounts are being raised by professionals. The Lazard Brothers prospectus is a good example. Then, investors get just the extra bonus that I described.<br><br>
If that is how the BES operates, it does not meet the aims that the Government set for it initially. Although we may be talking about only £50 million of tax revenue in the financial year before last, that money could have been used far more effectively to help small firms with high-risk-ventures. The Government could have helped them directly through soft loans or grants. The Labour party favours a soft loan system rather than a grants system. The money could have been used more effectively and directed towards companies that needed it.<br><br>
During the past two years of the scheme's operation, money has gone down the drain to companies that do not need it. It has been used for property and farming developments and even for a fine wine company. I am sure that the Mount Street Fine Wine Company plc does not need such special assistance.<br><br>
The nursing home prospectus is utterly disgraceful.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 341</span>
The Government cannot find essential funds for the NHS, but they can find them to help the better off obtain nursing care that is being denied far too many of our constituents—care that they need urgently and which they manifestly do not receive. I am sure that Conservative Members have many such cases in their constituencies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Watts <span class='memberconstituency'>(Slough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is very lucky. Many of my elderly constituents urgently require residential care. It is not available to them under part III accommodation and there is no way that their families can afford the kind of nursing care described in the private care prospetus. It is disgraceful that the Government can find money for private care but that they cannot make such care available through the NHS or social services.<br><br>
We have serious doubts about the scheme's operations. Unless the Financial Secretary can allay our doubts we shall return to the issue on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take up briefly one point raised by the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald). I am involved in the company that managed the venture that she mentioned and which hopes to do so this year. It is invevitable that there will be professional intermediaries between companies and investors. Most companies wishing to raise money want to do so from more than one investor at a time and no sensible investor wants to put all his money into one company. It is natural that investment should be made by funds and that some professional intermediaries should be involved.<br><br>
Will my hon Friend the Financial Secretary consider for next year's Finance Bill if not for this two minor changes that will improve BES? First, I said last year that companies are restricted to only wholly—owned subsidiaries. There are companies that would benefit from BES investment—the groups of companies of which the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) spoke, involved in manufacturing or real business. That, I think, is the distinction that she sought to make. They may have been around as groups for a long time, and one of their many subsidiaries has a few shares in someone else's hands which simply cannot be traced, let alone bought back. I know of at least one such example. Surely we could make a minor exemption for a small minority shareholding in one or more subsidiaries of a group.<br><br>
The other change that I should like my hon. Friend to consider is to allow relief to companies against corporation tax as well as to individuals against income tax, obviously with some limit either in total amount or percentage of taxable profits. Companies are often aware of business opportunities for either suppliers or customers which they might be willing to finance. They are often more aware of the genuine business opportunities that the hon. Member for Thurrock mentioned than are passive investors. If companies were allowed relief against corporation tax, with some reasonable and modest limits on the amount that they can invest, some good business opportunities could be financed from that source. I hope that my hon. Friend
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 342</span>
will consider those two points as possible amendments to the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem with opinion polls is that when the Government drop below 30 per cent.—as this Government have done—their Back Benchers become a bit reckless, and tonight we have had a few reckless gestures by Tory Back Benchers. The speech just made by the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr Maples) had all the characteristics of a rather reckless statement, and I am sure that the Minister will know how to respond, certainly to his second suggestion.<br><br>
Many Conservative Members do not know what happened in our debates some years ago when the Finance Bill Committee established the original businss expansion scheme. The hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr Major), who is now a Government Whip, was a member of that Committee, and he will recall the debates. Were he allowed to speak, he would admit that what has happened is not what was intended by the Government at that time. We did not think then that companies which had set up as professional intermediaries in the way the hon. Member for Lewisham, West described would need a minimum investment of £100,000. That was never the intention of the scheme. It was designed to help the early construction of small companies. Large sums of money were not part of the dialogue that took place in Committee. It was very much a small business debate.<br><br>
I can tell the hon. Member for Lewisham, West that I was one of the few Labour Members who vigorously supported the original businss expansion scheme, and I did so on the basis that it would not be abused. I remember some of my hon. Friends counselling me and saying, "Dale, be careful, because it may well turn into an area of abuse." My hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock effectively put the case that abuses have developed in the way that my hon. Friends feared.<br><br>
The scheme no longer reflects the Government's original intention. Moreover, a report has been commissioned by the Small Business Research Trust which was founded in 1983 and sponsored by the National Westminster Bank, Sainsbury and Shell Petroleum. It carried out research under a chap called Geoffrey Pointon of Pointon York, the licensed dealers, and produced some interesting findings. It said that there was a poor take-up of the scheme in the regions, and that most of the money was going into the south-east of England and the home counties.<br><br>
I realise that the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock is in the south-east, and I am sure that she would want to defend her area, but she will know that all these business incentive schemes were originally designed to have at least some regional component. They were seen as part of the regional incentive structure of Government policy. The term "region" may have been built into the legislation, but it was certainly expected that the schemes would have a regional effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They still do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that the schemes still do have a regional effect, but when he talks of regions he includes the south-east. He
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0712">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 343</span>
is right to do so, but when I talk of regions I am thinking of the north, part of which I represent, as do my hon. Friends the Members for Burnley (Mr. Pike), for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) and for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). Even the Liberal Member on the Committee, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), represents a part of Scotland. My Hon. Friends the Members for Sedgefield (Mr Blair), for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr Randall) and for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) are all far from the south-east of England.<br><br>
We believe that these schemes should work in such a way as to help the northern region and other areas of high unemployment. All the evidence from this research suggests that that has not been the case. The survey shows that half the companies that are claiming under the schemes come from the home counties and two-thirds from the south-east of England and the home counties together. That means that the schemes, which have been good in many ways, favour a very small part of the population.<br><br>
I know that it may be difficult to build regional criteria into financial legislation, but every year I have argued that we should find some mechanism to enable us to do so. I believe that, once again, and now that we have the evidence of the report, we must seek to build regional criteria into such tax concessions.<br><br>
The truth is that the bulk of the money is now going into established companies. My hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock dealt with that point in detail. The survey shows that the managers interviewed for the Small Business Research Trust said that the two-thirds of the companies—I think that the total examined was 100—would have raised the money anyway in some other way. We can assume that they would have borrowed the money from the bank, and that the Government would not have had to give away large sums of tax-payers' money. As my hon. Friend suggested, it has in the main been enjoyed by the higher-paid.<br><br>
I do not wish to pour cold water on a scheme which I have always supported, and which I believe was set up with good intentions. But I have seen the new intake of Tory MPs and I believe that they do not understand the scheme's original intentions and that they now see it as a method of dodging taxes. For many that it what it has become; it is no longer the scheme originally envisaged. It was to attract unemployed people into business by encouraging them to find sponsors.<br><br>
I was one of those who supported the setting up of trusts to organise the insertion of capital into these smaller businesses. The scheme has been abused. The Minister must take heed of the considerable reservations felt by me and by those who look at these matters objectively and try to be honest to the scheme's original principles.<br><br>
Although there is no statutory requirement I am told that the majority of the larger funds involved will not lend less than £100,000. Why cannot we build into the legislation on business expansion schemes a mechanism that will require the funds to lend smaller sums? A person who goes to the funds and says, "I want only £20,000 or £10,000", should if he is turned down, have the right of appeal.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 344</span>
I am sure that the Minister could devise some body to which the applicant could appeal or that some arrangement could be built into the legislation whereby the funds must, in order to secure the tax relief, give evidence of a balanced portfolio including businesses which want loans substantially smaller than £100,000.<br><br>
All those changes would help to recreate the integrity of a scheme which was provided by Parliament as a credible solution to the problems that Parliament believed existed at the time and which needed a novel approach to business generation. My hon. Friend supported that package, together with the enterprise allowance and other little measures that were introduced. We looked at them objectively because we knew that jobs had to be created.<br><br>
We were not convinced that traditional regional policy had been the answer or that the current tax regime at that time was sufficient to induce people into business. We believed that the changes were necessary, but it was never dreamt that they would be responsible for the glossy portfolio that my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock has produced. Those documents show that the organisations that have taken advantage of the scheme in this way are misusing the original intention. The scheme was examined closely and debated at length in Committee, and those organisations are abusing what we set up with good intentions.<br><br>
I turn specifically to the question of land and call for changes to be made in the arrangements. The notes on clauses say that
<br><blockquote><p>"excludes property development as a qualifying trade under the BES where the company doing the development has an interest in the land or property that is being developed. Building and construction companies which do not have an interest in the land or property being developed will not normally be affected and will continue to qualify."</p></blockquote>
How can we stop people deferring a right to acquire the property that they have developed through a construction company in which they have a commercial interest? By deferring and getting an agreement to purchase and with an option on the right to acquire in a conveyancing transaction, they may be able effectively to retain the position that they enjoyed prior to the introduction of the clause.<br><br>
Secondly, to what extent can we ensure that an adequate arm's-length relationship will exist between those who develop and those who own land? Relatives within families or relationships between companies might be sufficiently lacking in distance as effectively to restore the position prior to the introduction of this clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a relatively lengthy, but interesting debate and it may be useful if I go back to the basics from which the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) started. The hon. Lady welcomed the exclusion of property companies and, by definition, the inclusion of R and D.<br><br>
I do not want to go to too great a length in dealing with some aspects of what the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) said but I shall come back to his specific points when I have better advice. I respect his commitments to the intent of the scheme and to treat the report of the Small Business
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0713">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 345</span>
Research Trust with considerable care while awaiting with interest the Government's work on this subject and I draw his attention to the remarks of the hon. Member for Thurrock about the character of the scheme.<br><br>
I heard one point loud and clear and we all need to remember it. The hon. Gentleman identified one of the genuine dilemmas in our country—the regional point. Whatever one says about the data, there is a regional imbalance. I am not sure what the answer is, although the hon. Gentleman may like to know that there are some encouraging developments, such as many local BES investment syndicates which are often based on local enterprise agencies. I particularly draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the St. Helens BES syndicate in Liverpool whose results look extremely interesting. That syndicate may well be copied in other parts of the country.<br><br>
I shall go back to the beginning of the debate as it is important to introduce a sense of perspective. We were given the impression that the scheme had not succeeded. Many of my hon. Friends have been strong supporters of the scheme throughout and they would want me to put on the record the fact that this novel and highly innovative scheme is, generally speaking, a considerable success. That is the basic starting point.<br><br>
11.30 pm<br><br>
I should therefore like to record one or two facts and figures. We have sought to publicise as much of the data as possible. I am somewhat surprised that our attention has not been drawn to the report on the business expansion scheme in the Economic Progress Report of December 1984 which recorded much of the data from 1983–84 which has been discussed here. The final picture is likely to show direct investment accounting for 60 per cent. of the total and investment from the funds accounting for the rest—40 per cent. The majority still comes from direct rather than fund investment.<br><br>
On the basis of the results so far, more than half the total investment went to start-ups and 36 per cent. of the total went to very young start-ups—companies or trades that are less than a year old. Almost all the companies invested in were small or very small. Over half—53 per cent.—had loan and equity capital and reserves of less than £100,000 prior to the BES issue. Eighty per cent. had fewer than 50 employees and over 40 per cent. had fewer than ten. We have to keep some of those facts in the back of our minds when we look critically at the scheme.<br><br>
The scheme has also helped companies raising small amounts, a point that particularly concerned the hon. Member for Thurrock. Of the companies invested in, 55 per cent. each raised £100,000 or less; 38 per cent. each raised £50,000 or less. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I accept that there are other facts, but we ought to get the other side of the story on to the record.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Thurrock rightly said, my reply to a parliamentary question yesterday was that the scheme has helped companies in a wide variety of businesses. She is right to draw our attention to the fact that of the 397 companies to which I referred in yesterday's parliamentary question, the largest number, 156, were in manufacturing. The scheme has affected positively the manufacturing sector.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 346</span>
I cannot yet give data for the year 1984–85. I can only say that investment by the funds is at least as much as in 1983-84. The hon. Lady is quite right to draw our attention to the problems; we are trying to concern ourselves with those problems by making changes through the clause and by removing the property area. However, I cannot give detailed figures. Firm figures are not yet available about the BES investment in the property field. It seems probable that investment in such companies in 1984–85 was substantial.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Thurrock asked whether the clause has been drawn tightly enough. That is a difficult question. I have to answer yes at this stage because to go further would effectively mean excluding all companies with an interest in land property assets of most kinds. That would include most manufacturing companies. Obviously, as our removal of a sector from the scheme this years shows, we shall be watching that very carefully.<br><br>
The scheme is halfway through its present four-year life. As we have said, later this year the Government will want to start reviewing its longer-term future. It is too early to predict the outcome of the review or its completion date. But we recognise the desirability of announcing any plans for the longer-term future well before the present scheme comes to an end in April 1987.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Thurrock kept saying in essence that we should have had an analysis of that earlier. But the scheme is only two years old. It would have been difficult to analyse the data earlier. The in-depth study of the scheme by outside consultants is now underway. The aim of the study is to help us to learn more about the success of the scheme in achieving its underlying objectives. In particular, we want to know how successful it has been in helping companies to attract new, genuinely additional, equity investment that would not otherwise have been forthcoming and also the extent to which business investment has resulted in genuinely new or expanded activity. The results of the study will obviously be of great help in informing decisions about the future of the scheme. Let me correct one small point. The study is due to be completed by the end of October, and, as I said in answer to the parliamentary question, I intend to publish its results in due course.<br><br>
Some hon. Members concentrated on the fact that those in the upper income bracket would benefit through tax relief on the scheme. The main aim of the scheme is to meet the equity needs of small firms which would otherwise remain unmet. Additionality is the key measure of effectiveness, and that is what the study by Peat Marwick Mitchell is designed to assess. I do not see why it should matter that a genuine additional investment, leading to new activity, new jobs and all the aims that the hon. Members for Workington rightly wishes the scheme to achieve, should come from higher rate taxpayers rather than from others. By definition, those in the higher rate tax brackets will benefit more and will be more likely to be attracted to invest in high risk activity.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Maples) raised two points. I thought that I had explained last year that there were real practical difficulties with other BES rules in allowing less than wholly-owned subsidiaries. I have looked, and will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: Sc1984-1985V002P0I0714">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 347</span>
look again, at the points that he raised. Let me also remind him that a procedure exists under the Companies Act—I am sure that he will know of this—whereby if 90 per cent. of shares are held, an appeal can be made to the courts to acquire the balance.<br><br>
Mr hon. Friend also talked about the possibility of the Government's considering the potential for relief to companies against corporation tax. I remind him that the ethos of the scheme was that the high potential relief afforded to individuals had to be closely related to high risk, which ought to have a close equity connection. That limits the provision to individuals. That must be a key feature of the scheme, and I cannot encourage my hon. Friend to think that I shall look at his second suggestion favourably.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Workington asked about property deferral. I assure him that the option to acquire land at a later date would itself amount to an interest in the land.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At what stage would someone who was taking advantage of the concession indicate that he had an interest? His option might not be published. It might not be available for the Revenue to see. Indeed, there is no reason why the Revenue should see it. The conveyance would take place without a reference being made to any document or contract entered into to secure a deferred purchase.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman on that, but I shall examine his point. He approaches the scheme with a view to trying to ensure its success, and I shall certainly return to the matter if I am not completely satisfied.<br><br>
I now come to the point made by the hon. Member for Thurrock.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You have not answered. my second question, about arm's-length relationships.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that the bon. Gentleman intends a reference to the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not answer my second question, about arm's-length relationships, where someone might have an interest in another company.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is my Cox and Box act. I shall answer the hon. Gentleman's question when I reach the piece of paper which I trust my worthy officials will give me so that I can answer with a sense of security.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Thurrock referred to a whole series of prospectuses that I have not had the privilege of seeing. She legitimately said that many of them were private prospectuses. I have great difficulty in addressing myself to her point. The delineation of what should or should not be included in the scheme is clear. The nature of passive, non-trading activities, and the way in which we have now allowed R and D to come in to offset that, was a prime limitation, but it was a limitation in relation to risks.<br><br>
The other limitations that we have introduced in the past two years—last year on farming and this year on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 348</span>
property—show the Government's concern that when risk is not attached commensurate with the relief associated with the £40,000 limit and the many major opportunities of the individual, no further limitations should be applied.<br><br>
It is very peculiar to hear people describe as utterly disgraceful investments in nursing homes for the elderly and the physically and mentally handicapped. I do not want to develop the point much further, but I find it bizarre that such investment—however we achieve it—can be so regarded in a democratic society. There is no way in which the Government would seek to limit it.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Workington asked particularly about "arm's length". Investors will not be able to obtain relief under the scheme for investing in the original land for buildings. I shall be happy to come back to the hon. Gentleman if he has difficulties on other points.<br><br>
While the Opposition have expressed some anxiety about what they saw as difficulties in the schemes, they seemed to welcome the exclusion of property companies and the inclusion of R and D. I imagine, therefore, that they wish the clause to stand part of the Bill.</span></p>

I tabled the amendment more out of honour than for any other reason. As the Financial Secretary knows, I have an affinity with the clause because it was born in the heady days when the Finance Bill of 1978 was in Committee and when the Lib-Lab pact was in operation. It has never looked back.<br><br>
I wished to take this opportunity to welcome the Government's proposals. I am sure that it is widely recognised that they are making a positive and beneficial change. I like to try to keep my party slightly ahead of the Government in these matters because we have to pay special attention to the need for profit-sharing and wider share ownership generally.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0715">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 349</span>
I realise that the scheme has developed considerably since its inception in 1978 and I appreciate that by chopping and changing such provisions too regularly, the necessary complicated rules for implementing the scheme can become difficult for employers and employees to interpret. However, there is a case for continuing to maintain the momentum. The approved profit-sharing schemes still have vast untapped potential in the United Kingdom. We should continue to look for ways of making the schemes more attractive to employers and employees.<br><br>
This is merely a probing amendment. It is not a serious attempt to change the legislation, but is designed to keep the pressure on the Government to provide and investigate ways of developing the scheme further. The Financial Secretary might be able to give some information about the possibility of increasing the take-up in schemes if some of the changes in the amendment were to be implemented and he might be able to say whether that would affect the number of schemes that might come on stream. However, I merely ask the Committee to consider the question on the basis that the Government will actually and continuously keep under review methods of development of approved share option schemes and that they will keep future Finance Bill Committees appraised of developments. I believe that there is common interest throughout the Committee to try to develop the scheme as far and as fast as we can.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I thank the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) on the way in which he moved the amendment and especially for his clear endorsement of the scheme and his recognition of the way in which the clause underlying his amendment seeks to improve the basic working of the scheme.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, the purpose of the clause is to increase the appeal of approved profit sharing schemes to employees and employers alike by bringing forward from seven to five years the "release date" after which shares can be disposed of without income tax liability. But, at the same time, Ministers are concerned that employees should still be encouraged to hold on to their shares for a reasonable period. They see no case for extending the clause to make it easier for employees to sell their shares under the schemes any sooner than five years. Most of the surveys and studies that have been carried out showed that the longer the retention, the more likely it is to be almost permanent.<br><br>
On the other hand, the effect of the amendment would be that employees participating in the Finance Act 1978 approved profit-sharing scheme who sold their shares at the first opportunity (as soon as the second anniversary of allocation was reached) would be liable to pay income tax on only 50 per cent. of the sale proceeds. The Government do not believe that such a relaxation would further the cause of wider share ownership or would serve the other important purposes of the approved profit-sharing scheme legislation which sought to improve on more than a short-term basis employees' motivation and involvement in their firms. On the contrary, the amendment could lead to abuse of the tax relief as employees would have to wait for only two years to sell their shares
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 350</span>
although their tax bill would be halved.<br><br>
Under the existing legislation, employees must hold their shares for at least four years before the income tax charged on the initial value of the shares sold is reduced from 100 per cent. to 75 per cent. The Government judge that the balance is about right. I recognise that the hon. Gentleman welcomes the overall scheme, but I think that he will appreciate that his amendment might not support the basic thrust of that scheme. On that basis, I hope that I can persuade him to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 155, in page 43, line 28, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(6) At the end of paragraph 6 of Schedule 9 to that Act there shall be added "or (c) shares in a co-operative society that are redeemable.".'.</p></blockquote>
The wording of the amendment is identical to a new clause which I move during the proceedings on the Finance Bill a year ago. On that occasion we were in the closing stages and I think that the debate took place at about 2.30 am. I hope that it will not take so long on this occasion, especially as I hope to persuade the Financial Secretary to accept the amendment.<br><br>
The amendment can popularly be described as the Paul Derrick amendment because Mr. Derrick has been closely associated with the proposal on several occasions. I pay tribute to the way in which he briefed me both last and this year and for the campaign that he has waged against the Financial Secretary in the intervening 12 months. His sheer persistence must bring its own reward and I am sure that the Financial Secretary will accept the amendment.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) said on the previous amendment, the whole scheme was introduced in 1978 by the Labour Government with the support of the Liberal party. On several occasions in recent years, it has been suggested that the benefit of the scheme should be extended to include industrial or workers' cooperatives. Perhaps I should declare a personal interest in that I am joint secretary of the all-party group for industrial common ownership.<br><br>
At present, it is not possible for a workers' co-operative to issue shares and attain the advantages of existing legislation. The reason lies in the so-called redeemability of shares in the co-operative. Although the shares issued to employees are described as irredeemable, they can be disposed of. Clause 43 will reduce the period after which those shares can be sold. In a real sense, it is possible for employees to redeem their shares. They can enjoy the benefit of those shares, but they do not redeem them from the company. They sell them on the open market.<br><br>
When the provision was introduced seven years ago, it was necessary for an employee to hold the shares for 10 years before disposal. Only if the employee held the shares for 10 years could he or she be exempt from tax.<br><br>
The Conservative Government not only increased the limit on the value of the shares from £500 to £1,250,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0716">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 351</span>
but reduced the period after which shares could be sold from 10 years to seven. This evening, we are considering a provision which will reduce the period from seven years to five years.<br><br>
Shares issued in a co-operative are, in theory, redeemable from the time of issue. They could be redeemed in a period of months, in the sense that the employee who has a share in the co-operative of which he is a part owner can redeem his shares at any time.<br><br>
I appreciate that an employee could redeem his shares within a matter of months of issue, but in practice someone involved in a workers' co-operative will not redeem his or her shares until the connection with the co-operative is terminated. That termination usually involves the death or retirement of the worker. It is possible for someone to leave a co-operative and take some other form of employment or economic activity to make a living, but it is fair to say that overwhelmingly people who terminate their connection with a workers' co-operative usually do so on retirement or death. It is only at that point that the shares can be redeemed—that is the essence of a co-operative.<br><br>
It is therefore reasonable that this provision should be extended to co-operatives. After all, the motive behind the 1978 provision, which was endorsed by the present Government and the former Government, was to encourage employees or workers in a co-operative to identify with the employer or economic enterprise in which they were engaged. That is the essence of a workers' co-operative.<br><br>
I would argue that it is inherent in the nature of the provision that it should be extended to workers' co-operatives as well as to those companies which we would describe loosely as capitalist companies, to which it now extends.<br><br>
When I put forward those arguments last year to the Financial Secretary, whom I believe will reply to the debate this morning, he was kind enough to say that he would give serious consideration to my arguments. On report, the Financial Secretary explained that he had not had time to give serious consideration to my arguments. I accept that point and I am in no way cavilling about that because it was only a short period between the end of the Committee proceedings and report. However, nearly 12 months have passed and I hope that the Financial Secretary will give us the benefit of his consideration this morning.<br><br>
If the Financial Secretary will not accept the amendment, will he explain in detail why he is unwilling to accept it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I start by endorsing every word that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) said about Paul Derrick. I made comments in last year's debate about him and I am only too delighted to reiterate them. While he and I may have disagreed in our correspondence there has been no more persistent or ardent pursuer of a cause, and the way in which he has pursued it should be a lesson to many. If it is not too difficult for the hon. Member for Hodge Hill, I shall say, as I said at the beginning of last year's debate, there are few people who have argued with such advocacy for the views, legitimate views in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 352</span>
many ways, of the co-operative movement than he has.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman was right when he said that we will recall last year's debates. We debated the topic of industrial co-operatives and the profit sharing legislation in the new clause tabled by the Hon. Member for Hodge Hill. At the end of that debate I promised that Ministers would look with great care at the possibility of a Government amendment on the lines envisaged by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
12.15 am<br><br>
We seriously considered the matter with the assistance and involvement of the Inland Revenue and others, but eventually decided that it would not be appropriate to make such changes in the 1978 legislation. That is not a perjorative comment about the co-operative movement. I shall explain in detail why we took that decision because the issue merits it.<br><br>
I wrote to the hon. Member for Hodge Hill in April explaining the Government's reasons for that decision. Those hon. Members who were on the Finance Bill Committee in 1984 will have received copies of my letter. I am sure that all hon. Members would like me to put the Government's position on record.<br><br>
As the 1978 legislation stands, the shares used in an approved profit sharing scheme must not be redeemable. Redeemable shares have much of the character of a post-dated cheque, as the hon. Member for Hodge Hill recognised, and Ministers of successive Governments have taken the view that such shares would not properly serve the purposes of the profit-sharing legislation.<br><br>
I would accept that one of the purposes of that legislation would be served by co-operatives using redeemable shares—namely, to give employees rewards for past performance and an incentive to earn further such rewards. I place that important recognition on the record. But if that was adequate justification for tax relief—this is one of the problems—there would be no reason in equity to deny similar tax relief to all manner of employee incentive or bonus payments—cash as well as shares, deferred or immediate, profit-related or otherwise. That could be a major slippery slope towards large and unproductive expenditures of tax relief. That is not a pejorative comment on the legitimate argument about industrial co-operatives which the hon. Member for Hodge Hill seeks to make.<br><br>
The 1978 relief also seeks to encourage employees to greater efforts to increase the value of their stake in the enterprise for which they work. Redeemable shares will rarely increase in value and in the case of co-operative shares, dividends are usually limited to a low figure.<br><br>
Redeemable shares in a co-operative, therefore, carry very little equity interest capable of enhancement by increased effort. Allocations of such shares are in many ways comparable to deferred cash payments. The involvement and motivation of co-operative employees is in any case already assured by the very nature of the enterprise. That is one of the problems. The relationship between employer and employee is already a particularly close one.<br><br>
Therefore, it seems very doubtful whether cooperative employees would be more greatly motivated by shares redeemable after five or more years—which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0717">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 353</span>
is not dissimilar to tax-relieved delayed cash—than by immediate wage increases or cash bonuses, albeit subject to tax.<br><br>
Other important purposes of the 1978 legislation are also relevant. The legislation encourages the sharing of profits between shareholders and workers and promotes wider share ownership. But the workers in a co-operative are the shareholders, and it is an odd notion that they should be encouraged to share profits with themselves. Secondly, wider share ownership refers to ordinary equity shares. As the hon. Member for Hodge Hill recognised, redeemable shares are outside the mainstream, especially co-operative redeemable shares, which must be surrendered when employment ends.<br><br>
It has been suggested that the 1978 legislation treats co-operatives inequitably, compared with conventional companies, by its insistence on the use of irredeemable shares. But co-operatives are not expressly or deliberately discriminated against. It has always been acknowledged that many other types of enterprise, too, cannot use the legislation, such as partnerships, public sector firms and so on, and in a previous debate in Committee, the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) made a stirring speech on that point. However, it is most unlikely that co-operatives suffer any competitive disadvantage on that score.<br><br>
Another argument which is advanced is that co-operatives need the assistance as a means of retaining their profits within their enterprise. They are impeded from doing so at present, because the issue of bonus shares outside the ambit of an approved profit sharing scheme gives rise to a schedule E income tax liability on the employees who receive the shares. The profit-sharing legislation is not intended as a means of easing enterprises' financing problems. Furthermore, in the context of the use of redeemable shares by co-operatives, it would assist only temporarily, until the shares had to be redeemed.<br><br>
I draw the attention of the hon. Member for Hodge Hill to a number of technical difficulties that arise from the amendment. The precise definition to be used of the type of co-operative to benefit from the consession would raise a particular difficulty. As the hon. Gentleman knows better than most, the nature of co-operatives varies widely. Also, there are certain conflicts between the profit-sharing rules in the 1978 legislation and the normal rules of co-operatives registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965, in matters such as restrictions on holders of co-operative shares and limits on holdings of such shares, for example. Those comments may be helpful to the hon. Member for Hodge Hill, as I know that he has a continuing interest in the subject.<br><br>
The Government are sympathetic to the cooperative ideal, but we believe that the amendment is not the way to give substance to that sympathy. It is right to draw the line, for the purposes of profit-sharing schemes, at irredeemable shares rather than to extend the legislation in a manner that would alter fundamentally the purposes that it is designed to serve. Much as I would like to find a suitable route, I do not believe that it lies within the 1978 profit-sharing scheme. Therefore I ask the hon. Gentleman to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 354</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have every intention of keeping my remarks brief. But I am sure that the Financial Secretary will understand that I am disappointed by his reply. I accept entirely that he has considered the matter most carefully and that there have been discussions between his officials and Mr. Derrick, and so on.<br><br>
When the Finance Bill was published we were very disappointed, as we had thought that we had made some progress in the past 12 months. I understand the Minister's argument about a slippery-slope, but to some extent we are already on one; the concession has already been made. I cannot see why we should not extend it to industrial co-operatives. He said, fairly, that the measure was introduced to encourage an increasing stake by employees in the company where they work and that there is no enhancement of the co-operator's share in the enterprise, but that is not strictly correct; I believe that there is an enhancement.<br><br>
Indeed, some problems faced by successful cooperatives flow from that. A few years ago there was the well-known case of Bristol Printers. One reason why that company was wound up was that the shares had become extraordinarily expensive by comparison with their "face value". A £1 share was worth many times that figure, but it could be redeemed only by the closure and winding up of the co-operative enterprise. It is folly that someone cannot obtain his stake in an enterprise because of such a restriction.<br><br>
The Minister also said that there is a close relationship between people working in a co-operative and the enterprise, which is true. But there is no reason why we should not do everything that we can to encourage an even closer relationship and identification. Again, he said that the scheme was introduced to promote wider share ownership, but I disagree with him. Having studied the subject, I believe that it was designed to encourage not wider share ownership but a closer identification of employees with the body that employs them—I use that phrase very loosely in respect of a co-operative.<br><br>
The measure was introduced by the Labour party and the Liberal party together, as we wanted to encourage a closer identification of employees with their economic activity. If wider share ownership has now become the objective, clearly there has been a sea change in the scheme. The Minister said that other types of enterprise cannot benefit from the measure, which I accept. I do not wish to tease him, but I must remind him that at a time when the Conservatives were in Opposition they tabled an amendment which would have extended the benefits of the scheme much wider than I would have wished; they would have included all sorts of other economic activities. Indeed, no less a person than the present Chancellor of the Exchequer spoke in favour of that extension. He back-tracked a little when he heard the compelling arguments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Major <span class='memberconstituency'>(Huntingdon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Labour Government accepted the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My goodness, not only are we having sedentary interventions, but even those who are paid to keep quiet are being provoked into speaking.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0718">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 355</span>
However, if the hon. Member for Huntingdon reads the record, he will see that the present Chancellor of the Exchequer advocated an extension that would have included other economic activities as well as co-operatives, although industrial co-operatives would have been included. Conservative Members even voted for that amendment. The Financial Secretary will no doubt reply that they voted with reservations, but they voted, and it is votes that count.<br><br>
I accept that co-operatives are not adversely affected in a co-operative sense. I do not suggest that the provision should be extended to include industrial co-operatives because they are losing out in competition with other economic enterprises. That is not our motive. We seek to give people working in industrial co-operatives the opportunity to increase their shareholding in the co-operatives. They cannot do that any other way except through the issue of so-called bonus shares. That is the only way in which they can increase their individual shareholding as opposed to their collective shareholding through the natural enhancement of retained profits. The Financial Secretary says that the retention of earnings is not a problem for co-operatives, but it is. One of my motives, although not the principal one, relates to the benefits that would arise if only we could persuade the Government to accept the amendment.<br><br>
The scheme may not have been designed originally to arrange for the retention of profits or earnings by economic enterprises, but that would be one advantage for industrial co-operatives. The Financial Secretary is right in saying that co-operatives vary widely, but that is not a problem. If he accepted our amendment, I feel sure that we would be able to agree a definition of co-operatives. There are plenty of definitions scattered throughout other legislation and we can easily refer to one. I should be happy to leave it to the Registrar of Friendly Societies to decide for the moment which body may legitimately be described as a co-operative.<br><br>
We need not spend more time discussing it. I accept that the Financial Secretary has considered the matter carefully and that he has formed an opinion that differs from mine. But, as the Conservative party voted on its much wider amendment some years ago, so tonight I will ask my hon. Friends to vote with me on the amendment. This matter will not go away. Each year we will table the amendment until the year comes when one of us will sit on the Treasury Benches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with some of the ideas of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) about a scheme which, as he said, was introduced by the Labour Government in 1978.<br><br>
The notion of creating a closer link between employees and the co-operative is laudable and should be encouraged. The Minister has spoken of some of the technical difficulties. I appreciate the problems of definitions and other matters, but I do not believe that they are insurmountable. At the end of the day, it is a question of the priority that we allow.<br><br>
I am not impressed by the slippery slope theory. The Government are worried about which other schemes would benefit, but so what? Let us consider their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 356</span>
merits. Last week, the Committee scrapped development land tax, which lost £50 million. Why could we not give that to co-operatives? It is a question of priorities, and we are disappointed that the Minister has not taken the opportunity to give priority to the co-operatives in such a way as to build up the relationship between their shareholders and the company. That is sad. I hope that next year we shall press the matter again.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clause is designed to plug yet another loophole in the deep discount securities legislation where a deep discount security is one carrying a nil or low rate of interest which is issued at a substantial discount. The issuer claims the tax deduction for the interest deemed to accrue each year but the investor has to pay tax only on the so-called profit when he sells the security or when it matures. Of late, three kinds of loophole have arisen from the United States. I cannot resist quoting their names. They are CATS, TIGRs and STRIPS, which are methods of investing in American Government securities. CATS are the certificates of accrual and Treasury Securities; TIGRs are the Treasury investment growth receipts, and STRIPS, the latest scheme, is designed to facilitate the separate trading of registered interest and principal of securities.<br><br>
Nor can I resist mentioning what the Secretary of the Treasury, Donald Regan, said when he announced a new programme to facilitate those schemes. He said that
<br><blockquote><p>"the STRIPS program exemplifies the basic public debt management and free market philosophy of this Administration. It reduces the cost to the government of financing the public debt by facilitating competitive private market initiatives with a minimum of direct government involvement."</p></blockquote>

The Americans are trying to bequeath their budget deficit to us by allowing attractive methods—from the American point of view—for British investors to obtain tax relief to which the British Government obviously do not wish them to be intitled by investing in American Government securities in order to assist with the American budget deficit. I think that the Minister will agree that that is correct.<br><br>
However, the Government obviously think that the Americans should keep their budget deficit to themselves or, at least, that the British taxpayer should not have to fork out unnecessary tax reliefs for British investors wishing to participate in any of the schemes for which companies have been set up, especially in the United States, which are designed to market such coupons.<br><br>
I ask the Minister a couple of questions on this point. Of course, we do not disapprove of the principal objective of the clause but a question arises about the effectiveness of this legislation. There are various ways in which structures could be devised so that companies or individuals would not be caught. For example, company A which issues the deep discount securities has as its sole asset shares which are not relevant securities in company B, which then acquires the relevant securities. It is not clear whether the proposed legislation would catch that sort of possibility.<br><br>
There may be other planning opportunities, as they would be described by those marketing them, available for investment in CATS and TIGRs rather than directly in the underlying securities. The first is that any profit arising on the acquisition and subsequent sale of a right to receive interest would almost certainly be assessable for capital gains tax, and in significant transactions there is a risk that case I might apply. Such a right is not a deep discount bond, nor is it within the bond-washing legislation. It is probably not a security, but if it were it would not be a relevant security as it seems to fall within the exception for redeemable securities with no return other than a premium on redemption. Therefore, the purchase of a right of that kind might be one possible way of investing in CATS and TIGRs so as to avoid the proposed legislation.<br><br>
On the other hand, a right to receive principal could well be a relevant security as those rights are commonly sold together with the right to receive the last few interest payments. Any increase in the value of the right to receive principal when realised will be taxable as a capital gain. The bond-washing provisions would clearly apply to transfers during periods for which the entitlement to interest has not been sold separately. It seems that they might also apply to periods for which the entitlement to interest has been sold separately as any such sales would be a transfer without accrued interest.<br><br>
There are problems about the interpretation of existing legislation as it applies to the planning opportunties that I have just outlined. However, our main concern is that the objectives of the clause should be fulfilled and that the proposed legisation to prevent those unnecessary and undesirable ways of obtaining tax relief should achieve the objective which the Government have set.<br><br>
I do not necessarily expect the Minister to reply immediately to the points I have made, but we would like to be assured by Report that the aims of the clause
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 358</span>
will be carried out and that those forms of investment in the American public sector debt should not be made at the unnecessary expense of the British taxpayer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for the welcome which she has given to the clause. As she recognised, the deep discount provisions that we introduced last year, which I am glad to say have now been made avail of by a number of companies, were designed for corporate bonds. The effect of clause 44 and schedule 9 is to disapply the deep discount rules to cases of coupon stripping by the artificial creation of zero coupon bonds by separating each individual coupon and the capital amount of the bond into separate securities.<br><br>
We want to ensure that the provisions achieve their objective.<br><br>
There is a slightly different regime in the United States. Not only do people there give rather fanciful names to these weird animals and others which they create, but they have taxation on an accruals basis for deep discount, so it is not entirely parallel. It would not be right for the Revenue to suffer from the conversions of orthodox fixed interest stocks. I have taken careful note of what the hon. Lady has said. We have included provisions in schedule 9(1)(2) about intermediaries.<br><br>
This is a measure designed to deal with the imposition of company B as well as company A between the purchaser and the original security. There are also provisions in subsection (3) which deal with conversions. I am not sure whether technically all the devices can be set off. However, in the light of comments put forward since the clause and schedule were published, I had intended to review the matter between publication and Report stage to ensure that there were no obvious means of exploiting this problem which must be corrected. I shall take the hon. Lady's comments into account.<br><br>
Existing tax legislation —for example, section 470 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 — could help in the second of the cases which the hon. Lady described. However, I must look at them. These are not matters on which one could attempt to give an authoritative answer off the top of one's head. I am glad that the hon. Lady approves of the purpose of the clause. The Government intend that it should be effective, and so we shall consider any possible ways round that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his remarks. I have one further question about the loophole. How much money have the Government lost in the past financial year by not stopping up the loophole in the first place?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The issue of zero coupons, or the creation of coupon stripped bonds in this way, has not got under way in this country. Several provisional inquiries into how it should be done have been undertaken, but the idea was to prevent it before it developed.</span></p>

PARTNERSHIPS: BASIS OF ASSESSMENT.</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>12.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause is an anti-avoidance clause, and as such we welcome it in principle. However, we should draw the Committee's attention to the scale of the problem that has occurred in relation to partnerships. The latest figures, which are several years out of date, suggest that about 457,000 people are in partnerships — an immense amount. Most of them are in partnerships of three people or under.<br><br>
The Public Accounts Committee's sixth report of 1978 and its eighth report in 1980 drew attention to the fact that considerable tax avoidance was occurring under the guise of changes in partnership. The Public Accounts Committee found that, in a selection of 13 partnerships which it took as a basic sample, some £12 million or 23 per cent. of actual profit was being subject to avoidance schemes. It found that overall some £30 million a year was lost in that way to the Inland Revenue.<br><br>
The sixth report in 1978 said that within one or two years there should be an attempt to deal with this problem, and the eighth report in 1980 said that there was no further reason why it should be delayed. Will the Chief Secretary say why legislation to implement anti-avoidance provisions to deal with this problem has not been introduced before 1985, and how much money has been lost since 1980 because of failure to take action.<br><br>
The Government are ready to take action to deal with social security frauds, and frauds of this nature. We wonder whether, if the same vigour were applied to anti-avoidance provisions where considerable sums of money are involved we should have more for those necessary social security payments.<br><br>
It is not as if the anti-avoidance scheme being used is particularly complicated. Under section 154 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970, when a partner dies or leaves or the nature of the partnership changes for any reason, it ceases. The new partnership may contain some new people but an election is provided for under section 154(2) to continue along the lines of the same partnership, which is the normal course of events.<br><br>
Where no election was held to continue the partnership — although it could have been held because one or more of the people in the partnership were the same — and a new partnership came into being, it was taxed under schedule D on the basis of the preceding year. In tax avoidance circles it was called a five-year plan and a new or five-year circle. A partnership would begin again, but the results would be manoeuvred so that there were low profits in the first year. The next two years would then be done on the basis of the first year because they were taxed on the preceding year. So for the first three years the partners would be taxed on the first year's profits. It would be only in the fourth, fifth or sixth years that there would be taxation on a realistic basis.<br><br>
A particular development of that scheme was that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 360</span>
work in progress might be sold from the old partnership to the new partnership. The sale price would then represent the deduction from first-year profits to the new partnership. It would represent post-cessation receipts for the old partnership, so they could be gaining both ways. As many partnerships are set up so that different branch officers are in different partnerships, we can see how easy it was to operate.<br><br>
Clause 45 means that for four years partnerships are treated on the basis of the year of assessment. However, I should like the Chief Secretary to say why other aspects of the basic anti-avoidance scheme are not dealt with in clause 45. For example, we are not dealing with where a partner leaves and there is in effect a new partnership, and the question is whether to hold an election under section 154(2). Even when a genuine new partnership is set up for the first time it is still possible to restrict first-year profits and artificially to depress profits for the next two years. The five-year plan or cycle can still work at least once.<br><br>
Secondly, even if the period is increased to four years on an actual basis, as provided under new section 116, an eight-year cycle is still possible. Will the Chief Secretary confirm that the tax avoidance scheme now blocked on a five-year basis can still work on an eight-year basis?<br><br>
Moreover, a company that needs raw materials for a manufacturing process may set up a partnership to supply them. It may arrange only a few sales during the first year to depress profits in its first year of assessment. In the second and third years it is in effect assessed on the first year's profits. That is another way of artificially depressing profits. A partner may employ someone. In the first year the partner will pay tax on the partnership profits. In the second year the employee may become a partner and both partners will pay tax on the original, sole partner's profits.<br><br>
I hope that the Chief Secretary understands my points. The Public Accounts Committee said that the anti-avoidance scheme that we are discussing was on a much broader basis than that dealt with in clause 45. There are still areas of difficulty.<br><br>
Some partnerships are set up and managed to restrict their first-year profits so that, on a preceding-year basis, they are assessed for three years on small profits taken from the first year. I wish to contrast such partnerships with those operating under the enterprise allowance scheme, which benefits the poorer off. Many of my constituents have used it. The scheme pays £40 a week—£2,000 a year—which is treated as a receipt of the business and part of the profits.<br><br>
A partner operating under the enterprise allowance scheme has that £2,000 built into his profits. For the second and third years he will be taxed under the normal schedule D rules. He will pay tax on the £2,000 for the first, second and third years. By then, £6,000 is treated as profits over three years so the scheme becomes more like a loan. [<i>Interruption.</i>] If the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) can tell me why I am wrong I shall be grateful</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is always intervening from a sedentary position.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 361</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, it has taken us a long time to draft such anti-avoidance provisions. Secondly, large areas of avoidance have still not been covered. Thirdly, the Government should give serious consideration to the problems that arise under the enterprise allowance scheme. I do not expect the Chief Secretary to give me a categorical answer—it would be absurd to expect that—but I hope that he will look at the points I made about the scheme to see if there is some justification in what I said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Rees)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to respond as succinctly to the points made by The hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) as he made them. Certainly, it is true that it has taken a considerable time to come to grips with this problem, but some of the possiblities were appreciated before the Public Accounts Committee first drew attention to the matter in 1978–79. I think it is fair to infer, therefore, the the Hon. Labour Government were equally aware of the difficulties, not of identifying the problem of finding a close and accurately targetted solution to it.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman demonstrated that it might be possible to run on, over a more extended period, some facets of the scheme to which he drew attention. I do not want to call it a scheme. It derives from the inevitable mismatch between the profits of a business: Candidly, the only way to achieve a total coincidence of the two would be to put businesses, professions and vocations on a current year basis. However, with his acute knowledge of these matters the hon. Gentleman will realise that that would raise many difficult problems and open a much wider debate, involving more extensive and more difficult legislation. So any particular route will have difficulties.<br><br>
We shall keep the matter under review. I readily admit that it is quite possible to run on a firm's accounts over a period of four years, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, although one often finds that what sounds theoretically easy, practice bristles with real problems. Nothing is forecast as easily in the real world of commerce as outside commentators are apt to say.<br><br>
I accept that there have been difficulties. No doubt those difficulties engaged the attention of previous Labour Administrations, and they did not find a solution. We had a long process of consultation, in which there was a wide variety of views on how best to proceed. I hope that what we produced is a fairly comprehensible, sennsible and practical way of dealing with the problem, but our mind is not closed to other methods.<br><br>
As I said the fundamental problem is how to achieve a coincidence between commercial profits and profits for tax purposes. The idea that one can readily move to a current year basis throughout the life of an individual or a partnership bristles with problems, as the hon. Gentleman will be the first to appreciate.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also drew attention to the enterprise allowance. He overlooked a fundamental point. The enterprise allowance, as such, would be treated as a gross receipt, and therefore the expenses of the business would be offset against it to arrive at the actual profit. It is only on the basis that the enterprise allowance was equivalent to the net profits of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 362</span>
business that the disadvantages to which the hon. Gentleman drew attention would accrue, and I very much doubt whether in practice there would be quite such an extreme case as the one that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.<br><br>
I am happy to look at the matter with an open mind. It would clearly not be the Committee's intention that people should be severely disadvantaged, because we all want people to take full advantage of enterprise allowances and to form viable, continuing and prosperous businesses. So we shall look at the problem, but as the enterprise allowance will be treated as a gross receipt, and not as equivalent to net profits, I doubt whether the consequences will be quite as damaging as the hon. Gentleman said. I fully appreciate what he said, but I hope that the Committee will feel able to accept the clause, even though some hon. Members may feel that the remedy has been slightly long in arriving.</span></p>
<p>1 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is correct that the enterprise allowance will be treated as a gross receipt, but the expenses of the business would be incurred anyway. The £2,000 is a starting point that is unavoidable for the enterprise allowance applicant or recipient. That does not occur with the ordinary partnership, and that worries us.<br><br>
Secondly, although I am not saying that we should move to a current year basis, there is all the difference in the world between having a preceding year basis but ensuring that profits attained in the first year are genuine profits and artificially deflated profits to provide scope for greater tax avoidance.<br><br>
I accept that there is an argument about the Committee of Public Accounts report, but the Committee's figures since 1980, which have not been challenged, show that about £150 million has gone astray through tax avoidance. That is a figure that we should bear in mind at a time when we are discussing social security reviews.<br><br>
We should compare the sums that have gone astray to the payments that have been cut from those who need them.</span></p>

LIMITED PARTNERS: RESTRICTION OF RELIEFS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>On proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief as members of the Committee, I am sure wish to go home. I have some slight difficulty over my own reception as I have just discovered that I have left my front door key at home.<br><br>
Clause 46 is another anti-avoidance clause, and it is welcome. I lay no particular party political blame, but it is scandalous that the anti-avoidance provisions in clause 46 should have been so long in arriving. The limited partner scheme was pretty drastic. As I understand it, Mr X would put £10,000 into a business as a limited partner; the partnership would make a loss much bigger than the £10,000 and the loss would be distributed among the partners. If £50,000 per partner
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0722">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 363</span>
were lost, Mr. X would end with a first-year allowance loss of some £50,000, which could then be used as a set off.<br><br>
As a method of avoiding tax it was both simple and extremely anti-social and was used particularly by motion picture companies although I am not sure why.<br><br>
I welcome the clause but I wish to ask the Chief Secretary a question about tax avoidance. How far do the Treasury and the Inland Revenue think that they have still to go in fighting anti-avoidance schemes? I believe that new schemes come into being at a considerable rate, including a curious scheme called the pure endowment term assurance avoidance scheme. I shall not delay the Committee by explaining the scheme tonight, but it apparently involves the avoidance of capital transfer tax on a massive scale. I think that the Committee and Parliament should deal with these tax avoidance schemes urgently. Tax avoidance is not illegal; it is not tax evasion, but it is highly anti-social, and those who avoid tax through these schemes are cutting down the money available for our social welfare needs. How far is there still to go? Clauses 45 and 46 introduce anti-avoidance provisions that are fairly easy to introduce but they have been a long time in coming. If tax avoidance were taken even more seriously, perhaps more money would come into the Revenue and the benefits could be distributed more equitably.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I start by offering my respectful condolences to the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) on the loss of his keys. I hope that he will not be seriously inconvenienced. I shall do my best not to prolong his agony.<br><br>
Uncharacteristically, the hon. Gentleman described the clause as nothing short of a scandal. The basis for the clause was a decision in the Court of Appeal in the case of Reed v. Young. Until then the Revenue had taken the firm view, and had been so advised by its legal advisers, that such schemes were nothing like as simple or as successful as the hon. Gentleman has endeavoured to outline. The Inland Revenue is taking the case to appeal in the House of Lords and its original view may be vindicated, but it is not for me to anticipate the outcome. As it may take quite a time and as the possibilities of exploitation are considerable, we thought it right to present the clause to the House of Commons and to the Committee.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sedgefield broadened his observations and asked what the Revenue felt about these matters and whether it was being sufficiently prompt. Those who have scrutinised Finance Bills presented by this Administration since 1979 must surely recognise that we have been very ready and prompt to introduce a wide range of anti-avoidance measures. Furthermore, the Committee will be aware that the Revenue won in litigatory terms a notable victory in the case of Furniss v. Dawson, which has fundamentally altered this branch of law, although the full implications have yet to be explored. If the hon. Gentleman feels that any particular schemes cause a considerable loss of revenue, we shall be ready to consider them.<br><br>
I commend the clause to the Committee and I hope that you will permit us, Miss Fookes, to take schedule
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 364</span>
10 next on the basis that even if the House of Lords were to find in favour of the Inland Revenue, the provisions will staunch a considerable loss of revenue. As the hon. Gentleman raised the point, we hope that it may save as much as £30 million in a full year. It is a matter of speculation how many people would have embarked on such schemes had we not introduced these provisions. For good measure, I add that there are no additional staff costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Chief Secretary for his reply, but £30 million is the measure of the problem. The case of Furniss v. Dawson was obviously a landmark in revenue case law, although it is a pity that it had to be left to the courts for such a long time to do what should be Parliament's own work.<br><br>
I mentioned the pure endowment term assurance scheme as an example of tax avoidance and I shall write to the Chief Secretary about it as I should not be in order if I were to detain the Committee on that matter now.</span></p>

LIMITED PARTNERS: RESTRICTION OF RELIEFS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Tenth Schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) has just made about the case of Furniss v. Dawson is absurd. The idea that Parliament could reach the general conclusion that the House of Lords reached on tax avoidance is nonsense. The difficulty with such legislation is the amount that it adds to the statute book but schedule 10 adds only two pages.<br><br>
Can my right hon. and learned Friend say why paragraph 3 is necessary? Why is it necessary to deal with companies as limited partners? The Institute of Chartered Accountants' submission says that limited partnerships set up for genuine commercial reasons will suffer as a result of this aspect of the schedule because such partnerships have been established because of the unsatisfactory nature of consortium relief and because of a desire not to be locked into the inflexibility of a corporate entity. Every time that we accede to a Revenue request for anti-avoidance legislation—in this instance it is not even clear that it is necessary as the House of Lords has yet to reach a decision—we run the risk, because of the way in which the Inland Revenue approaches these matters, of excluding genuine commercial transactions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to detain the Committee. However, I shall take up the remarks of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), who tends to become a little extravagant in his language at a late hour of the night. There is nothing absurd about saying that Parliament could have legislated for Furniss v. Dawson, which laid down a general principle on how to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0723">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 365</span>
approach revenue statutes. There is no reason why Parliament should not do that. Indeed, it does so in many other areas of the law. It lays down general principles and there is no reason why it should not do so. I said at the very beginning that I did not intend to make a party political point. I explained that I wished merely to draw attention to the fact, which we should do 'in Parliament, that there are many avoidance schemes. The hon. Member would be better off if he were to bend his energies and attentions to destroying avoidance schemes rather than attempting to protect them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether it would be appropriate for me to enter into what has become an interesting but private debate between the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) and my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). I only say that I am not so confident that it will be easy to draft a general provision in quite the way that the House of Lords determined Furniss v. Dawson. Indeed, it may be a matter of debate precisely what the House of Lords determined in that area.<br><br>
As a general proposition, I should have thought that it is for Parliament to legislate but for the courts to elucidate. If, on mature reflection, the House of Commons finds what the courts determine to be unattractive or inconsistent with the general flow of policy, there is obviously a case for amending legislation. However, to imagine that the House should always anticipate the decision of the courts in any sensitive area like this would be a misuse of the House's role and would also be destructive of the position of the courts.<br><br>
As for the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield put to me, it seemed to the Government and to the Inland Revenue that the possibilities for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 366</span>
avoidance would be just as great where the limited partner was an individual as where the limited partner was a corporate entity. On that basis, we felt it right to legislate for both possibilities. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield has deep knowledge and experience in many fiscal fields. If he cares to draw to our attention between now and the conclusion of the Bill's consideration in Committee any bona fide cases that might be prejudiced by the extension to the provision in paragraph 3, we shall certainly examine with an open mind whether it would be possible to temper and improve the provisions before Report.<br><br>
I always recognise the danger of overkill when one introduces an anti-avoidance provision. I am sure that Members on both sides of the Committee will recognise that the statute book is littered with provisions which were introduced with quite laudable intent but which, on reflection or, indeed, on development by the courts, have gone a good deal wider than was first conceived either by those who introduced it or by the Committee or the House of Commons which passed it.<br><br>
One must be extremely careful that anti-avoidance measures are fairly precisely targeted. However if my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield would like to draw our attention to the bona fide cases which he feels might be prejudiced, I shall certainly look at them and, if needs be, return with improvements to both the schedule and the clause on Report.</span></p>
