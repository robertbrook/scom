<p>8.47 p.m.</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We were discussing amendment No. 134 and the others grouped with it, and I was saying that clause 53 had our basic support. We were talking about the anti-avoidance provisions in subsections (3) and (4)<br><br>
There is a risk that people will attempt to accelerate the time of their claim and their obligation to pay, either by extending credit or by putting the obligation to pay at a date earlier than normal, so that they can get the allowance, even though the payment is not being made until later.<br><br>
The amendments tabled to subsection (3) concern a situation where credit is extended. The Government have taken the view that there must be a cut-off point whereby credit can be extended but only for a limited time: to go further than that limited time may involve avoidance. So the Government hit upon the three months provision.<br><br>
It was said earlier that the normal time for credit was about three months; that is why the Government have chosen the three months' time limit. That may be right as a broad generality, but difficulties arise when credit may quite genuinely be extended for a longer period. Is it right in such circumstances to impose rough justice under subsection (3)?<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Freeman) tabled an amendment to leave out three months and insert 12 months. One could argue a case for the period being six, nine or 12 months: it is a question of plucking a time out of the air. Because of the problems that that involves, I attempted to put the matter in a slightly different way. If the evil that we are hitting at in subsection (3) is credit being given on abnormally long terms to secure a taxation advantage, to specify a certain period may give rise to injustice. The majority of cases may fit within the three months, but others may not. It is perfectly normal commercial practice to have a credit period of six, seven or eight months, and in those cases the benefts will be lost. That is why I suggest that subsection (3) involves an element of rough justice.<br><br>
What worries some of my hon. Friends is that the normal credit period may be less than three months—perhaps 30 days. My commercial experience is that a normal commercial pattern is to issue invoices with a 30 days' credit limit. Subsection (3) allows credit to be given for up to three months, although 30 days may be the normal period, so some advantage, although perhaps minimal might be gained in that way.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 402</span>
I have no great, unyielding affection for the wording in amendment No. 196, but I do think that it is better not to aim for a specified period but to define one in reference to "normal commercial usage".<br><br>
That may be a difficult concept, but it is used in subsection (4), so a degree of symmetry is achieved. Thus parties would realise that they could not, put a credit date in an agreement artificially. Without gearing the payment to any specific period of time, we could provide that the parties acted according to "normal commercial usage".<br><br>
These are difficult and complicated provisions. The Financial Secretary may tell us that what we suggest is impracticable. But if we are to change the rules, it is important that we do so in as fair a way as possible—across the board. I am sure that is what we all wish.<br><br>
I ask the Financial Secretary to take account of the legitimate points that have been made about the credit terms that might be extended. The aim is to hit at tax avoidance, but in doing so, we must be careful not to provoke injustice.<br><br>
We have canvassed a broad range of arguments for the Financial Secretary, and I await his reply with interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) was very fair in the balanced way in which he examined the complicated interaction of the clause which seeks to give practical help to the taxpayer in a complex field. As he rightly said, the provision seeks at the same time to strike against avoidance.<br><br>
I appreciate the way in which the hon. Member and my hon. Friends the Members for Kettering (Mr. Freeman) and for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) spoke in a probing manner to this series of amendments. It is a complex area, and it is most important that we get clearly on the record the nature of the problems surrounding the new set of arrangements in the clause.<br><br>
May I remind the Committee of the purpose of clause 53, which follows extensive discussions between the Inland Revenue and representative bodies? It seeks to remove the doubts—as the hon. Member for Sedgefield said before dinner—that have been expressed about the date on which expenditure is incurred for capital allowance purposes. The date is important, as it may affect the timing of allowances and during the phasing out—the critical period—of first-year and initial allowances, their amount.<br><br>
On the Inland Revenue's view of the present law, before these changes, allowances become due when the purchaser of an asset is required to pay for it. However, under accountancy practice, which has generally been followed by accountants and others when compiling capital allowance computations, the expenditure has commonly been regarded as incurred when the obligation to meet it arises, that is when a firm debt comes into existence.<br><br>
The consultations with representative bodies, which were held in 1984, showed that there was no single, all-embracing, authoritative statement of the date when expenditure is to be treated as incurred for "normal accountancy purposes". That makes a simple solution very difficult to find. It may be, and commonly is, the date on which an invoice is issued, but other dates can be and are used, such as the date when the asset is delivered or the date when the invoice is received.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0746">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 403</span>
The approach adopted by clause 53 is to describe the date on which the obligation to pay the capital expenditure has a sufficient degree of certainty to require it to be reflected in business accounts. The clause, therefore, refers to the date on which the obligation to pay "becomes unconditional"—that is, the vendor will have completed his part of the contract and the purchaser's obligation to pay will be unconditional and absolute, though not necessarily immediate if the vendor is allowing a period of trade credit. I shall come to the period of credit later.<br><br>
This approach covers both expenditure before delivery, such as deposits and progress payments, and expenditure on or after delivery. With one exception, to which the hon. Member for Sedgfield referred—and I shall come back to it in a moment—it will mean that the date on which expenditure is incurred for capital allowance purposes will fall at the beginning of any trade credit, rather than at the end, which is the focal point of difference between accountancy practice and the Revenue's view of the law as it stood before this Bill.<br><br>
The one exception is where the period of trade credit exceeds three months. Here, the date for capital allowances will be the date or dates which are prescribed for payment by the contract. That will apply mainly to those contracts, likely to be in a small minority, where the asset has been delivered and the balance of the purchase price is payable in instalments, perhaps over several years. Just as he does now, the purchaser will receive his capital allowances for each of the years in which he is due to make the instalment payments.<br><br>
Amendment No. 134 stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering, who said that it was essentially a probing amendment. It would substitute the seemingly straightforward word "arises" for the present and admittedly more complicated Government formulation. On the face of it, that seems reasonable, because it reflects the language in which the point is commonly discussed. However, my advice is that my hon. Friend's amendment would, in fact, perpetuate the very uncertainty that clause 53 seeks to bring to an end. That is, it would remain very arguable that the key date for capital allowances would continue to fall at the end of any period of normal trade credit because, strictly, that is the date on which the taxpayer is legally obliged to pay.<br><br>
The purpose of clause 53 is, as I explained, to permit capital allowances to be given without regard to any terms of normal trade credit, and in doing so to bring the statute in this respect into line with what we understand is normal accountancy practice for the generality of cases. My hon. Friend said that in his view 99 per cent of the cases would be covered by that. The words chosen to do this may be unusual—the hon. Member for Sedgefield, with his legal background, recognised the work that has gone into them, and I commend the parliamentary draftsmen for the work they have done in devising them—but they are designed to get round the difficulty created by the present statute, which would be continued by the adoption of my hon. Friend's alternative. In the light of that explanation, I hope that he will consider withdrawing the amendment.<br><br>
I come next to Opposition amendment No. 196. It seeks to retain the basic objective of the clause, while not losing the protection against avoidance.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 404</span>
Clause 53 enables the taxpayer to receive capital allowances on expenditure for which a firm and definite debt—the clause uses the word "unconditional"—has been incurred without regard to any period of trade credit which the taxpayer may receive from his supplier, up to a maximum period of three months. Where the credit allowed is longer than that, clause 53 treats the date on which payment is due to be made as the date by reference to which capital allowances have to be calculated.<br><br>
9 p.m.<br><br>
The intention is clear. For example, where a debt for an item of plant is firm, definite and unconditional, our understanding is that normal accountancy practice requires the expenditure to be shown in the business balance sheet at that point as a new asset acquired, even though payment may not be due for a further 30, 60 or even 90 days.<br><br>
In the view of the Inland Revenue, capital allowances are not due under the present statute, whatever the accountancy practice, until the 30, 60 or 90-day point arrives. On the other hand, over the years, accountants have generally followed the practices used to compile the business accounts and they have compiled capital allowance computations for their clients on the basis of the balance sheet figures. In this type of case, we believe that our clause brings the statute into line with practice so long as—the key phrase—the credit period allowed to the purchaser does not exceed three months. I shall return to the practicalities of that provision.<br><br>
We understand that three months should cover the great majority of transactions. We have taken the view that outside that period capital allowances should be given as and when expenditure is due to be paid and not when the debt is incurred.<br><br>
Irrespective of whether there is general agreement that three months is the right period, the amendment of the hon. Member for Sedgefield—I shall deal later with the amendment specifying 12 months—substitutes for what I suggest is at least a precise rule in clause 53(3) a formula which, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, is less clear cut. Because of that, we believe that it would be a difficult rule for businesses, their accountants and for the Inland Revenue to operate in practice.<br><br>
The amendment might allow some businesses to claim capital allowances much earlier than our rule allowed where they could demonstrate that it was their normal trade or commercial practice to receive more than, and possibly much more than, three months' credit from the supplier. That would represent a substantial acceleration of relief where the credit period was long.<br><br>
It may help if I continue my explanation and return to the specific practical suggestions later. If businesses could, by whatever device, prove that three or more months' credit was normal practice, it would represent a substantial acceleration of relief where the credit period was long.<br><br>
It was not part of our aim that businesses should receive capital allowances long before they were actually obliged to lay out their money. That seems quite unreasonable, and I see the hon. Member for Sedgefield nodding in agreement. On the other hand, the hon. Gentleman's amendment would appear to decelerate relief where in any particular case the normal trade
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0747">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 405</span>
credit period was perhaps 30 or 60 days as against the three months allowed in clause 53(3).<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman rightly knew that the definition and controls of the anti-avoidance provisions contained the way to control that aspect of the deceleration under the current precise definition of the rules.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman identified the problem of whether, in the search for precision, three months was right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the Financial Secretary is making two points. First, the problem with using the words "normal commercial usage" is that a company might claim that a particular commercial usage was peculiar to it, which could give it advantages that were difficult to investigate. Why will that problem not arise with the same words as used in subsection (4)(a)? Secondly, is it not the case that, with a fixed three-month period, traders could change their terms from 30 days to three months and thus gain two months' worth of avoidance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to consider the hon. Gentleman's last point. In my view, it is not impossible for the Revenue to prevent that occurrence. The hon. Gentleman's point is important, and I do not wish to answer it without advice. I think that he has touched on the problem of not decelerating.<br><br>
I wish to move to the other side of the measure—extension as opposed to containment. It is covered by amendment No. 135 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering, which suggests an extension of the date. The amendment proposes to extend from three to 12 months the period of any credit which is to be disregarded for capital allowances purposes between the incurring of capital expenditure and the date when that expenditure has to be paid. The amendment would give businesses an entitlement to capital allowances by reference to a date which could fall up to a year before they were obliged actually to lay out the money concerned.<br><br>
However, there is a limit, which I am sure the Committee will recognise, in how far it is reasonable to go in enabling capital allowances to be given to a business before it is required to lay out the expenditure concerned. Our clause recognises—and for capital allowance purposes disregards—credit periods of up to three months. We understand that this should embrace the majority of contracts, especially for machinery and plant. Where a supplier allows credit for a longer period, the purchaser does not of course lose his relief; he will simply receive it by reference to the date on or before which he is required to settle his bill.<br><br>
I should like to cover the point about commercial usage raised by the hon. Member for Sedgefield. He suggested that normal commercial usage was adopted in the anti-avoidance provisions of clause 53(4), and asked why we could not use it in clause 53(3). In fact, there are two triggers that have to be pulled before the anti-avoidance measure comes into play. The date on which a taxpayer claims to have incurred capital expenditure has to be earlier than that which is consistent with normal commercial usage. In addition, the sole or main benefit which he gains as a result has to be that he receives capital allowances in an earlier accounting period.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 406</span>
When those rules apply, the date on which the capital expenditure is to be taken as incurred for capital allowance purposes becomes the date on which it is due to be paid. In the context of an anti-avoidance measure, whose aim is to discourage people from contriving a tax advantage when that is intended by the statute, this seems a reasonable approach.<br><br>
In the context of a general rule, as opposed to the anti-avoidance measure, subsection (3) gives a clear and readily understood requirement which is of great importance if uncertainty in how it operates is to be minimal. The uncertainty engendered by the amendment does not enable us to accept that aspect of it. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will see the difference between the necessary provisions around the anti-avoidance protection, and the general rule.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Sedgefield and for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) and my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering all questioned the three-month provision.<br><br>
Our understanding is that the period of three months proposed in the clause is long enough to cover the normal periods of trade credit allowed in the majority of transactions. However, we would not want to exclude any deserving category of transaction which was not so abnormal as to be an exception. If hon. Members firmly believe that this is so, or can give evidence, I shall look at the matter again and, if I am satisfied that there is a case for some relaxation of the date I shall be fully prepared to bring forward a proposal on Report.<br><br>
I hope that hon. Members will understand the interlocking relationship of the anti-avoidance protection with the attempt to be practical for business. I hope that they will recognise that I expect to see specific and clear illustrations of any problems. My hon. Friend the Member for Kettering thought that 99 per cent of cases were already covered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, as the CBI says in CBI News, if some problems remain to be resolved and they fall into the category that the Minister has just given us, presumably the CBI can write to him directly before Report with evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. As the hon. Member for Sedgefield rightly said, there was a dilemma here. He generously said that he was not sticking to the words of the amendment to try to determine whether the decision that we sought, with the obvious potential pragmatic problems, was the right route, or a less precise way. We felt that it was right, although it was not absolutely certain whether three months was quite right. However, we must have evidence before we can reconsider the matter and, if we have sufficient evidence, I shall return to the matter on Report.<br><br>
Amendment No. 143 is somewhat different as most of the other amendments in the group interlock. It was in the names of my hon. Friends the Members for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, (Mr. Hirst), for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stern), and was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton.<br><br>
The amendment deals with one aspect of clause 53, the treatment of retention moneys. They represent the proportion of a contract price, commonly 10 per cent, which may be held back by a purchaser for a period agreed with his supplier against satisfactory performance of the contract. The retention period could be up
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0748">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 407</span>
to 12 months or even longer depending upon the nature of the contract.<br><br>
Clause 53 gives entitlement to capital allowances when the obligation to pay capital expenditure becomes unconditional. The obligation to pay retention money becomes unconditional when, for example, the agreed period following the commissioning of the asset has passed and the machinery, plant or building concerned has proved to be satisfactory. At that point, the retentions, assuming all other capital allowance conditions are satisfied, are eligible for allowance.<br><br>
The amendment on the other hand would give eligibility for capital allowances on retention money when the principal part of the contract expenditure was incurred, which could be at some substantially earlier date, on the basis that this would follow the way in which retentions are dealt with for accounts purposes.<br><br>
I am advised however that there are two schools of accountancy thought about retentions. I am surprised that there are only two! The first, and possibly the one commonly followed, is indeed to include retentions with the costs of an asset capitalised in business accounts. This would be on the basis that the retentions will probably have to be paid at some time in the future and it would be prudent to take account of them from the beginning. On the other hand the second school of thought would include in the business accounts only the amount of money immediately payable, not the retention, and bring in the retentions as and when they become payable.<br><br>
One effect of the amendment is quite clear however. If accepted, it would give entitlement to capital allowances on this part of the cost of an asset very much earlier than the date on which this part of its cost is payable. Indeed, retention money may never become payable if for any reason the plant or building proves to be unsatisfactory during the agreed retention period. This does not seem to be as reasonable an approach to the matter as that embodied in clause 53.<br><br>
We propose that capital allowances may be given on eligible plant and buildings when the capital expenditure is incurred even if the supplier allows a period of up to three months beyond that for actual payment to be made. For retentions, this means that as soon as the retention money becomes payable, but not before, the taxpayer has an entitlement to an allowance. I do not think that it is possible to get on to the statute book a form of words which can cover satisfactorily every possible case, but here I believe we have found a fair balance and one which avoids the difficulties inherent in the amendment.<br><br>
I apologise for that lengthy response but, as has been said, this is an important area for the outside world. I welcome the fact that the amendments have given us an opportunity to make the issues clear. I hope that in the light of my explanations and my recognition that there may be a need to examine one part of the matter before Report, hon. Members will be content not to press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary has been fair, but I do not find the explanation entirely convincing. We need to be clear whether there is a potential risk of avoidance because of the three-month limit. I hope that he will consider the matter, as he has said. There may not be many examples of credit for longer than three
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 408</span>
months, but there are many examples of credit for less than three months. As the Bill is now framed, there is an incentive for avoidance. We were told that the words "commercial usage" were used in subsection (4), but that that subsection required two preconditions before it came into play, while subsection (3) required only one. In subsection (4) the obligation to pay is artificially put at an earlier date. It is contended that there are perfectly good reasons for the additional condition and that the sole benefit, therefore, is not that of getting the obligation to pay in an earlier chargeable period. It is therefore necessary to have that extra condition in subsection (4) because an injustice might otherwise arise.<br><br>
9.15 p.m.<br><br>
However, when we deal with the case of extended credit in subsection (3), the benefit is obvious: there is no need to state it. The benefit is that the obligation to nay arises at one date and because the extension of the credit is the mechanism of avoidance the benefit is obvious. It delays the requirement to pay although the ability to claim the allowance has already arisen. The Financial Secretary was really saying, perfectly correctly albeit in a way that does not actually meet my point, that the definition of commercial usage will be a problem. I agree with that but that is a problem whether it is in subsection (4) or subsection (3). In any event we are all agreed about the aims of the subsection. We have had a good debate and I am sure that the Financial Secretary will take account of what has been said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary for the positive attitude that he has taken towards my amendment. Representatives of industry, particularly of heavy industry, will thank him for his offer to consider between now and Report the specific problems that could arise under the provisions of the clause. I thank him for that generous undertaking. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 195, in page 49, line 11, at beginning insert
<br><blockquote><p>"save in respect of machinery or plant governed by section 45 of the Finance Act 1971 (machinery or plant on hire-purchase)".</p></blockquote>
The essential feature of the clause is that it introduces a distinction between the obligation to pay and the requirement to pay. The capital allowance is claimed at the time that the obligation to pay arises. The obligation to pay in a hire-purchase sale or in a conditional sale agreement becomes unconditional the moment that the contract is signed. There is therefore, I assume, an obligation to pay at that time. In the normal way one would expect that capital allowances could be claimed from the date when the conditional sale agreement or the hire-purchase agreement was entered into.<br><br>
If that is the case, and once the higher-purchase contract has been entered into capital allowance can immediately be claimed, it ties in with section 45 of the Finance Act 1971. That provides that once a person has been entitled to the benefit of the contract all the capital expenditure to be incurred in respect of that contract can then be the subject of a claim for capital allowance.<br><br>
I find it difficult to see how that is affected by subsection (3) which says that where there is more than a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0749">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 409</span>
three-month credit period it is no longer the obligation to pay which triggers the entitlement to capital allowance but the requirement for payment. The requirement for payment in a hire-purchase agreement will obviously be in serveral stages. But the obligation to pay probably arises on the signing of the agreement. The matter may be dealt with in a manner that I have not foreseen. However, it is intended that hire-purchase sales should still be governed by section 45 of the Finance Act 1971—in which case the capital allowance can be claimed when a person becomes entitled to the benefit of the contract—or is the purpose of subsection (3) to change the law in relation to hire-purchase sales in some way? I am sure that the purpose is not to change the law, but the matter is worth raising because it has caused some concern. It would be useful to have the proper explanation on record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) need not apologise for asking questions on any aspect of this provision. The purpose of his amendment appears to be to ensure that the operation of section 45 of the Finance Act 1971 is not affected by that part of clause 53 which deals with capital expenditure which has to be paid more than three months after the date on which the obligation becomes unconditional.<br><br>
It may assist the Committee if I describe briefly the purposes of section 45 of the Finance Act 1971. It deals with capital allowances on HP contracts and other contracts containing similar provisions. The section serves two important purposes. First, it treats the machinery or plant which is subject to the hire purchase or similar contract as belonging to the person who is buying it under the contract, even though he will not in fact become the owner until the contract ends. That enables him to satisfy one of the main capital allowance rules—that the machinery or plant should belong to the taxpayer—so that the expenditure under the contract qualifies for capital allowances where it otherwise would not.<br><br>
Secondly, from the time when the plant is brought into use for the purposes of his trade, section 45 enables the taxpayer to receive capital allowances on all the future payments due to be made under the contract. In effect, future payments are rolled-up and treated as if they were all paid in one sum instead of when they are in fact due to be paid.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sedgefield, who is obviously probing in this instance, appears to take the view that these arrangements, which obviously benefit the taxpayer, will change if clause 53(3) is enacted in its present form. His amendment explicitly excludes from its scope expenditures on machinery or plant where the rules in section 45 of the Finance Act 1971 apply.<br><br>
I am advised that that is unnecessary. We do not intend clause 53 to affect the way in which section 45 operates and has operated for many years, and we do not think that it will. The present definition of the time when capital expenditure is incurred lives happily side by side with section 45, and we think that clause 53 will do so, too. If I find on further consideration that our intention—which is exactly the same as that of the hon. Member for Sedgefield—is not achieved, I shall, of course, examine the matter again. But we believe that it is achieved, and it is right to get that on the record.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 410</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his remarks. I do not wish to be difficult, but perhaps he will consider a further question. I understand why it is thought that section 45 lives perfectly happily with clause 53, but I have some doubts on the matter. The purpose of section 45 is to deem a time when capital expenditure is actually incurred. Clause 53(3) also states a particular time when capital expenditure is incurred. It refers to circumstances
<br><blockquote><p>"where, under or by virtue of any agreement, the whole or any part of an amount of capital expenditure is required to be paid on . . . a date which is more than three months after the date on which the obligation to pay becomes unconditional".</p></blockquote>
It states that it is the date of the requirement to pay that governs such circumstances. I see nothing in section 45, which defines the time when under a hire-purchase agreement there is an incurring of capital expenditure, that stands as an exception to what clause 53 says. Section 45 states that under a hire-purchase agreement there is a time when capital expenditure is required. But clause 53 goes on to provide that when there is an agreement that the required date of repayment is more than three months after that of the obligation to pay, the required expenditure must be incurred on the date that the payment is required.<br><br>
I find it difficult to understand why section 45 is not subject to clause 53—or, if it is, why the date of the requirement to pay does not govern the time at which capital expenditure is incurred. The Financial Secretary says that the two measures live together; it is, in a sense, precisely for that reason that a residual difficulty arises. Obviously, clearing the matter up to everyone's satisfaction would be better than waiting for a court case. The intent is clear, but, as anyone who has experience of the law and of law courts knows, the intent of the law is not always the same as what is decided in court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to labour the point, but we are receiving the benefit of expensive advice—although we are being given it for free—and I welcome it unreservedly.<br><br>
I am advised that section 45 lays down special rules which operate within the general rule of clause 53. We think that the fears of the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) are misplaced, but we have listened very carefully to what he said. We have exactly the same intent, so we shall certainly consider the measure again to ensure that we are right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek to extend the help that the Government are giving to the shipping industry through clause 55 and schedule 13. The hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) confided in us earlier about his spare-time pursuit—which I thought had rather a minority appeal—of reading through old Finance Bill debates. As his enthusiasm waxed, I was reminded of the wise words of Lord Rosebery, a former Liberal Prime Minister. It is a pity that there is no Liberal party representative present to hear these words.
<br><blockquote><p>"No one reads old speeches any more than old sermons. The industrious historian is compelled to explore them for the purpose of political history, but it is a dreary and reluctant pilgrimage. The more brilliant and telling they were at the time, the more dolorous the quest".</p></blockquote>
I recall a particularly brilliant and telling speech by my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary on 11 July last year when we were debating the Report stage of last year's Finance Bill, to which—in a dolorous quest—I also referred. I mention it because my hon. Friend's remarks last year are relevant to my amendment this year. My hon. Friend acknowledged the importance to this country of the shipping industry, saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"I accept that there are reasons for accepting that the shipping industry is a special case."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say—in words which I warmly applaud—
<br><blockquote><p>"These arguments are not concerned primarily with economic considerations."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend knows that I do not believe in pleading special cases on economic grounds, and I am not trying to do that now. But he went on to give what I believe are compelling reasons for acceding to my amendments.
<br><blockquote><p>"There are … two further strategic considerations. The first relates to our defence needs and to our requirement for merchant ships both for military reinforcement and for naval support … Secondly, we are an island and live by maritime trade. We reject the argument that this industry or that industry is essential. We know that it pays us to concentrate on what we do best, to import what we do less well and to let the international market be the test.— [<i>Official Report,</i> 11 July 1984; Vol 63, c. 1084.]</p></blockquote>
9.30 p.m.<br><br>
He added that the shipping industry posed a greater distinction and observed that one day we may not be able to import other goods and services so as to purchase from abroad those things that we do less well ourselves. I share his views about those two strategic and largely uneconomic reasons for regarding our shipping industry as being different from other industries.<br><br>
It is because of the state to which our merchant marine has declined for world competitive reasons that I have, on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Sir W. Clark), tabled the amendments.<br><br>
Our right honourable Friend the Prime Minister shares our view of the importance of the shipping industry. On 19 March she said that she was aware of a decline in the British merchant fleet because of severe competition from other parts of the world, and that it is of strategic significance to have a good British merchant fleet of considerable size.<br><br>
The situation today is radically different from what my right honourable Friend the Prime Minister would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 412</span>
like. The United Kingdom owned and registered fleet ten years ago stood at 50 million deadweight tonnes. It has now been reduced to 18.5 million deadweight tonnes. We had 1,600 ships ten years ago under the British flag; today, that has been reduced to 676.<br><br>
There has been a severe and long-term decline in the British fleet and that trend seems set to continue. After allowing for second-hand purposes, in 1983 the total additions to the fleet were two million deadweight tonnes. But six million deadweight tonnes were taken out. The annual rate of ordinary new ships has fallen this year to no less than 200,000 deadweight tonnes. The fleet is still contracting, notwithstanding the very welcome help that the Government gave in last year's Finance Act, which will certainly do something to arrest that decline.<br><br>
One of the major problems for the shipping industry is the cost of finance. It is a highly capital intensive industry and probably more than half the total costs involved in shipping is the cost of finance. As a result of the changes introduced last year, it will now take eight years to write a ship down to scrap value. Under the 100 per cent first-year allowances, we could write down the whole cost of the ship in one year.<br><br>
Of course, one of the reasons why the British merchant marine has declined so much over recent years lies in the subsidies that are given by foreign countries to their ships and shipping companies. I do not for a moment seek to wish us to follow that course but it is important to realise the sort of competition that we are up against. One recent example from the timber trade is probably worth quoting. A United Kingdom operator has lost a time charter to a Dutch concern which is building its own ship in the Netherlands at a time when there is vast over capacity in the industry world wide.<br><br>
That time charter was lost because that ship is being built on the back of capital and operating subsidies equivalent to 23.5 per cent of the value of the ship. That sort of activity is continuing in many countries.<br><br>
My amendments seek to ease matters a little further a modest cost to the Revenue in view of the strategic importance of the British merchant fleet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could explain the difference between a capital allowance and a subsidy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the shipping industry, a subsidy is required for non-economic reasons. For the steel or coal industries, for example, a subsidy is not required principally for defence reasons.—[Interruption.] I do not wish to pursue that argument as I hope to be relatively brief, but I see that I have stirred up a hornets' nest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Let me say straight away that I agree 100 per cent with him and hope that there are sufficient Committee Members who will take the amendments seriously and ensure that they are passed. British shipping is vital to the well being of the nation. However, I cannot understand the difference between giving what are basically subsidies—that is not a dirty word—to British shipping and giving subsidies to the coal mining industry, the electricity generating industry, the steel industry or any other industry for cheaper energy costs. Such subsidies are given on the Continent.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 413</span>
There is no difference between giving subsidies to shipping and other industries and if the hon. Gentleman is prepared to say that he will certainly earn my respect. Cases should be taken on their merits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a special case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that it is a special case for the reason that I outlined. If the hon. Gentleman listened to my remarks, I quoted extensively from the speech of my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary last year and also from remarks made by my right honourable Friend the Prime Minister. My hon. Friend and right honourable Friend stated why, for strategic and not economic reasons, the shipping industry was being treated as a special case. I stand by what they said and my earlier remarks, which illustrate clearly why I have tabled the amendments. I do not need to elaborate on them further.<br><br>
Amendment No. 20 proposes to extend free depreciation to second-hand as well as new ships and is intended to preserve for ships the 50 per cent first-year allowance from 1 April 1986 when other plant and machinery expenditure will qualify for writing down allowances only, and to make available writing down allowances for ships in the year when expenditure is incurred.<br><br>
That will enable shipowners to take allowances equivalent to 75 per cent in the accounting period when the expenditure is incurred while the clause gives them flexibility in the use of those allowances. That means that a ship will be effectively written off by 90 per cent after four rather than eight years under the 25 per cent writing down allowance system envisaged for 1986 onwards. That will restore part of the front-loading which is so important to the shipping industry and which was lost by the demise of the 100 per cent first year allowances last year.<br><br>
I pointed out to my hon. Friend a moment ago that it is the front-end loading which is important to the shipping industry, which is very volatile. Significant capital costs are involved.<br><br>
For various reasons which I have given, the United Kingdom stands extremely low in the international league of assistance to ship-owning, and is at present at a considerable competitive disadvantage.<br><br>
I shall not dwell further on the reasons for this amendment, the amendment standing in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Sir W. Clark) and several new clauses on the amendment paper, which I hope will be called later. The amendment is part of a package which I hope will appeal to my hon. Friend for reasons which he himself adduced on another occasion. I commend it to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak on the two amendments because my constituency has a port which is still used for trading and as a fish dock. It used to have a whole fishing fleet. I am very aware of the decline in the British merchant fleet—the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) was right to refer to it—which means that a lot of trade is now handled by foreign flags.<br><br>
When I was in south-east Asia last summer, I visited a shipyard in Taiwan and saw how the Taiwanese are building up their container fleet. Their target is to be top of the world in that respect in the next five or eight years, and they will do it. Although the shipyard and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 414</span>
the industry generally are running at a loss, the Government there intervened and put in massive investment. As a result, Taiwan will have a very large fleet and will flatten competition.<br><br>
It was interesting to see yesterday how the Government have handled the Bosphorus bridge project. The Japanese have cleaned up that type of business because of the way in which the project was financed and put together. We are a bit soft in the head to allow our competitors to run away with things in that way. A precise parallel may be drawn with the British merchant fleet. The damage has largely been done, and it will take a lot to recover the situation, bearing in mind our overseas competitors, such as the Japanese and the Taiwanese in particular, who are extremely powerful in this respect. They have built up such immense strength that I believe that it will be almost impossible for us to recover the situation.<br><br>
I must comment on the way in which the hon. Member for Tatton presented amendments Nos. 19 and 20. It was extraordinary. He suggested that there were strategic and defence reasons, and that, in the Falklands war, ferries and many other vessels from Hull were sent to fight. Frankly, I thought that what he said was phoney. The hon. Gentleman is bound by his idealogy and has to talk in that way, but he knows as well as I do that he was cooking up a story to justify trying to salvage something from the present desperate plight of the British merchant fleet.<br><br>
If we continue with the free market economy approach and do not intervene in the sensible way of the Americans, the Japanese and others we shall see the merchant fleet die. The hon. Gentleman is right. There are now only 600 or so British vessels and the deadweight tonnage has plummeted.<br><br>
9.45 p.m.<br><br>
The case of the write-down was presented entirely accurately. To have to write off a vessel over an eight-year period because of the removal of capital allowance when other countries have vessels financed in such a way that the write-down can be a couple of years is something with which we have to contend. That is the situation throughout the world, and we have to match it.<br><br>
It was funny to hear the hon. Member for Tatton suggest that there should be no subsidy. He was really suggesting that the Government should subsidise the British fleet and British shipowners through this form of tax relief. I support that. The principle that he enunciated was absolutely right, but I do not see why we should put up with the charade and the cosmetic presentation of how it should be done. I would welcome a proposal or an amendment that would provide an opportunity to write down the vessels over a shorter period. One amendment would enable that write-down period to be reduced to four years.<br><br>
I end by asking the Minister a question about how the clause would apply to secondhand vessels. Does it apply to trawlers as well as to trading and merchant vessels? I wish to know because I have an interest in rebuilding the Hull fishing fleet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is delighted to receive from any quarter support for our industrial policy—even from one as surprising as the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton).<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0752">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 415</span>
I thought that the hon. Gentleman illustrated perfectly the inconsistency in the free market theory of the Conservative party. It wants the free market to operate only when it is something that it does not care about. As soon as it cares, it wants the free market shoved aside, and to be given assistance. That shows that we are really talking about caring and about areas in which it is right to invest and areas in which it is not.<br><br>
Despite all the hon. Gentleman's disavowals, I felt that he was making the clearest case of special pleading for a specific industry, and he should not be ashamed of that. If an industry is crucial to this country, of course we should invest in it and build it up.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) made an eloquent case for the merchant shipping industry. It is not only an employment case, but one for trade, because merchant shipping is most important to invisible earnings. We have a Chancellor of the Exchequer who thinks that our service industries will take the place of our manufacturing industries. I thought that I heard the hon. Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar) say that the Chancellor spoke nonsense about service industries replacing manufacturing industries. I have deleted the hon. Gentleman's expletive. But I agree with him. The Chancellor is talking nonsense, and the reason why we should support merchant shipping is that, apart from trading, our share of world invisible receipts is declining, not increasing.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West mentioned the Bosphorus bridge contract. That is very important to the north-east, as the Cleveland bridge company which would have been involved in the making of the Bosphorus bridge is on the borders of my constituency. It is ridiculous that the Japanese are willing to put money into securing such contracts. We do not provide the money and when the Japanese get the contract, we blame them for acting unfairly. People in my constituency ask why we do not support our industry. They ask why, if it is good enough for the Japanese to support, it is not good enough for us to support.<br><br>
When we discuss investment in industry, we should see the matter clearly. This country has a choice. It either lets its manufacturing, shipping and important trading industries decline or it invests in those industries and builds them up. The issue has been raised by the hon. Member for Tatton, who I believed was on the outside Right. He is moving to the Centre Forward. A progressive osmosis must be seeping through the Conservative ranks. We have the choice of supporting or not supporting our industry.<br><br>
I am glad to see that, at long last, Conservative Members are taking seriously support for our industry. I hope that we will be joined by many Conservative Members in voting for the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) created some difficulties for me because he started by quoting the late Lord Roseberry—I gather that he was a Liberal—and therefore failed in his attempt to be beguiling by quoting me. I am not sure that I would embrace that combination. My hon. Friend mentioned cost and it is always relevant to put the cost of amendments to the Committee. The cost of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 416</span>
these amendments in 1987–88 would be £55 million, in 1988–89 £90 million and in 1989–1990 £80 million.<br><br>
The second specific question was asked by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall), who has a strong interest in the whole of the fishing industry, including the docks and trawling. It might be useful for him if I put on record the specific definition of the capital allowances of a ship, which I checked before the debate because I was asked on the Floor of the House whether fishing vessels were included.<br><br>
The capital allowance legislation does not define the word "ship"; nor does it adopt any of the statutory definitions which already exist, such as that in section 742 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, which defines <br><blockquote><p>"ship" as</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"including every description of vessel used in navigation not propelled by oars."</p></blockquote>
In general, the Revenue accepts as a ship for capital allowance purposes anything which is within the definition of section 742 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 or anything which is registered as a ship in the register of British ships, which is generally the same thing. The definition is widely embracing and I know that the hon. Gentleman will be reassured.<br><br>
The amendments would provide a special 50 per cent first-year allowance for capital expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 1986 on the provision of a ship, new or secondhand. They would also permit a writing-down allowance to be taken for the same period, thus providing allowances totalling 62.5 per cent in the year of acquisition instead of the 25 per cent which would otherwise be available.<br><br>
The question of accelerated depreciation for investment in ships was discussed during last year's Finance Bill debates, as my hon. Friend rightly said, at considerable length. The proposal at that time was that allowances for ships should be given at the rate of 25 per cent per annum on a straight-line basis. I pointed out that the effect would be to retain a significant incentive element within the capital allowance system because ships are in general long-life assets with working lives greatly in excess of four years. The amendments meet the points that I made last year concerning straight-line allowances. However, a system which provided allowances at the outset totalling 62.5 per cent and which would allow the cost of a ship to be written-down to about a residual 10 per cent over a period of five years or so also provides a significant incentive.<br><br>
I fully recognise, as have other hon. Members, the importance which the shipping industry attached to the availability of 100 per cent first-year allowances and to the flexibility provided by the system of free depreciation. I shall not take up the Committee's time by explaining again the programme of business tax reforms which we have already discussed and of which this is a part.<br><br>
There are elements in the package of reforms which specifically work in favour of the shipping industry. The ship owners did not normally qualify for stock relief, and so lose nothing from its abolition. Moreover, the company groups with shipping interests gain from the contribution which that makes towards the reductions in corporation tax rates. The fact that under clause 52 the writing-down allowances are being made available at the time when expenditure is incurred, rather than when an asset is brought into use, will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0753">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 417</span>
of help in the case of assets such as ships, where long-lead times are involved and stage payments are normally made in advance of delivery.<br><br>
We do not question in any way the importance to the nation of the merchant fleet, both in balance of payments terms and in general strategic and defensive terms--quite the reverse. I am also conscious of the extent to which other countries assist their shipping industries in various ways. These are all important points which I acknowledged in our discussions last year. It was against that background and in recognition of the importance that the Government attaches to the role of British shipping in all its aspects that we decided to continue the system of free depreciation and to extend it to second-hand ships as provided for in clause 55 and schedule 13.<br><br>
I advise my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West, who, quite rightly, were concerned, as are many of us, about the decline in our shipping industry, that, if one considers the specific capital allowances, under the new closed system our writing-down allowances will be roughly for eight years as compared, for example, with the Japanese, who have 12 years, the West Germans, who have up to 16 years for larger vessels, and the Dutch, who have between 12 and 20 years.<br><br>
One must put into context the decline in the United Kingdom merchant fleet over the past 10 years and see it in perspective. It is not only a question of the recession and too many ships chasing too little business, because the decline pre-dates those changes in capital allowances. Factors which need to be taken into account are the changed patterns of trade, especially in relation to North sea oil, and the development of containerisation. A significant part of the reduction in numbers of ships relates to oil tankers-55 per cent of the tonnage lost over the past decade has been tanker tonnage—while one container ship will do the job previously done by several vessels.<br><br>
I appreciate the way in which my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton sought to argue the case for the industry and for recognising its strategic importance. However, I must advise him that if he does not seek leave to withdraw his amendment, we shall resist it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the debate with interest and had not intended to speak. However, the Minister told us that the concessions would cost £55 million for an industry of strategic importance. I contrast that comment with the announcement made yesterday about Stansted airport, when the Secretary of State for Transport told us that the development of that regional airport would cost £270 million which he said he did not regard as a large investment. If £270 million is not a large investment in one airport in one region, it seems to me that £55 million is a very cheap price to pay for the future of a whole industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the words spoken by my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary about the importance of our merchant fleet, but I also appreciate the difficulties that my hon.

ENTITLEMENT TO ALLOWANCES FOR MACHINERY AND PLANT WHICH ARE FIXTURES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 197, in page 53, line 9, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"save where the provisions of section 85 of the Capital Allowances Act 1968 apply, in which case there shall be an apportionment of allowances between the relevant parties.".</p></blockquote>
In this complicated chapter of this complicated Finance Bill there is no more complicated part than clause 56 and schedule 14. We are delighted to have the Chief Secretary here to answer our questions; I am sure that he will give us the benefit of his wide experience of these matters.<br><br>
The purpose of the clause is important and is generally welcomed by Opposition Members. However, it gives rise to some difficult problems. Yet again, my hon. Friends will be joined by the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton). That hon. Gentleman's affection for the Opposition is becoming alarming to those who pay attention to political purity. His attention to Labour amendments and his hot pursuit of Labour ideals throughout the Bill are a testament to the power of argument. It is plain that in our debates we have been able to convince the hon. Gentleman to alter some of his more misconceived notions.<br><br>
The clause arises from the court case Stokes v Costain Property Investments Limited. I understand that the taxpayer in this case, who was a lessee of property, spent money on landlord's fixtures. The court held that the taxpayer could not claim capital allowances as the premises in question did not belong to him within the meaning of taxation legislation. So even though the tenant had spent money on the landlord's fixtures, because of the strict definition of the words "belong to" within the meaning of taxation legislation, the tenant could not recoup any of the capital allowance outlay. That is unjust and that is why legislation is necessary to redeem it.<br><br>
Although we agree with the general purpose of the clause, difficulties arise in the application of the desire to get rid of the injustice, as set out in clause 56. I pay tribute to the draftsman's ingenuity as he has done his best with a very complicated clause.<br><br>
The essence of clause 56 and schedule 14 is an attempt to deal with the Costain problem by changing the definition of the word "belong". Clause 56 and schedule 14 are deeming provisions extending the definition of "belong" so that the taxpayer can come under it even when he does not have what would normally be called in property law an interest.<br><br>
The evil that the clause aims at is one that it is straightforward to state. The problem arises, and the amendments seek to illustrate it, because the draftsman has sought to extend the definition of when land belongs to someone, but goes further at the end of clause 56(1).<br><br>
At the same time as the extended definition of "belong" is brought into play, so that the tenant in the Costain case would be allowed to claim tax allowance for having spent money on landlord's fixtures, clause 56(1) goes on to say that in those circumstances where
<br><blockquote><p>"any machinery or plant is treated as belonging to any person"—</p></blockquote>
under the schedule—
<br><blockquote><p>"no other person shall be entitled to such an allowance in respect of it."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 420</span>
I am sure that the Chief Secretary will be able to lay our minds at rest about the worry that arises here. The words of clause 56(1) may exclude the situation where the landlord spends money on things that are part of his fixtures, but because the clause deems the land, for capital allowance purposes, to belong to the tenant, and because subsection (1) allows no other person to claim an allowance, the landlord may be unable to claim that portion of the allowance that relates to his expenditure on fixtures. That would be unjust, and undesirable in principle.<br><br>
Section 85 of the Capital Allowances Act 1968 deals with allowances in in respect of contributions to capital expenditure. That allows in esssence for an apportionment when both landlord and tenant are spending money on the landlord's fixtures. It allows for the apportionment of the expenses so that the position of both parties is protected.<br><br>
We are worried that the straightforward, clear words of clause 56 may hit at section 85. The amendment seeks to clarify the relationship between the two. Will the Chief Secretary explain whether the ability to apportion remains, so that justice can be dealt out, between the parties, on an equal basis?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) has summarised, in an admirably succinct way, the underlying purpose of clause 56 and schedule 14. I shall therefore not refer the Committee to the decisions of the House of Lords, and of the judge of first instance, in Stokes v Costain. As the hon. Gentleman has explained, the clause and schedule redress the position in that case, so that in a variety of situations there should be no doubt about to whom the property belongs, and who therefore is in a position to claim capital allowances.<br><br>
The same point underlies amendment No. 197 and amendment No. 204, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton), who, like the hon. Member for Sedgefield, has divined some of the difficulties arising in this complex series of provisions. They seek to deal with the situation that might arise, particularly with the sophistication of modern methods of finance, where various parties have contributed to the cost of an asset.<br><br>
10.30 p.m.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Sedgefield said, the underlying theme—embodied in schedule 14—is that someone should be determined as the person to whom the property belongs and who may therefore be in a position to claim the capital allowance. If two people can be said to have an interest in the property, and they have contributed to the purchase price of the assets, an election can be made between them.<br><br>
However, the position may not be completely covered, and I cannot recommend the Committee to accept either of the amendments, because I am not certain whether they cover the position. However, with the permission of the Committee, I shall take away the problem identified by the hon. Member for Sedgefield and my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton to see if I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0755">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 421</span>
can produce something on Report to meet the case, if that is necessary.<br><br>
There is common ground between the hon. Member for Sedgefield, my hon. friend the Member for Tatton and myself, because we want to ensure that there is a proper ability to claim allowances in the circumstances that have been identified. I am not utterly persuaded that the situation is not covered by the existing legislation, but, if I am wrong, I undertake to introduce an appropriate amendment on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask a question, because I wonder whether there is a loophole. I may have misunderstood the position, but I am sure that the Minister can clarify it.<br><br>
Is it possible for a landlord to assign to a lessee the right to claim a capital allowance which he himself could not acquire because he did not fulfil the terms "wholly and exclusively" for such use, as dealt with in clause 52? Could there be an interrelationship, whereby he might not fulfil the terms himself, but would use his lessee to acquire the right to secure particular adaptations, which a capital allowance supported, to his own property?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. I doubt whether that situation could arise.<br><br>
Under schedule 14, there are one or two situations in which the lessor may be a body or person
<br><blockquote><p>"not within the charge to tax".</p></blockquote>
The clause and the schedule amplifying it are not designed to allow a person to pass on the benefit allowance that he might be disabled from claiming to someone who might be able to do so. Subject to one particular circumstance, which is dealt with in considerable detail in the schedule, where a person may not for a variety of reasons be within the charge to tax, the asset itself in normal circumstances must have been acquired for the purposes of trade. Under the original capital allowances legislation, for example, a landlord may have installed an asset, but, because he is not carrying on a trade, he is none the less enabled to claim an allowance. Here, I speak from memory, because the issue does not arise under the amendments.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that the purpose of the clause and schedule is purely to deal with the point that was identified by the Court of Appeal in Stokes v. Costain, and there is no intention to take the matter further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Chief Secretary for what he has said, and I hope that he will also look at what my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) said. As I understand the words "wholly and exclusively", they relate simply to the fact that the purchase must be wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade at the outset. They do not affect what happens on disposal, where a balancing charge will have to be brought into account. My hon. Friend may have uncovered something, but, in the light of the Chief Secretary's comments, I am content not to press the amendment to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

CAPITAL ALLOWANCES FOR FIXTURES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 198, in page 134, line 8, leave out from "then" to end of line 10 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"the interest in the land shall be treated as held by the person entitled to it, subject to the right of redemption.".</p></blockquote>
The schedule is the horrendously complex part of the capital allowance legislation. It would be extraordinary if, in a schedule of this complexity, there were not matters that one wished to raise in inquiry and not in complaint.<br><br>
The essence of the amendment is to define an "interest in land" in a fairly broad way and affects paragraph 1(3), which I assume deals with an interest in land being subject to a mortgage. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"If an interest in land is conveyed or assigned by way of security and subject to a right of redemption, then, so long as such a right subsists, the interest held by the creditor shall be treated."</p></blockquote>
as the interest held by the debtor. I assume that the provision is designed to ensure that the mortgagee has the interest in land. At least, I hope that that is the purpose.<br><br>
The anxiety arising from that phraseology was brought to my attention by the Law Society brief and there may be a perfectly simple answer to it. There was concern that the word "debtor" might be ambiguous because the debtor might not be the chargee of the land if, for example, there was a guarantee.<br><br>
The amendment is a drafting amendment and it was thought simpler to say that the interest in the land should be treated as being held to the person entitled to it, subject to a right of redemption. Such an amendment would make it clear that the person was a mortagee and get round the difficulties that the Law Society perceived about the use of the word "debtor".<br><br>
There may be a simple answer to the problem. I have no immense affection for the amendment, and not just because I did not originate it. If the Chief Secretary can put our minds at rest, I shall not press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to the hon. Gentleman as best I can.<br><br>
This point is rather arcane. It is possible that the provision to which the amendment is directed could apply to situations arising in England, Wales and Scotland. However, I am advised that it is primarily designed to cover situations arising in Northern Ireland and I candidly admit that I am no expert on Northern Irish real property law. I gather that such transactions are more usual in Northern Ireland than on this side of St. George's channel.<br><br>
Our intention is not to deny a capital allowance that would otherwise be due under schedule 14 to a person who incurs tax expenditure on fixtures and who satisfies the necessary conditions on the holding of an interest in land but where the interest in land has been conveyed or assigned subject to a right of redemption of security on moneys borrowed. That form of transaction is more common in Northern Ireland and the provision is designed to meet such arrangements and to ensure that, even though someone has assigned his interest subject to a right of redemption, he is still entitled to capital allowances.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 423</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I did not quite follow that last point. Is the Chief Secretary saying that subparagraph (3) is designed to deal with circumstances specifically related to Northern Ireland or that the amendment deals with the point that refers to Northern Ireland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that subparagraph (3) could possibly cover circumstances that may arise in England, Scotland and Wales, but that the form of transaction to which it is directed is more common in Northern Ireland. We seek to ensure that the land will be treated none the less as belonging to the person who has incurred the expenditure, although he has assigned it with the right of redemption mainly to raise money. Thus, he will still be able to claim capital allowances.<br><br>
In other words, we seek to ensure that that person is treated as "the owner", having an interest in the land sufficient to enable him—should he have incurred this expenditure—to make a claim for capital allowances. The amendment has aired this point, but adds nothing to secure the claim of such a person to capital allowances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for what the Chief Secretary has said. I hope that, in the light of this debate, his officials will cast their eye over the matter again and see whether their original opinion is correct. With his comments in mind I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following Government amendments: Nos. 177, 173, 174, 175, 178, 179, 180, 181 and 182.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are essentially technical amendments. Slight defects have been identified which need to be cured. I am happy, if need be, to take the Committee through them all one by one, but I think it might be more for the convenience of the Committee if hon. Members raise any problems on which I can put their minds at rest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could we have an explanation of amendment No. 177?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 177 enables the purchaser of an interest in land, to which machinery and plant subject to an equipment lease are attached as a fixture, to receive capital allowances at a capital sum paid in connection with a purchase, and to discharge the obligation under the equipment lease. The particular obligation could be to pay the rental on the equipment lease. If he were to compound that with a capital sum, he would be able to claim a capital allowance for it.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"or is within the charge to tax but is exempt from tax.".</p></blockquote>
Schedule 14(5) deals with expenditure incurred by the incoming lessee and the election to transfer the right to allowances. Therefore, in effect, it provides that where expenditure is incurred by an incoming lessee taking over the property, an election is made, and the fixture is treated as belonging to the lessee in consequence of his having incurred the capital expenditure.<br><br>
However, where such an election can be made, it is necessary to show that the lessor would be entitled in the relevant chargeable period to an allowance in respect of the expenditure incurred on provision of the fixture.<br><br>
The problem arises on paragraph 5(2). It provides that if the lessor is not
<br><blockquote><p>"within the charge to tax"—</p></blockquote>
that is, where the transfer of the right to an allowance occurs—it shall be assumed that he is within it for the purposes of paragraph 5. It could be said that bodies such as pension funds or charities are not necessarily strictly
<br><blockquote><p>"within the charge to tax".</p></blockquote>
Would they be sufficiently protected and enabled to take the election to transfer the right to allowances? Charities could be exempt from tax, but still be within the technical charge to tax. This is a probing amendment to ensure that their position is satisfactorily protected under this complicated paragraph.</span></p>
<p>10.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a rather complex series of provisions. The definition of
<br><blockquote><p>"within the charge to tax"</p></blockquote>
is to be found in section 527 of the Taxes Management Act 1970. The Inland Revenue took the best possible advice when the amendment was tabled to reassure us that in this case a proper transfer under an election could be made, so that the lessee could claim the capital allowance, assuming that he was
<br><blockquote><p>"within the charge to tax".</p></blockquote>
We were advised that under schedule 14 he could.<br><br>
Therefore, I hope that the Committee will accept that the amendment is otiose.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 200, in page 138, line 40, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"This paragraph shall not apply where the severed fixture is deemed to belong after severance to an equipment lessor who is not responsible for the severance and who derives no benefit from such severance.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is concerned with paragraph 7, which deals with cases where a fixture is treated as ceasing to belong to a particular person. In other words, it is a deeming paragraph within the schedule. Subparagraph (7) provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"If … a fixture is permanently severed from the relevant land … and, immediately before that time it was treated for material purposes as belonging to any person ... then, unless on its severance the fixture does in fact belong to that person, it shall be treated as ceasing to belong to him at that time."</p></blockquote>
I take it that that means that if the fixture is taken out so that it ceases to be a fixture, unless it is in the ownership of the person to whom it belonged immediately before it was severed, it is treated as ceasing to belong to him and a balancing charge would have to be made.<br><br>
The difficulty, to which the Law Society drew my attention, concerns an equipment lease, where the insolvency of the equipment lessee may mean that the fixture is severed from the land, possibly by the landlord as distrainment for rent, in circumstances where the equipment lessor has no control and will receive no benefit. Would the equipment lessor be deemed to have received a disposal value? Paragraph 9, which deals with the disposal value of fixtures in certain cases, would then come into play.<br><br>
The amendment proposes that subparagraph (7) would not apply where the severed fixture belonged to an equipment lessor who had no responsibility for the severance and did not derive any benefit from it. In those circumstances, it is not thought right that it should be deemed as ceasing to belong to him at that particular time, and a disposal value arises. It is difficult, within the complexities of that, to see how it works out. I hope that I have made myself clear. It is a narrow point, but it could be quite important. Equipment leasing takes place all the time. If, in the context of insolvency, it meant that a fixture was severed from the land, the Law Society would seem to have a point. It is theoretically possible under subparagraph (7) that the equipment lessor would end up being liable for a disposal value under paragraph 9. If that is the case, it would appear to be unfair for a liability to arise if the equipment lessor had no control over the circumstances of the severance and derived no benefit from it. Perhaps the Chief Secretary to the Treasury can tell me whether I have got that completely wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be very diffident to tell the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) that he has got it wrong. I take his point entirely. At first blush I am disposed to think that theoretically such a situation could arise. However, I am not absolutely certain whether in practical terms that is likely. Nor am I at all certain—and I hope that he will forgive me for putting it this way—whether his amendment is technically watertight and would cure that defect.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 426</span>
With the permission of the Committee I should like to reflect on that and consider whether in real life such a situation could arise. Although I would certainly not question any amendment emanating from the Law Society, I am not sure whether any practical cases have been put to us by the equipment leasing associations or companies of that kind. If, on reflection, we feel that this is a practical problem and there is a risk of hardship—it would be hardship because it would impose a balancing charge on someone who was detached from the situation that had arisen—I certainly undertake to bring something back on Report. I hope that on that basis the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>

DREDGING</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 202, in page 54, line 25, leave out from "expenditure" to end of line 26.<br><br>
We now come to the fascinating subject of dredging, with which I am sure all members of the Committee are familiar. I cannot think of a more appropriate topic to discuss in the context of this Finance Bill.<br><br>
As I understand it, the purpose of the clause is simply to limit the ability to claim initial allowances. The limit is placed so that the initial allowance should only be made in respect of capital expenditure incurred after 1 April 1986—I presume that that is after the transitional provisions of last year's Finance Act have taken full effect—if it consists of the payment of sums under a contract entered into before 13 March 1984 and if those payments are incurred before 1 April 1987.<br><br>
There are two qualifications for claiming the allowance. First, the contract must have been entered into on or before Budget day last year. Secondly, it must cover a time span of not more than three and a bit years—from 13 March 1984 to 1 April 1987.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment, which is a probing amendment, is to delete the second of those conditions. It is sensible to lay down the condition that the contract must have been entered into before Budget day, otherwise people would be entering into contracts simply to take advantage of the changes. However, should we specify that the payments must have been incurred before 1 April 1987? Presumably we are dealing with a genuine contract, entered into before last year's Budget, when no one knew that capital allowances would change. If a bona fide contract provides for payments to be incurred over, say, a four or five-year period rather than a three-year period, is it right to limit it in this way?<br><br>
11 p.m.<br><br>
If clause 58 is essentially an anti-avoidance provision I assume that it is, and if my assumption is wrong much of what I am saying may be based on a falsity—the Government should justify limiting the incurring of payments to 1 April 1987. That limiting period occurs in clause 59 in respect of agricultural land and holdings, and also in clause 63 in respect of hotels. Since the words are of general application, it might be as well to ask now for an explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) is absolutely right. The matter is important because it goes beyond clause 58.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 428</span>
Clause 58 provides for the general abolition of the initial allowance for capital expenditure on dredging. The measure is one of those of which advance notice was given on Budget day, and it is the control mechanisms within it that the hon. Gentleman has rightly asked me to explain—more specifically, the one that extends the transitional contract provisions only until 1987. As he says, that has implications for other parts of the Bill.<br><br>
The background to the incorporation of a cut-off date, which I think is the essence of what the hon. Gentleman is trying to probe, is not only in clause 58 but in the clauses relating to agricultural buildings, scientific research and hotels, as well as in last year's provisions for the phased withdrawal of initial first-year allowances for industrial and other buildings and for plant and machinery. I mention that because the hon. Gentleman was not on the Committee last year.<br><br>
While we thought it right, as a transitional measure, to provide for the continued availability of existing rates of allowance where contracts were entered into before Budget day 1984, we think it necessary to ensure that there is some finality. It would obviously be unfair if, because of the terms on which particular contracts were drawn, they could be kept in being indefinitely and current rates of allowance continued to be available to those who were fortunate enough to have the benefit of such contracts but not to others. The chances of such a situation arising in relation to dredging are perhaps a little remote, but the point raised by the hon. Gentleman goes very much wider than that. That is why cut-off dates appear elsewhere in these clauses relating to capital allowances, which involve reductions in rates or exclusions of certain categories of expenditure.<br><br>
The most significant areas are plant and machinery and industrial buildings. Under a pre-1984 Budget day contract, a cut-off date when expenditure had in general to be incurred—also set at 1 April 1987—was introduced last year in relation to the phased withdrawal of initial allowances for industrial and other types of building and first-year allowances for plant and machinery. We consider it very unlikely that the number of pre-Budget day contracts running beyond 1 April 1987 will be significant, or that any expenditure after that date under those that do run will be significant either. Most long-term contracts require substantial payments along the way, and as the matter has not so far been raised by any outside organisation with pre-1984 contracts, we think that we can assume that the length of the transitional arrangement is adequate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about dredging. Will the Minister explain to me what he understands by the term?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a rather complicated subject, but if the hon. Gentleman wishes I can give the historical background. Most of the elements involved in dredging, in the classic layman's understanding of the term in relation to ports, are carried forward under revenue write-off and not under the normal capital allowances provision. Some elements of dredging are not encompassed within the area capital allowances code. Most of the areas of activity surrounding the ship undertaking dredging activities will obviously be covered elsewhere.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0759">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 429</span>
To ensure that those aspects of dredging that were not specific parts of the statute were included, provisions were introduced to cover the areas defined as dredging. The figures from a survey suggest that over the past few years the total expenditure on that specific part of the capital allowance code, as opposed to activities that are covered in most dock and harbour areas, is somewhere between £3 million and £12 million a year gross. The allowances are, on average, £90,000 a year in terms of the tax write-off. It is a part of the tax code and it has to be brought up to date with the rest.<br><br>
Under the previous system, the write-off period was 22 years and we shall change it to 25 years. That is not a substantive change. I am sure that the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) was not referring to that. The amendment seeks to probe the cut-off point rather than the clause itself which concerns dredging.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who will suffer? Will it be those who dredge or those who own the assets that are being dredged?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am having difficulty in understanding why the hon. Gentleman asked about those who will "suffer". There has been no application from the dredging industry during the year. We are talking about a tiny part of the capital allowances clause. The alteration from 22 years to 25 years is a tiny change to the writing-down allowances. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to refer to the definition of dredging, it is in section 68(10) of the Taxes Act. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman with more specific details on the definition of dredging, if he wishes. It is a minor part of a substantial industry, but all the other capital allowances areas are already taken account of in that industry. We have to clear this matter up within the overall capital allowances changes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that clause 58 was an anti-avoidance clause. I did not mean that. However the clause limits the entitlement to a particular relief.<br><br>
I accept what the Financial Secretary said, but I wish to put two points to him. The Institute of Chartered Accountants referred to the definition of dredging and asked whether the Department could update that definition. I understand that dredging works now includes such things as the placement of soil on a bank to deflect sea currents and the placement of rocks and plastic mats on the sea bed to prevent slippage of walls of undredged and dredged areas.<br><br>
As I understand it, many contracts were entered into on Budget day last year as a direct result of the changes in the general rules. I do not mean in relation to dredging, but generally to all such matters. Has any consideration been given to whether that was the case? Presumably after the Chancellor of the Exchequer sat down in March 1984 there was still time in that day to alter contracts and bring them into being?<br><br>
My information may not be right but it may be worthwhile for the Financial Secretary to tell us whether he knows anything to that effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am asking these questions because I have a harbour in my constituency where major dredging works are going on and we go to the Government regularly to beg moneys to carry out those dredging works. Clearly in the event that the cost of dredging is increased, it will mean that less work will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 430</span>
be done within those harbour areas. The harbour in question is Maryport harbour and I should like to feel that there is nothing in the clause which will reduce the amount of work that can be done per pound spent by the Maryport harbour commissioners, English Industrial Estates or the Allerdale district council. I should like that assurance otherwise I may vote against the clause because I am most concerned about this matter.<br><br>
The fact that these sums of money are small is not particularly relevant, because there are not many projects underway. Perhaps we are talking about a substantial sum of money for individual projects. We are, in fact, talking about reclamation moneys and therefore infrastructural works.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer the specific question asked by the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) relating to contracts on Budget day. Yes, of course that could have happened, but people would have had to move astonishingly fast after the Chancellor of the Exchequer sat down. I cannot remember precisely, but I believe that that was at 5.30 or 6 o'clock in the evening. Of course there is always the possibility that people could have interpreted the full details of the Budget speech before it became the Finance Bill and we know from our studies here about its difficulties and complications. However, the hon. Gentleman is right to say that it could have happened.<br><br>
I apologise to the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) because I do not wish to understate the nature and importance of the dredging industry. The hon. Member for Sedgefield inquired about the Institute of Chartered Accountants asking about the definition. There have been such questions. They often arise when we seek to change the statute, as we are now, because people then re-examine parts of the statute for the first time. Obviously the queries refer to the definition which I referred to in Butterworth. But to the extent that those queries suggest that areas may not be covered by the existing Act, we do not think that there is a problem.<br><br>
However, I am happy to defer to the hon. Members for Sedgefield and for Workington and say that we will look carefully at the definition. Broadly, the definition includes the removal of anything in the widening or dredging of a channel for the first time. Therefore, most of the activities surrounding the other activities of dredging are covered on the maintenance account rather than from the capital account.<br><br>
The areas of claim are small and I shall send a detailed note to the hon. Member for Workington giving him specific annual figures as best I can. But the relevant amounts are still important and he is right to say so. The change, proposed in the capital allowances system has not prompted a single query from anyone involved in the dredging industry during the past year about the change in the time, as opposed to the definition, where, quite rightly, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, as opposed to the industry, has raised a point about the change from 22 years to 25 years. That is the amount of the change.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely, it would not be those who are dredging who would be complaining, but those hiring the services of dredgers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those who would be disadvantaged in the dredging industry would be theoretically disadvantaged if the change were from an initial writing down

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 431</span>
allowance. We are not talking about an industry with an initial allowance of 100 per cent, as some industries have. The change is very minor and theoretically, could affect the industry in a negative way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ah!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The change is from 22 years to 25 years, but it has raised no comment from anyone who will theoretically benefit from it, who are not the dredging contractors themselves but the harbour authorities and the people who have contracts for dredging. The change extends the period over which there can be depreciation, but it is only a minor change and not in any way as significant as the many other changes which were discussed earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am content not to press my amendment, and on the basis of the Financial Secretary's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

Clause 60</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
ALLOWANCES FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE ON SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 203, in page 55, line 15, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"and, for the avoidance of doubt, the word "building" includes fixtures and fittings attached to the land".</p></blockquote>
It may help if I briefly set out the context of clause 60 on capital allowances. It concerns allowances for capital expenditure on scientific research. There are points worth making later on clause stand part about the nature of the Government's attitude towards scientific research. This is a clarifying amendment and is not particularly controversial.<br><br>
In the Budget last year, the Chancellor specifically exempted from his capital allowance provisions capita allowances for expenditure on scientific research, because such research was important. It was deliberately left out to be dealt with this year.<br><br>
In his Budget speech this year, the Chancellor said that with one or two minor amendments, there would be retained capital allowances at the first year allowances of 100 per cent in the old way, before 1984, for scientific research.<br><br>
Clause 60 simply limits that in respect of the acquisition of land and in relation to the expenditure on the provision of a dwelling when it is not used for scientific research. We support that.<br><br>
Our only concern arose over the following matter. In property law, I understand, fixtures and fittings in a building which are deemed to attach to the land become part of that land. The aim should be to allow full capital allowances on a building with its fixtures and fittings if they are specifically used for scientific research. The purpose of clause 60, as I understand it, is simply to exempt the plot of land on which that building stands from the 100 per cent first year allowance entitlement.<br><br>
My concern is that the new subsection on capital allowances and more specifically on scientific research
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 432</span>
disallows any allowance in respect of expenditure on the acquisition of, or of rights in or over, any land. If the fixtures and fittings are rights that appertain to the land, they could be excluded by the new subsection (1A). That anxiety gave rise to the amendment, which reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"and, for the avoidance of doubt, the word "building" includes fixtures attached to the land."</p></blockquote>
That would bring the fixtures and fittings within the purview of the full amount of capital allowances on scientific research and would ensure that the allowance is required. The purpose of clause 60 is not to include fixtures and fittings attached to the land. The amendment is therefore simply an attempt to clarify and make absolutely sure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is expressed so as to seek to avoid doubt, as the hon. Member rightly said. He made clear that the intention is to ensure that, in appropriate circumstances, expenditure properly attributable to assets that are attached to land will continue to qualify for scientific research assistance.<br><br>
I am advised that the clause as it stands should not in practice prevent scientific research allowances being given for such machinery and plant. It is not our purpose to go any further than the exclusion of costs properly attributable to land and, in appropriate circumstances, the provision of residential accommodation. However, in view of the hon. Gentleman's amendment and his comments, I shall consider the matter again and if necessary—if I am not certain—bring forward an amendment on Report to ensure that his point is covered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a generous offer and I am content to accept it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause relates to capital allowances for scientific research. I wish to raise the topic of cervical cytology, which is practical scientific research and essential to saving life.<br><br>
I tried to table an amendment to enable me to raise the issue and to try to secure some practical advance on capital allowances for GPs so that computerisation could go ahead. I tried to get capital allowances for GPs, health authorities and family practitioner committees so that they could push ahead with the computerisation programme for a localised call and recall system, which could save more than 4,000 women's lives. I sought to implement the 1981 report of the experts on the committee on gynaecological cytology, who said that they could set up a computer-based local call and recall scheme everywhere in the country on strict national guidelines. That was rejected by the Government.<br><br>
I tried to table an amendment that was directed to capital allowances for GPs or health authorities. I consulted the Library and was told that there were difficulties. I was given several reasons, the first of which was that the Finance Bill raises money but does not provide for expenditure. I take that point, but I must say that we have a crazy system which is greatly out of date if we cannot properly raise such important and relevant issues.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0761">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 433</span>
The second difficulty mentioned by the Library was that the main agencies involved are the local health authorities and that, by and large, they do not pay tax. I was told also that GPs who do pay tax would in the normal course of business be eligible to claim capital allowances if they bought plant and machinery wholly for their professional use. That is clearly inadequate because in reality it applies only to some GPs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not wish to minimise the importance of what the hon. Member has to say, but it appears to me that he is establishing a complaint about not being able to table an amendment. I am rather puzzled about the hon. Gentlemen's line of argument so far on clause stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure you, Mr. Leadbitter, that that is not the case. I was explaining why I did not table an amendment. The issue is relevant to clause stand part because it is about capital allowances for scientific research, which is the title of clause 60. Capital allowances for GPs to do practical scientific research, such as cervical cytology, would be a way to advance the service. It is relevant to the clause stand part debate.<br><br>
I hope, Mr. Leadbitter, that you will allow me to explain why I did not table an amendment. That is relevant because I shall outline some of the difficulties that we face in trying to improve cervical cytology, which is vital.<br><br>
Some GPs get capital allowances, but that is not sufficient encouragement to all of them to become computerised. The capital allowances are in any case minimal, and that is not appropriate. They must be increased so that there is encouragement for 100 per cent computerisation. The financial arrangements could be a problem because a distinction has to be drawn between the costs incurred by the GP and those paid for by the DHSS. Some GPs get money from the DHSS for the computerisation. However, there could be administrative difficulties, and that stands in the way of a sensible and effective amendment. The DHSS wants computerisation at family practioner level rather than at GP level, otherwise, it says, there may be duplication. That could be disputed. I believe computerisation of call and recall systems operating at GP level to be the most effective. There is very little computerisation at the moment, and that is inadequate.<br><br>
The librarian's final point was that the most favourable amendment to the Finance Bill could not improve the terms of encouragement given to GPs that existed before the Finance Act 1984. He said that if the pre-1984 rules were inadequate—they must have been because the problem existed then—it is difficult to imagine why similar conditions could be more successful in the future. That precluded my tabling an amendment to return to the 1984 conditions. That would not have been an improvement. There would be a formidable list of difficulties in the way of my proposed amendment.<br><br>
It is appropriate that the general issue is raised in the clause stand part debate. Three key points should be made. First, the need is so much greater. Lives are at stake. Women who could be saved if we had an improved system are dying. The trend is getting worse. Compared with other countries, our record is bad. The second key point is that of Treasury responsibility. It
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 434</span>
cannot be allowed to hide behind the DHSS as it has done when that Department has taken the decision not to provide money or to give capital allowances.<br><br>
The third point that is directly relevant to the clause is that capital allowances may be a way forward in getting a computerised recall system, although I believe that a direct grant to GPs or the family practitioners committees or the DHAs is probably a better way. The Treasury should be condemned for its meanness in not putting up money for that approach, which would be far more effective.<br><br>
11.30 p.m.<br><br>
I said that I would deal with the question of need and I shall cite an example of a local need. My local free newspaper, the Yellow Advertiser, in its issue of the week ending 29 March 1985, carried a headline of "Cancer deaths battle" over a story which stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Twenty women died of cervical cancer in Waltham Forest last year—lives that could have been saved".</p></blockquote>
That is the point. It continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"Campaigners say that not enough time or money is spent on regular checks for cervical and breast cancer—checks that could save lives."</p></blockquote>
The article refers to a woman who died in Oxford because the system was inadequate and says that there is a campaign fighting to get smear tests every three years instead of at the present five-year intervals, which is the inadequate system provided under the Government.<br><br>
The article made a point that is relevant to my constituency because laboratory tests are carried out at Whipps Cross hospital, which was closed down for three months last year. That was a scandal.<br><br>
The issue is of national importance. I know that the hour is late and I shall try to keep my remarks as brief as possible, but this is a vitally important topic. I repeat that the Treasury is answerable for the present inadequacies of the system as well as the DHSS.<br><br>
I draw the Committee's attention to an article which appeared in The Guardian on 30 April 1985. It summarised the national position quite clearly. It stated that the Minister for Health said
<br><blockquote><p>"that the Government would not provide the basic equipment to set up £16 million worth of computers … The shadow health minister, Mr. Frank Dobson, said that … it was important to both call and recall women for smear tests."</p></blockquote>
He was reported as saying that the Government were not providing extra money, staff or laboratory facilities and were complacent. The article quoted a British Medical Association spokeswoman as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"They are not concentrating on younger women"</p></blockquote>
and said that the Imperial Cancer Research Fund had calculated
<br><blockquote><p>"that a computer system for calling and recalling women for smears every five years"— </p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Chair must apologise to the hon. Member because I have difficulty in hearing, a matter which is my problem. I have tried hard to follow the hon. Member and, while he is sincerely engrossed in the issues that he has in mind—I respect that—nevertheless, he appears—I put it no higher than that at this stage—to be going much wider than clause 60. I hope that he will try to bear in mind that clause
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0762">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 435</span>
60 is quite specific in its details. If he would try to confine himself to the clause it would be helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not seeking to go wider, Mr. Lead-bitter. I am sticking to the key point of capital allowances for scientific research, and cervical cytology is practical scientific research. Capital allowances for GPs may well be a way of advancing the service and the Committee should consider that. However, I take your point about keeping my remarks brief.<br><br>
The amount of £17 million could have been used to set up a proper computerised system for GPs which could have dealt with investigations into breast and cervical cancer as well as updating all the records of the FPCs and GPS. But the Government put a block on that £17 million, which is a relatively small amount.<br><br>
The Treasury hides its responsibility in this respect behind the DHSS. I want to know what part it played in the Health Minister's announcement in April that he would not put up that money. Were Treasury Ministers consulted first? They should explain why they are so mean when women's lives are involved. Capital allowances for scientific research could provide a way forward if they were given to all GPs. That would encourage computerisation, which could save more than 4,000 lives. I have a brief which says that clause 60
<br><blockquote><p>"concerns scientific research. We could raise general points here about investment in R & D and the poor record of Britain compared with our competitors."</p></blockquote>
Indeed, the Government's record on cervical cytology is abysmal. The Treasury Ministers should answer for that policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Fatchett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) on raising this important issue.<br><br>
However, I wish to move away from the details of the application of scientific research to the more general implications of the clause. I want to ask the Financial Secretary about the amount of money that we are discussing in relation to clause 60, which could be crucial in terms of developing scientific research. I suspect that the clause does not represent a strategy in that respect on the Government's part, but that it is merely a recognition by them that there are severe problems in the scientific community because of gross under-funding.<br><br>
I remind the Committee that 60 per cent of scientific research is funded from the public sector. Perhaps the Government will examine that imbalance and encourage the private sector to take on a bigger responsibility. However, the private sector is not usually prepared to invest in scientific research until it has an applied purpose. The problem is that much work which may have an application at some future time does not immediately attract private funds as it is pure rather than applied research.<br><br>
If the Government are to encourage that role for the private sector, it may be in the interests of science for it to act much earlier rather than at the point of application. Furthermore, it should be realised that the backcloth to scientific research is acutely depressing. The 1982 OECD figures show that for civilian research and development, Britain is tenth in the league. Indeed, our position continues to decline. A major reason for that is the extensive pull of R and D and other defence
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 436</span>
expenditure that takes resources for research with a civilian application. The available evidence shows that defence research does not necessarily—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I suggest to the hon. Member that it could be an abuse of the Committee to produce a comparative analysis of allowances involving other Departments and other countries. We could go on for ever, if we were ingenious enough to produce the argument in that way and the Chair was lax enough to accept it.<br><br>
Clause 60 is definite about its definitions, and we should confine ourselves to the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to labour the point but, with respect, Mr. Leadbitter, I disagree with you. I was trying to make the point that we hope that the clause will make more funds available for scientific research. My argument was that that is not the same as developing a strategy for scientific research. My criticism of the Government is that they do not have that strategy.<br><br>
Part of the strategy is to recognise the imbalance in this country between civilian and defence research and development. If we compare it with that in other countries that have developed a strategy and have probably not come in at this stage to put a finger in the dam, we see a different level of expenditure on defence research and development in this country as against others and a converse level of expenditure on civilian research.<br><br>
I want to quote some figures, as they are relevant to the clause. The 1982 figures for the United Kingdom, which are the most recently available, show that, of the total research and development expenditure, 7 per cent goes on industrial productivity and technology, but in Western Germany the figure is 12 per cent. In France, it is 12.5 per cent. So comparison across countries shows that the expenditure on industrial activity is much more limited in this country than it is in others.<br><br>
I ask for restraint on your part, Mr. Leadbitter, because I also want to point out that if we make defence comparisons the figure is 52 per cent in this country compared with 8.9 per cent in Western Germany. If the Government are talking about a strategy for scientific research, it is necessary to look not only at money but also at the balance between the different areas of scientific research and to make sure that more of that is applied research that goes into industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that ten major defence research establishments are in the south of England, within 50 miles of London? That is one reason for the development of high technology companies in the south east, in the London area and in the home counties. One of the grievances of the regions—certainly in the north and around Leeds, the Lake district, Scotland, Manchester and Cheshire—is that they do not have those defence research establishments and cannot attract the high technology companies that rely on tendering for orders from local defence research establishments. That is an impediment to our industrial development.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Fatchett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree to a great extent with what my hon. Friend has said, but I remind him of one crucial point: the commercial and industrial spin-off from defence research and development has not been high. My hon. Friend may be right in saying that one spin-off is in jobs related to the defence industry and to research
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0763">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 437</span>
and development on defence, but there is not necessarily a spin-off from that into industrial and commercial application of the scientific knowledge that we develop. I should like a strategy that has a greater ability to use our scientific knowledge for industrial and commercial purposes, because this country is different from others in so far as our greater scientific knowledge is used much less extensively in industry than in other countries.<br><br>
11.45 p.m.<br><br>
Perhaps you will allow me to develop the argument further, Mr. Leadbitter. There is a need for a strategy. Perhaps the clause will make new money available to scientific research, but if it is to do that, we need substantial sums from the clause to redress the balance of cuts that have taken place elsewhere.<br><br>
11.45 p.m.<br><br>
It is worth reminding ourselves that the chairman of the Advisory Board for the Research Councils estimates that the councils face a cut of 25 per cent over the next ten years under present Government policies. That represents a severe cutback in scientific research, which I can tell the Financial Secretary will not be redressed by the clause. If we are to have a coherent and cohesive policy in scientific research, we must make use of public funding.<br><br>
To complete this depressing backcloth to scientific research, we must again remind ourselves that over the past three years the research councils have rejected 600 alpha-rated projects each year. Thus nearly 2,000 alpha-rated projects—which other scientists have decided have intrinsic scientific merit and may be of value to the community in the sense suggested by my hon. Friend, and also of value to industry and commerce have been rejected. Their rejection has been due not to a lack of scientific ability but because the funding is not available to the research councils.<br><br>
Finally, I must draw the Committee's attention to the need for a strategy for science. A sad feature of Government's policy is that they have no such strategy, and those employed in the scientific industries, the scientists who look to Government for such a strategy, have over the past three years been grossly disappointed. Without a reversal of the policy, the scientific community will find itself more and more depressed. Whatever money the clause may provide will not be sufficient to redress the damage that the Government have already caused to science.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Pike <span class='memberconstituency'>(Burnley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to speak in the debate, but there are arguments to be advanced. My hon Friends the Members for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) and for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) have already raised some important points that should be noted by the Government.<br><br>
In this clause stand part debate we should be considering one aspect of the Government's policy that could ensure that we are able to compete with our competitors in other parts of the world. We recognise the importance of research and development, and of scientific research, to the future of our industry. We must invest in them now if we are to secure world markets in the next few years.<br><br>
If we are not competing on equal terms, it is up to the Government to do something about it. I recognise
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 438</span>
that there are many other ways in which the Government can assist research and development, but it is necessary to ask the Government if they are keeping pace with other countries on capital allowances. If the Government cannot give us satisfactory assurances now, we hope that they will think again and return on Report, with a helpful new clause. As an Opposition, we are not in a position to do that, but the Government are and I hope that they will take the opportunity to do so.<br><br>
Having worked in industry, I have seen the importance of research and development in which a great deal of money is involved. We must consider particularly the multinationals, which can decide where to spend their money on research and development. They can compare what we have on offer to what is available in other countries. We must encourage all industry to spend money on research and development, but multi-based companies enjoy greater flexibility and choice. I am thinking of the Philips group, for which I worked for ten years. A multinational group can go to the country whose Government give the best capital allowances and who are prepared to assist in other ways with research and development. If we do not compete on equal terms, we shall not get that important work done in this country, and unless that happens we shall not be able to persuade industry to use the results that it will bring. Obviously, the country that carries out the research and development has a head start in the manufacture of the product. Certainly some products have been made abroad after having been developed here, but at least there is a better chance of their production in this country if the research is done here.<br><br>
We do not want Britain to become merely an assembler. We want Britain to be at the forefront of research and development, manufacturing goods that can compete in the world's markets and transforming the present deficit on manufactured goods into a surplus.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will tell us that we are at least as good as those with whom we are competing. If not, do the Government intend to have further thoughts? We should be in a position at all times to compete with other countries on an equal basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is right for us to have a stand part debate on this clause because of the importance of scientific research and because of the way in which the clause illustrates the Government's attitude and the illogicality of much of their thinking on capital allowances and capital investment.<br><br>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this clause had to be in the Bill, and that capital allowances had to be retained for scientific research, because of the importance of scientific research. If it is important to keep capital allowances for investment in scientific research, why do the Government not accept that capital allowances lead to greater investment? Otherwise there is no purpose in having a clause to provide for capital allowances for investment in scientific research.<br><br>
If capital allowances for scientific research increase investment, why do not capital allowances for other types of investment increase production? There is an illogicality in separating scientific research unless we are saying that it is so important that it takes precedence over anything else.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0764">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 439</span>
Scientific research may be very important, but there are other important areas, too. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) said that if it is important to have scientific research as a priority, surely it is important to broaden the concept to include other important matters.<br><br>
Part of the problem with our scientific research programme and with research and development as a whole is that the private sector is not providing satisfactory forums. What do we mean when we talk about capital allowances? This issue arose in the debate that was initiated earlier by the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton). We are talking about a form of subsidy, a form of public assistance. If that public assistance works indirectly through capital allowances, why should it not work directly through public investment? That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) raised the question of a strategy for science and scientific research. If we take industry and society seriously, we should be prepared to donate enough funds in the public sector as well as in the private sector to provide the base for meeting our needs, both industrial and social. Is it not strange that we give capital allowances for scientific research at the very time when we are cutting back on education?<br><br>
The question was also asked, "What exactly is the cost of retaining the capital allowance for scientific research?" I wish to press the Financial Secretary on the costings for the clause. The Government are shy about costings. They have been extremely coy about costings for the recent social security reviews. We have had a shortage of costings, so we are right to press the Government on this issue.<br><br>
Can the Financial Secretary say specifically whether the clauses on capital allowances are fiscally neutral? Will they ensure that the revenue is neutral in terms of the effective level of demand? It is important that we know whether there is fiscal neutrality so that there is not an effective depression of demand in this and other areas.<br><br>
We welcome the escape of scientific research from the error of the 1984 Budget, but why is the measure important for scientific research but not for rest of industry? Moreover, if the Government accept the need for subsidies to scientific research, why do they not wholeheartedly take on board their role as a Government acting on behalf of the community and construct a proper scientific research programme and a proper strategy for industry involving both the public and the private sectors?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an extensive debate and the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) has brought us back to the clause. I do not complain about the ingenious way in which the hon. Members for Leyton (Mr. Cohen), for Burnley (Mr. Pike) and for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) sought to draw from me a response on overall Government policy on economic and scientific research and on almost every other aspect of Government strategy.<br><br>
I cannot answer all the hon. Gentleman's queries, which, in their terms, are legitimate, on aspects of scientific expenditure. However, as the hon. Member for Sedgefield said, this clause in the capital allowances section of the Bill meets their desires to the tune of 100 per cent. I shall deal later with the hon. Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 440</span>
Leyton's query on definition. The hon. Gentleman's desires are not met in other areas where you, Mr. Leadbitter, would not want me to stray. I am sure that the hon. Member for Sedgefield expressed the Opposition's view when he welcomed clause but he asked why it did not apply to other matters. The decision embodied in the clause is exceptionally to continue the allowances for scientific research at a level of 100 per cent. It reflects what we perceive to be the special high risks involved and the crucial nature of scientific research.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sedgefield asked me why we kept 100 per cent for scientific research and not for other types of research. We could have a longer debate, as we did on clause 52, about the nature of capital allowances. Most people understand that scientific research is generally indirect, riskier and not of the same nature as plant or buildings. Frequently research does not produce results. There is not much material for debate. Those who argued elegantly though not necessarily specifically on the clause recognised the special nature of scientific research.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Leeds, Central and for Sedgefield asked about cost. The hon. Member for Sedgefield will understand the difficulty. The Government are not trying to avoid answering questions on costs. Although we have had 100 per cent initial allowances in every other area, industry and the outside world have not focused on claiming a particular allowance.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sedgefield is right to draw costs to the Committee's attention. Presumably I shall come back to the Committee—perhaps in another Session—to change and update data. However, it has not been possible to be as focused as one would wish, because of the nature of 100 per cent first-year allowances. There is a scarcity of hard data on the nature and levels of different types of expenditure on scientific research. In 1981, the scientific research allowance claimed on oil was about £20 million net of grant expenditure—another problem in this area is the quantity of the grant—estimated at £200 million.<br><br>
12 midnight<br><br>
In the period to 31 March 1984, allowances were almost certainly claimed under other all capital allowance heads, especially plant and machinery where the rate was also 100 per cent. With the gradual disappearance, with effect from March 1984, of first-year allowances for plant and machinery and initial allowances for industrial building, there is likely to be an increase in the level of claims for scientific research allowance, possibly already under way. The tenor of the Opposition's argument is, "Right, but why not with everything else as well?" I understand that.<br><br>
I have great respect for the work that I know the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) does in the scientific field he talked about. However, although I recognise his strong interest, I am not sure whether all his remarks should be addressed to me at this time. I admire the ingenuity with which he managed to get his views across. I understand the difficulty in trying to define the scope of the allowances in these areas.<br><br>
The allowances were intended to cover all forms of scientific research expenditure incurred in connection with a business activity. They include certain types of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0765">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 441</span>
medical research and agricultural research, as well as ordinary scientific research in industry. They covered capital expenditure such as expenditure on laboratory buildings, plant and machinery and—oddly, for a capital allowance—revenue expenditure, such as salaries and wages of staff in a laboratory. In addition, allowances were given to businesses for payments they made to scientific research carried out by a university or college, provided that the scientific research in question—I think that this was the problem the hon. Gentleman had in discussion with the Library—was connected with their own trade.<br><br>
Scientific research has been given a wide definition.
<br><blockquote><p>"Any activities in the fields of natural or applied science for the extension of knowledge"</p></blockquote>
qualify. The final decision on whether particular activities constitute scientific research originally lay with the appropriate research council or committee of the Privy Council. In 1965, however, this function was taken over by the Secretary of State or the Minister of Technology, as appropriate. Nowadays it is the function of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.<br><br>
Expenditure on scientific research on medical research related to a trade qualifies, and there will be the 25 per cent WDAs on machinery and plant used by general practitioners. If the hon. Gentleman will write to me explaining some of the difficulties in relation to the definition, I shall be happy to consider those points, as I recognise his interest and the interest we all share in that area.</span></p>
