BLENDING OF CERTAIN WINES TO CONSTITUTE PRODUCTION OF WINE</div> <!-- title -->
<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Question proposed</i>, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Hodge Hill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to oppose the clause—[<i>Interruption.</i>] Before I hear too many comments about being out of ratio, may I say that I shall be joined shortly by my hon. Friends who all have a passionate interest in public order. They were fully confident that I would be able to tackle these odds alone.<br><br>
This clause is known to my hon. Friends as the Joan Collins clause. It arises from a court case that involved the commissioners of Customs and Excise and the firm of Cinzano (UK) Ltd, whose product was advertised so effectively in a series of TV commercials featuring Joan Collins and the late Leonard Rossiter. It concerns vermouth. It is not only Cinzano, because other importers of vermouth, such as Martim, are affected by the clause. Indeed, it concerns all fortified wines, the others being sherry and port, in that those fortified wines are also blended to some extent in this country. All the drinks are imported, but not necessarily as finished products; sometimes they are imported and then blended to make the vermouth or sherry that is sold to consumers.<br><br>
A year ago, the Government changed the arrangements for the excise duty on fortified wines as part of the package that was introduced as a result of interference by the Common Market. There are four rates of excise duty, depending on the strength of the imported wine. People working for Cinzano noticed that if they imported vermouths of different strengths, paid duty according to the strengths of those imported wines, and then blended the imported wines in appropriate proportions, the finished product would be identical to the vermouth that they were then importing for sale in this country. Moreover, the duty paid on the blended vermouth—that is, the duty paid on different strengths—would be less than the duty paid on the same vermouth if it were imported as such. In other words, the blended vermouth would be the same, whereas the blended duty would be lower.<br><br>
There was nothing illegal in that idea. The people working for Cinzano spotted a loophole in legislation that was introduced by the Government a year ago. They were perfectly entitled, as I am sure the Treasury
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
will admit, to use that loophole to reduce the tax they had to pay as excise duty.<br><br>
The development was a godsend to Cinzano (UK) Ltd. I should explain that Cinzano has had a bottling plant for several years at Telford in Shropshire—a new town. The plant was opened in 1977, at a time when the demand for vermouth was increasing rapidly in this country. That has changed, and the demand for vermouth is now declining. I understand that the total market for vermouth has fallen by 20 per cent in the past five years, and that is a dramatic fall in anyone's market.<br><br>
The trade attributes the decline in the sales of vermouth to the increases in the amount of excise duty imposed on fortified wines by this Government during the past five years. The increases in tax on vermouth and other fortified wines has been greater than the rate of inflation. Indeed, the increases have been far greater than the increase in tax on wines. That is important, because it is believed that the switch in consumer preference has been from the fortified wines of vermouth and sherry to lighter wines, which are imported as table wine. Consumption of table wine in the United Kingdom has grown at the expense of fortified wines of all kinds.<br><br>
Over the five years of this Government the increase in excise duty on fortified wines has been no less than 79 per cent, compared to an increase of only 21 per cent on table wine. Prices of table wine cover a broad span, but among products of roughly the same price, there has, not surprisingly, been a switch from fortified to table wine.<br><br>
For companies specialising in fortified wine, such as Cinzano and Martini, which have other products but specialise in vermouth, and companies with much business in the sherry trade, the picture has been bleak. The Cinzano company has experienced a real decline in its market, and that has put the Telford bottling plant into real difficulties. I gather that a year ago the management of Cinzano was very worried about the future of that plant, sited in a new town and employing about 25 temporary workers and 50 full-time permanent employees.<br><br>
Serious discussions took place about the possibility of closing the plant, but changes in excise duty last year saved it and the jobs in it by encouraging the blending, instead of only the bottling, of vermouth. The Government do not deserve too many thanks; last year's loop-hole was not deliberate. I do not believe that it was in the minds of Treasury Ministers on last year's Standing Committee that an arithmetical quirk in excise duties would save 50 permanent jobs in Telford. Neverthless, that was the effect; it was a happy accident for Cinzano employees.<br><br>
By importing vermouths of different strengths and blending them at Telford, the company reduced the excise duty that it had to pay by £3 million. That would, of course, make a significant contribution towards the cost of the plant, and the switch was made from bottling to blending and bottling.<br><br>
The response of the Commissioners of Customs and Excise was not a happy one; they immediately tried to persuade Cinzano to pay extra tax. No one suggested that the company had done anything illegal, but the commissioners tried to persuade Cinzano that the act of blending was an act of production and that it should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0571">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
pay extra tax; Cinzano, naturally, resisted. The case went to court. At the first hearing, in the High court, the Commissioners won their case. The management of Cinzano was not so easily put off, and went to the Court of Appeal which found for the firm, against the Commissioners of Customs and Excise. Recognising their obligation to maximise revenue for the Government, the Commissoners took Cinzano to the House of Lords where the decision was unanimous and the judges concurred that Cinzano was right, and that the act of blending was not an act of production.<br><br>
In effect, the Government have not accepted the decision, and that is the purpose of clause 5. They intend to use their majority in the House of Commons to reverse the decision of the House of Lords, the highest court of appeal, so clause 5 defines blending as production.<br><br>
Clause 5 will double the taxation on vermouth blended in this country, although it will not affect vermouth imported and sold in the shops. Clause 5 introduces double taxation. I should have had some sympathy if the Government had come to the Committee and said, "Congratulations to the managers of Cinzano. They are sharp-eyed fellows and clever chaps. They got away with it for a year, but we do not think that they should continue to get away with it and have the advantage of this loophole any longer. Therefore, we shall ensure that they pay just as much tax by importing and blending as they would have paid if they had imported the finished product." I would have understood and been less critical if that had been their aim.<br><br>
However, the Government are not telling Cinzano and the other importers that they will make sure that they do not make a profit, or a contribution to the cost of blending by importing wines of different strengths and then blending them here. They are not saying that they want the amount of tax that they would get if the wine were already blended when imported, or that they want their tax, regardless of where the blending takes place. They want more tax if vermouth is blended in this country than if it is blended in Italy and then brought to this country.<br><br>
That is nonsense. It is double taxation. The Government want to charge excise duty on vermouth of different strengths which has different rates of duty when those wines are imported. Then, when Cinzano has blended and bottled the wine and sent if for sale, the Government will tax it again at the full rate of the excise duty on the new strength. Heads the Government win, tails they win twice. They think that they will make extra money if Cinzano, Martini and the other importers blend in this country.<br><br>
That will inevitably mean a loss of jobs at Telford as it will make the plant uneconomic according to the managers. It was a bottling plant but it is now a blending and bottling plant. The firm has already given redundancy notices to the temporary or part-time employees, and has already had discussions with full-time employees to explain the effects of the clause. Of course other importers of vermouth such as Martini, will also be affected.<br><br>
Importers and sellers of other fortified wines will also be affected by the clause. The larger part of the fortified wine market is in sherry—more sherry is sold than
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
vermouth—and small amounts of port are also involved. Sherry is also blended in this country if it comes from some other countries. Some sherry is imported and sold in the same condition in which it left its country of origin.<br><br>
However, I am told that Cyprus sherry in particular is usually blended in this country before it is sold. A large share of the Cyprus sherry market is held by the Co-operative movement; indeed, I believe that the Cooperative wholesale society accounts for some 27 per cent of all sales of Cyprus sherry in this country through its outlets.<br><br>
The Co-operative wholesale society has imported sherry from Cyprus and blended it in this country for as long as anyone can remember. The society goes back a long way, and memories go back a long way, but I cannot find anyone who can tell me when it began to import and blend sherry here. It is blended at Irlam, near Manchester, and 150 people are employed at the plant. I do not want to exaggerate. Those people are engaged in blending other drinks and in bottling, so I am not suggesting that the jobs of 150 people are dedicated to blending Cyprus sherry. However, it has an effect. A large part of the company's business is blending and bottling Cyprus sherry. To remove that part of the business would put some of those 150 jobs at risk.<br><br>
The Bill insists that the Co-operative Wholesale Society or its agent shall pay excise duty at the time of importing Cyprus sherry at the appropriate rates for their strengths and also on the finished product at its appropriate strength. That double taxation will increase the prices of Cyprus sherry in this country by significant amounts.<br><br>
The most popular type of Cyprus sherry sold by the Co-operative Wholesale Society is a cream sherry. The increase this year in what I shall call the duty bands—the increase mentioned by the Chancellor and described in the press release from the Customs and Excise—is 10p a bottle. The increase in duty in what I shall call the blending tax is an extra 20p a bottle on Cyprus cream sherry and 30p on dry sherry. The total increase from tax changes would be 30p on cream sherry and 40p on dry sherry.<br><br>
Those are significant increase. We are talking about a retail price of £2.19 for a bottle of the Cyprus cream sherry supplied by the Co-operative Wholesale Society. A total increase of 30p puts up the price to £2.49.<br><br>
4.45 p.m.<br><br>
The margin between Cyprus sherry, which is historically bought and consumed by people on low incomes, and Spanish sherry, which is generally though not exclusively drunk by those on higher incomes, would be reduced to a small differential. Consumers would be compelled towards Spanish at the expense of Cyprus sherry.<br><br>
By contrast, the Chancellor and the Customs and Excise have told us that the Budget increases the retail price of a bottle of whisky or other spirits by 10p, and that the increase in the price of a bottle of vermouth, sherry or port is also 10p. By the Chancellor's own admission the increase in the price of a bottle of table wine is only 6p but the true increase for a blended sherry is 30p a bottle of the most popular type. That
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0572">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
is a large increase—30p compared with only 6p on a bottle of table wine.<br><br>
I could understand the Government's attitude if there were a booming market for sherry and vermouth and a declining market for table wine, but the opposite is true. The demand for sherry as a whole is falling, as is the demand for vermouth. Last year the sherry market declined by 14 per cent. That decline has been felt disproportionately in that sector called Cyprus sherry.<br><br>
Last year sales of Cyprus sherry fell by one-third, whereas the decline for the whole market—mainly Spanish sherry—was only 14 per cent. The fall in sales and therefore in production affects Cyprus sherry disproportionately.<br><br>
At Irlam 150 people work in the bottling and blending plant operated by the Co-operative Wholesale Society. A significant number of them will find that their jobs are put at risk by the change in markets. But their jobs will be put even more severely at risk by the Government's changes in excise duty—especially those contained in clause 5, which introduces a blending tax. In effect that tax is a tax on jobs in this county; it applies only if wines are blended here.<br><br>
The Co-operative Wholesale Society, as a responsible employer will try to redeploy its work-force. But what will happen to the people in Cyprus? I understand that in recent years considerable investment has take place in the production of sherry mainly for the British market. Many people are employed at that end of the chain of production. The effect on the people of Cyprus will be greater than the effect on the people at Irlam because their livelihood depends entirely on the production of sherry to be shipped to Irlam for blending. How many people in Cyprus will lose their jobs as a result of the new blending tax? I hope that the Government have estimated what the effect will be.<br><br>
I see that the Minister is gathering information all the time; I do not object, although I would have prefered it if he had known already. What are the options for the people of Cyprus whose jobs are being put at risk? I shall not detain the Committee by anticipating the Treasury's defence. I understand that the Minister of State is to reply to the debate. Let me tell him that bonding is not the answer to the problem. According to Cinzano it will not save the jobs of the people at Telford—neither can it save the jobs of the people at Irlam or in Cyprus. If the Minister chooses to deploy the argument about bonding despite my assertion, I shall go into the matter in greater detail.<br><br>
Because of their vendetta against Cinzano the Government are introducing a blending tax on all fortified wines—vermouth and sherry. Many people have now been caught up in that and are likely to lose their jobs.<br><br>
At best, the government are exporting jobs in the blending trade to Italy; at worst, they are increasing unemployment in both Italy and Cyprus, as well as in the United Kingdom. The Government's international aspirations know no bounds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Barney Hayhoe)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Committee if I intervene at this stage. I do not quarrel with the historical content of the speech made by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis). But I hope to be able to allay his main fear. Let me say at the outset that there is no question of a vendetta against Cinzano or anyone else.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
The clause blocks a duty loophole—as the hon. Gentleman put it—by making clear that the blending of two or more wines of different dutiable strengths constitutes the production of wine. I am advised that the amount of revenue at risk is about £10 million.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman said, the 1984 Budget reduced the duty on light wine in order to comply with the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the wine and beer case that we discussed at length last year. The result of that was to widen the duty differential between light and higher-strength wines. Companies—Cinzano in particular—realised that if they could blend a high-strength wine, containing 18 to 22 per cent alcohol, with a low-strength wine, containing less than 15 per cent alcohol, and pay duty on the items to be blended, the end result would be a total duty of some 20p a bottle less on the finished product. To prevent the potential revenue loss, Customs and Excise ruled that such blending constituted production, and, as the hon. Gentleman, said the matter was challenged in the courts.<br><br>
As it was pretty clear what the judgement would be to those who attended the hearing, the Chancellor decided to act in anticipation of the Law Lords' adverse decision and to prevent a loss of duty of more than £10 million per annum. The new provisions were incorporated in his Budget and brought into force on 26 March by Budget Resolutions.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman seemed particularly exercised by the prospect of double taxation. That did pose a problem at first. Wines came into the pipeline with the ditty paid and ready for blending, but the blending was not carried out, or was only partially carried out. To deal with the problem of stocks of wine for blending which were being held or in transit when the new provisions came into force, the Excise Duty (Wine) (Temporary Relief) Regulations 1985 provide for duty paid on the constituent wines to be set off against duty paid on the blended products. The regulations apply to wine blended before 1 July this year.<br><br>
However, neither the Customs nor the Government intend to impose double taxation after 1 July. If the blending is to be done in this country, it will be possible to bring the wine in and not pay the duty and there-fore not incur the bank charges—until the wine leaves in its blended condition. We want to ensure that the duty is the same on the blended product whether it comes blended from overseas, is blended in this country or indeed is not blended at all but is of equivalent strength. That seems a fair arrangement, and one which I hope will be practicable under the existing law. However, if problems arise I shall want to be told about them immediately.<br><br>
In March I met representatives of Cinzano with my noble Friend Lord Thorneycroft and my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Hawkesley), and we discussed the matter then. I should be happy to meet them again if they think that the law will impose a condition other than that which I have described.<br><br>
Jobs have also been mentioned. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was suggesting that we should continue the duty loophole to protect jobs at Telford. It would be nonsense to have a duty loophole that cost the Revenue £10 million or more just to protect 50 jobs. That would mean £200,000 a job.</span></p>
<p>5 p.m.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0573">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The £10 million is the total for the industry as a whole. That includes the jobs at Irlam and others located in many places in this country. It includes Martini, which has a larger share of the British market than Cinzano. I understand that Cinzano's share of that duty is £3 million.<br><br>
The arrangement that the Minister described sounds to me what members of the trade call bonding. That means that the wine is brought into this country, it is bonded, and no duty is paid until it is distributed. I am not sure how it is decided at which point duty becomes payable, but it is certainly after the blending. If the Minister meant bonding, will he assure the Committee that that applies to every importer, no matter how small?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that there were difficulties. I thought that I had described the situation fairly. Whether the wine is blended overseas or in this country the duty chargeable should be the same. The potential loophole that was opened up by the differential taxation in last year's Finance Bill should be closed and there should be equality of treatment.<br><br>
I am advised that such arrangements can be made and should cause no difficulty. I am not aware of any representations that mention difficulties. I have given an assurance that I shall look with urgency at any problem which may arise on the matter, because I hope that if any problem is foreseen we can overcome it. It is better overcome now in discussions between my officials and the firms concerned, because we can return to the matter on Report. I trust that the difficulties will be sorted out, and I shall do my best to ensure that they are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. John Marek <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am content with what the Minister said; it seems eminently reasonable at this stage. I am particularly pleased that discussions can be undertaken with the groups concerned, but they will have to be held fairly quickly because the Report stage of the Bill will be in about eight weeks' time.<br><br>
I have received a letter from the Co-operative Wholesale Society which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"In 1984, legislation was introduced which moved Sherry imported at 15 per cent alcohol from the Not Exceeding 15 (NE1 5) band to the 15-18 per cent band. At that time, importers were purchasing Sherry at 15 per cent alcohol and paying £113 per h/1 in duty. In that budget, duty on light wine was reduced to £90.50 per h/l in line with the European Court ruling vis-a-vis Beer. However, because of the change in terminology for 15 per cent wines, the duty in effect increases to £157.50 per h/1 equal to £3.74 per case of one dozen bottles, plus VAT."</p></blockquote>
So there is a problem there. There was a sharp increase in the duty payable by the trade.<br><br>
I do not like pushing sharp increases on any industry without notice and I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind. But, having said that, I hope that an agreement can be reached before Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stuart Randall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston upon Hull, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was pleased to hear what the Minister said and, like my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), I hope that we shall have a full and proper discussion on Report and that we shall have representations from the industry if matters do not work out satisfactorily.<br><br>
Although the Minister has assured us about double taxation, vermouths and sherries will be penalised quite heavily. The effect of such taxation over the years has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
been to reduce demand for those drinks. We have already discussed the effect of such taxation on jobs in distribution and retail outlets, and we are particularly concerned about that.<br><br>
I also received a copy of the letter from the Co-op. The letter referred to the effect of these and earlier Budget proposals on the consumption of Cyprus sherry. Cyprus sherry tends to be at the cheaper end of the sherry ranges. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) said that people on lower incomes drank cheaper sherry. My wife uses Cyprus sherry for cooking. That does not suggest that it is not palatable. It is good for cooking. One can gush the stuff into the old frying pan when cooking a steak on Saturday evenings. The proposal affects the As, Bs and C1s as well as the Ds and the Es.<br><br>
The drop in consumption is of great concern. I know that the Co-operative Wholesale Society is concerned that the severe tax changes in this year's and last year's Budgets are sufficiently high to make those kinds of sherries disappear from the shelves of Co-operative outlets. That would be sad, not only for this country but for the people of Cyprus who have traditionally supplied us with sherry. Their economy relies on that quite heavily. As we know, various advantages have been given to Cyprus in the past. In 1984, four million litres of Cyprus sherry were imported—considerably less than the six million in 1983. That is a substantial drop. Just as we have discussed tax on the working man's pint in the past, we are now talking about something similar.<br><br>
The Minister's reply to my hon. Friend's question about double taxation seemed to point to mere bookkeeping. Instead of paying the tax in the country where the product is produced and then paying another tax afterwards on blending, the Minister is suggesting that it should be paid in one lump afterwards. The Minister has given the Committee an assurance that there will be no increase and that the level will remain the same. Therefore, it is a bookkeeping matter and will not affect the level of taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. He is right to say that in that respect it is a bookkeeping matter. But there are other matters such as the importing of Cyprus wine on preferential terms. There is a history whereby we give Cyprus wine an advantage over Spanish sherry and that should be looked at long and hard before it is swept away.<br><br>
The other point is that we want to keep investment and productive capacity in this country. Perhaps the fiscal regime should be impartial, but would not my hon. Friends agree that if we can arrange for Cinzano once again to be blended in this country at Telford, rather than in Italy, we should support that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for those comments from my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek).<br><br>
The Minister has given the Committee useful reassurances on the issue and it is not worth pursuing points which we might otherwise have pursued except to say that the Cinzano briefing gives a good example of the effect of increased taxation on jobs in Telford, if this change were to go ahead. The consequences of such measures are significant and although we are talking about revenue of £10 million, the figures show that if the proposal goes ahead the loss to the Exchequer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0574">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
would be £1.5 million. That is a very significant annual figure. Therefore we must be careful.<br><br>
Will the Minister clarify a point made to me by the Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd? Mr. Thacker, Factory Manager, Wines and Spirits said in his letter about blending arrangements:
<br><blockquote><p>"The proposal now being put to Parliament is that if this practice is to be allowed to continue, then the resultant product would now carry duty equal to the amount payable on the higher alcohol part used in the blend."</p></blockquote>
That is extraordinary and although Mr. Thacker develops that point, I shall not pursue it in depth. However, he did say that it would be far better to have done this on an average basis. If such tax impositions are made on the higher alcohol part of a drink, that will be bad for producers because it will limit product ranges by not allowing them to do so much blending and mixing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood <span class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: No great significance should be read into the fact that I am now promulgated and assimilated by the ranks of the official Opposition.<br><br>
I find clause 5 offensive in a number of respects. First, it does not necessarily square with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury's statement on the Budget in April. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"As hon. Members study the main features of the Bill, I hope that they will be struck by the number of measures which carry forward the theme of tax reform and simplification which was started in last year's Finance Bill. I hope that they will be struck also by the range of measures designed to promote job creation."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 29 April 1985; Vol. 78, c. 26.]</p></blockquote>
I submit that the clause succeeds under neither head. It certainly does not simplify the system of taxation. As we have heard, it creates a further definition of the production of wine, by classifying as production the blending of wines of different strengths which attract different rates of duty. That new definition does not marry easily with the definition of the production of wine in the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979 as
<br><blockquote><p>"'the alcoholic fermentation of grapes",</p></blockquote>
which is correct, in my view.<br><br>
The new definition also entails not single but double rates of taxation on vermouths blended in the United Kingdom. Under clause 5, wines of different strengths imported into the United Kingdom for the purposes of blending will now have to pay duty on importation and again on the wine when it is blended. That cannot be described as a simplification of the tax system by any stretch of the imagination.<br><br>
The power of imposing double taxation will rest on the discretion not of Parliament but of Customs and Excise, which is at one remove from Parliament. That is because the only way in which companies that blend can avoid double taxation is if Customs and Excise agree to bonding arrangements, whereby duty is paid when the wine is sold. Thus anything done to the wine before it is sold is not subject to additional taxation.<br><br>
However, Customs and Excise can still decide whether to grant bonding arrangements, and it does not usually grant them to small or medium-sized companies producing fewer than 250,000 cases of wine per annum, which is a substantial volume.<br><br>
Clause 5 will not simplify the tax system or create jobs. Imposing double taxation on companies that blend in the United Kingdom will cause blending plants to be closed, with the consequent loss of jobs. In the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
Cinzano, 25 part-time workers have already left and by Christmas, 50 full-time workers will be at risk.<br><br>
Jobs will be lost, even though temporary relief has been granted up to 1 July and double taxation can be avoided through bonding, because duty is charged on the finished blended product and the rates on medium strength wine are higher than the separate rates charged on high and low strength wines on importation. So the financial incentive to blending will be removed by clause 5, and whatever happens, blending in the United Kingdom will cease.<br><br>
If clause 5 were dropped, the Government would be closer to achieving their objectives as stated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and instead of introducing new and confusing definitions for taxation which result in double taxation, which may be avoided only at the discretion of Customs and Excise, the Government would have a straightforward and much more sensible taxation system. More important, if clause 5 were dropped, instead of jobs and revenue for the Government being lost, new jobs could be created.<br><br>
Blending is not only an economic way in which to make vermouths, but it generates employment. Companies that blend need workers and they could take on new workers to blend. I am advised that there is considerable demand for blending in this country. Other vermouth companies had begun to blend before the Budget, and before beginning to blend, still other Montilla and Cyprus sherry companies were waiting for the outcome of the ruling in the other place referred to earlier. Even table wines could be blended in the United Kingdom, if it were economic to import grape must and dilute it. There is clear potential for blending in the United Kingdom and creating more jobs, which will now be created abroad as the result of clause 5.<br><br>
Finally, I fear that there is an EC aspect to clause 2. If I am right, blending became economic because the EC Court forced the Government to lower the tax rates on lower strength wines. By classifying blending as production, the Government have reasserted their discrimination against lower strength wines, or vermouths at least. More important, that puts the Scottish whisky industry at risk to a certain extent. After a long struggle, the Italians have just ended the whisky war by lowering VAT on whisky, but they could now reverse that, in retaliation against the United Kingdom Government's discriminatory treatment of vermouths.<br><br>
The whole issue is still in the European forum. Lord Cockfield, the EC Commissioner on taxation, is working on a programme of fiscal harmonisation, and I understand that a Green Paper may be issued in June. Double taxation and the wider issues of the movement of products across fiscal frontiers will be an important aspect of the programme, which will ultimately result in an EEC directive. I fear that the clause may run contrary to that and that soon the Government will have to take account of further changes.<br><br>
Does it make sense for the Government further to complicate the road to harmonisation by moving now on what they admit is a relatively minor issue when the whole area is about to be tackled by Lord Cockfield and his committee in Europe? Would not it be simpler and wiser to wait a little longer for the Green Paper and the subsequent directive? The clause is a bad one. It should not be in the Bill.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mark Fisher <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made some nice noises on double taxation which will have pleased all hon. Members, but I doubt whether the industry is much clearer about how it stands on this crucial issue. The Minister said, "I want to see that the duty chargeable will be the same." But earlier he suggested that whatever could be done to achieve that would be done. His remarks seem to fall far short of giving an undertaking or explaining to the Committee how he intended to protect the industry from double taxation. Had he discussed the matter with his officials when he made those remarks? Does he have a clear strategy for ensuring that there is no double taxation?<br><br>
I assume that the Minister is suggesting bonding arrangements. He has been asked how such arrangements would be ensured and whether he has the power to give instructions to Customs and Excise to ensure bonding arrangements for all blenders of vermouth and sherry who wish to have them, irrespective of the size and limits on bonding arrangements, as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) implied.<br><br>
The Minister will have to tell the Committee more before it can be satisfied that what he said today was not merely polite, kind and well-intentioned words intended to placate the Committee now, but part of a coherent strategy that he has worked out with his officials and which he knows how to implement to ensure that the industry does not suffer double taxation.<br><br>
Unless the Minister can satisfy the Committee in that way it will not be reassured that double taxation will not occur. Moreover, I doubt whether the industry will be reassured. The Minister owes us a detailed explanation of how he will ensure that double taxation does not occur. The Minister is shaking his head, so I suspect that we shall not be given that reassurance, that the Committee will remain completely dissatisfied and that we must look to much more substantial remarks from the Minister on Report.<br><br>
Double taxation is not the only problem with the clause. The fairness of blending and the redefinition of blending and production are further problems about which the Government have got themselves in an extraordinary tangle in the clause because of their ineptness last year. It should be clearly understood that the clause is in this year's Finance Bill because of ill-considered and ill-judged drafting by the Government last year. When last year's changes were drafted, the Government did not understand the opportunity that the provision gave the industry. By showing flair and initiative in business terms, the industry recognised the opportunity and exploited it. The Government are supposed to be in favour of business initiative and of producers and employers taking advantage of trade opportunities by creating jobs, more output and more profits. The Government's faulty and inept drafting last year created a business opportunity, but when people try to use it productively, the Government scurry for cover by using an inelegant, awkwardly and curiously worded clause to try to close a loophole because, to their horror their ignorance has cost then £10 million. They have been stupid.<br><br>
I was sorry to miss the openings remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis). No doubt he referred to the matter as "the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
Cinzano clause". In that case, the Minister of State undoubtedly would be cast in the role of Leonard Rossiter who ended up spilling drinks and collapsing all over the place. Hon. Members: "where is Joan Collins?" There are doubtless members of the Committee who would like to volunteer for that role. Others may feel that those Members' qualities are not entirely similar to those of Miss Collins.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Chairman is like Joan Collins.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fisher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend with his greater sense of aesthetic values suggest that there are qualities in the Chairman which more readily apply. I shall stick with the important matter not of the casting of the Minister of State, but of his stumbling and the unintentional terrible mistake that he made last year which he is trying to put right now.<br><br>
The Minister has not addressed the matter of blending. When wines or liquors are blended, why is not the average of the two rates of duty taken? That would be logical, sensible and equitable, but the Government do not do that. The Committee is owed an explanation and justification.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, it seems that I have misunderstood the matter too. I thought that the Government were trying to tax the alcohol content of the finished product, so that if the blending was on a 50:50 or 3:1 basis it would be averaged accordingly. If there is a certain amount of alcohol in the finished product and it falls into the group for which duty would be payable if it were imported, the duty paid on the blended product should be the same as if the product were imported.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fisher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) that that would be the sensible way to proceed. However, the Government are not doing that. The clause says that when two things at different rates of duty are blended, the blended rate of duty should be the higher. That makes no logical sense. The Minister made no attempt to justify such nonsense. Therefore, I should be grateful if he would explain the rationale behind that blending change.<br><br>
The Minister should explain, too, the definition of production. The Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979 had a perfectly acceptable definition that there should be a material change in the product through the alcoholic fermentation of grapes. That is succinct, elegant and a sufficient definition of what production involves and there is no cause to change it, except that the Government found that by their actions last year they had to close the loophole.<br><br>
Because of that alteration, the clause, through enormously tortuous logic, has a new and far less satisfactory definition of the means of production. The Minister owes us an explanation about that and about the fairness and logic behind the blending rate of duty. He must give us a far more substantive and coherent statement about how he will get out of the double taxation trap.</span></p>
<p>5.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) was treading on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0576">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
dangerous ground when he likened the Minister of State to the late Leonard Rossiter spilling vermouth on Joan Collins. I do not wish to associate myself with that remark because it might be dangerous, at the time of splits, groups, factions and—dare I say it—tendencies in the Conservative party, to compare the Minister of State with the late Leonard Rossiter, who achieved his fame as a proponent of Rising Damp.<br><br>
The Minister was kind enough to say that my brief history of the production and blending of fortified wines in this country was accurate. He did not disagree with anything that I said about it. I could have said that Cinzano's decision to blend vermouth at Telford was not new. The company had blended vermouth in this country—it was contracted out to an agent—more than ten years ago. It stopped blending as a result of changes in excise duty in 1976. No one should think that the decision to stop blending in this country was a result of a deliberate change introduced by the Labour Government. The decision was the result of the intro-duction of several bands of excise duty resulting from the first round of interference in this issue by the Common Market. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) should bear that in mind, because he cited those changes as a beneficial effect of the Common Market. It was not. The Common Mar-ket's interference in the excise duties levied on alcoholic drinks in this country is malevolent and not beneficial to our economy.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire was also mistaken in his references to the risk that the Italian Government might take retaliatory action. I do not think that there is any risk that the Italian Government will change the recent arrangements for taxing whisky. Those new arrangements were widely welcomed by all parties in this country. Cinzano men-tioned that in its brief. I advise the Liberal Member of Parliament for Roxburgh and Berwickshire—I hope that he will not be too upset—that he should approach such briefs with scepticism. I do not think that Cinzano is right. I do not wish the Minister to think that we are putting only the arguments of vested interests, because they are not all correct. That does not mean that they are all wrong. Some of the arguments have much validity.<br><br>
I did not refer to the period up to 1 July because it is not relevant. The Minister of State explained the temporary, transitional arrangements which apply up to the beginning of July. We are not debating what applies in that period, and it does not concern the Opposition. We are anxious about what will happen after the beginning of July.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central referred to £10 million, and the Minister said that the potential loss was £10 million. I suspect that in calculating that figure, the Minister's officials are taking into account all the blending of fortified wines that is done in this country. That is a false figure, because blending has always taken place here. I illustrate my point by citing the case of the Co-Operative Wholesale Society. The tax lost on blended Cyprus sherry last year through that loophole should not be taken into account in that calculation. I shall not ask the Minister to give us those figures this evening.<br><br>
For reasons which I shall return to later, I approach any figures from the Treasury on this subject with great
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
caution. I ask the Minister of State to write to me and explain how the Treasury calculated the figure of £10 million. We are worried about the penalty which is being imposed on a production activity in this country. The Minister calls it production and wishes to tax it. I am prepared to call it production and be glad that it is not taxed.<br><br>
I want to see more jobs in this country. The arrangements which applied before the Budget saved some jobs and historically have encouraged jobs in blenders such as the Co-operative Wholesale Society. The Minister says that he is surprised at the Opposition's criticisms today. He said that he was especially surprised—I do not think that I misquote him—because he thought that the issue had been resolved in his discussions with representatives of Cinzano in April. But Cinzano has written to us since then and repeated its criticisms, so the discussions clearly did not allay the fears of those working for Cinzano (UK).<br><br>
We were also approached by the Co-operative Wholesale Society. it is possible that the Minister did not hear from the CWS before today, but he cannot say that he has not heard from anyone. He said that he has heard nothing from anyone about the issue since his meeting with Cinzano. I am not sure about the exact date of his meeting, but he will remember that I referred to this matter on Second Reading, and I have heard nothing from the Government, either at the end of that debate—which I did not expect—or subsequently, in writing. If the Minister thought that there was nothing in it, and that fears were groundless, I should have thought that he would write to me.<br><br>
The Minister of State has been receiving messages thoughout the debate, but I am never sure whether we are supposed to refer to the people sitting at the Chairman's shoulder, who are probably regarded as invisible. Other people are present in the Room as well as members of the Standing Committee. I have been receiving silent but visible messages from people who are clearly dissatisfied with what the Minister has said. They do not think that he is right in his assurances and think that he is mistaken. His assurances related both to people working for Cinzano in this country and the people in Cyprus.<br><br>.
I am told that the Minister's assurances will not work in practice because the bonding arrangement cannot be obtained as a matter of right. As I understand it, the bonding arrangement is given by the Commissioners of Customs and Excise at their discretion. In other words, an importer cannot say to them, "I am importing this fortified wine. I am going to blend it and I will pay the tax when I have done that", which is what the Minister appeared to think happens. The CWS cannot tell the commissoners, "We have done it this way for years and want to continue" and think that everything will be the same as it has been for years, which is in effect what the Minister told us was so.<br><br>
I understand that the commissioners excercise their discretion on bonding arrangments only if the through-put is equivalent to at least 250,000 cases. Production of blended Cyprus sherry by the Co-operative Wholesale Society is fewer than 250,000 cases a year. So the Minister is mistaken—I do not suggest that he has deliberately mislead us—in his belief and his assurance that there is no cause for fear.<br><br>
In the case of the Cinzano factory at Telford, the Minister argued that £10 million, or even E3 million, is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0577">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
a large amount to be given through a tax loophole to save 50 full-time jobs. I remind him that some temporary part-time jobs have already gone west. As my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West said, the Government are not setting off the cost of unemployment; if those people lose their jobs, the Government have to pay, willy-nilly, not only through unemployment benefit but in lost tax and national insurance contributions.<br><br>
Once again, a Minister has given us the narrow form of accounting that we always get when we discuss unemployment costs. I remind him that unemployment is very high in Telford. I saw a report in <i>The Birmingham Post</i> of 2 May, which is circulated in Telford, that began:
<br><blockquote><p>"Telford and Bridgnorth are still the unemployment blackspots of the West Midlands.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Last month's figures … showed the Telford and Bridgnorth travel to work area had … 21.7 per cent of the working population unemployed."</p></blockquote>
Fifty extra people is going the wrong way, but that will be the effect of clause 5.<br><br>
We must also include in proper accounting of the cost of the clause the lost sales that will result. We assume that if all the Cinzano is blended in Italy the same amount will be sold as if it were blended in the United Kingdom. But that may not be so. The market is declining and we are worried that there will be lost sales, therefore, and lost excise duty to the Government as a result.<br><br>
With regard to the import of Cyprus sherry for blending in this country, the people of Cyprus are most worried. The Minister may not have received representations, but I am told that the Government of Cyprus are most concerned about the effect of clause 5 on employment in their island. Traditionally, the United Kingdom has been the major buyer of Cyprus wines, and of all the Cyprus wines exported to this country, fortified wine—Cyprus sherry—accounts for 70 per cent. There are 100,000 people in Cyprus who are directly or indirectly dependent on the wine industry for their livelihood, and 22 per cent of them work in agriculture, engaged in the growing of vines. Their products are the major source of income for Cyprus, being the third biggest earner of foreign exchange for their Government. In 1984, the exports of Cyprus sherry to the United Kingdom earned more than £2 million for that Government, and I remind the Committee that Cyprus's balance of trade is in deficit with the United Kingdom. We sell more to Cyprus than we buy from it. Indeed, its imports from the United Kingdom are twice the value of its exports to this country, and it expects that the position will deteriorate even more as a result of the admission of Spain to the Common Market and clause 5.<br><br>
Clause 5 seems to go too far and to be that little extra straw which need not be added. Today, a report was published in the trade press stating that Emvais switching its production. Previously, it has used Cyprus sherries for its fortified wine, but that report states that within the next couple of months it will change its source. The report says that this decision
<br><blockquote><p>"is said to have been prompted by higher duty rates brought in at the last Budget and problems with high and low-strength blending which have hit Cyprus sherry particularly hard."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, we shall want to examine the Minister's assurance very carefully and to discuss it with those
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
who are most affected. The results of our discussions with the Government will be watched most carefully, not only by those who work in the blending factories and plants in this country but by the people of Cyprus. They will also be watched most carefully by the Cypriot community here.<br><br>
I am prepared to accept an assurance from the Minister that he does not believe that anyone will be disadvantaged as a result of clause 5. He has promised to consider the matter following what has been said today, and I am sure that he will be as good as his word. I ask him to communicate not only with the trade but with the Opposition, and I shall be glad if he will write to me before Report. Otherwise, we shall certainly seek to raise the matter again on Report.<br><br>
I am especially anxious because of the history—a subject on which the Minister congratulated me. Clause 5 has been drafted by the people who last year drafted the clause which led to a loophole. The Minister has accepted that it was all a mistake, but the same people have drafted clause 5 and we are asked to believe that they can get it right this year when they got it wrong last year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been interesting for the paradoxes of some of the contributions made to it. I am not sure whether the Opposition officially believe that, a loophole having been found to exist, it would be proper for it to be closed, to use the hon. Gentleman's words, or whether their position is that the loophole should never have been created in the first instance. They seem to be saying that the loophole should not have been created in the first instance but, having been created, it should certainly be kept. Perhaps that is a position of logic which their intellectual processes will justify.<br><br>
I thought that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) excelled himself. I know that Liberal policy tends to vary, depending on which constituency in the country one is in, but I have never seen it vary quite as fast as it did between Tuesday and today. On Tuesday, the hon. Gentleman was arguing for the Liberal party that the system for taxation of alcohol towards which we should move is that the same unit of taxation should apply to the unit of alcohol, whatever its form. But today the hon. Gentleman has argued in favour of a different tax to apply if alcohol is blended in this country regardless of whether the facility of the loophole that has been described is used. He seemed to be strongly in favour of the differential that flowed from last year's Act being taken advantage of. I shall leave the hon. Gentleman to make his own intellectual justification of the vagaries of his position.<br><br>
5.45 p.m.<br><br>
However, I really cross swords with the hon. Gentleman on one issue. He said that the provisions of clause 5 could be used to justify the Italians in discriminating against their Scotch whisky imports. In making such a remark, the hon. Gentleman does a grave disservice to the Scotch whisky industry. As he tamely read out a brief from that industry two days ago, it is surprising that he should now seek to give credence to an unfortunate and wholly inaccurate interpretation of that sort.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the Liberal party representative in my own way; I do not need the assistance of the hon. Gentleman for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours).<br><br>
Opposition Members have spoken about the representations that they have received from the Co-operative Wholesale Society. I thought that I had made it clear that, although I had not seen them then, I shall examine them carefully. I believe that any practical difficulties can be overcome. Although the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire was wrong in many respects, I feel that his point about bonding facilities was correct. The CWS has bonding facilities at Irlam; there should be no problem about that. Any suggestions that the provisions of clause 5 will affect employment there are surely ill-founded. But, as I said, I have not yet seen the details; I shall consider them and return to the matter later. I have been forthcoming about my intentions, and I hope that the Committee will support the clause standing part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a non-party point; we must try to do what is right and best for the country. Let us consider the operation at Irlam and the blending of Cyprus sherry. Will clause 5 mean that the duty payable on the product coming out of Irlam is greater? Let us assume that the Minister is right in saying that the CWS can bond sherries when it imports them and that it does not have to pay the duty immediately. The society can bring the sherries into Irlam, put them into bond, blend them and sell the product to the retail trade. Does the clause make the position worse for the CWS?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already explained precisely what is done. If people at Irlam were to take advantage of the loophole in question, clearly clause 5 would affect them. But if they take wine of different strengths into bond and blend them, there is no reason why the duty paid on the wine coming out of bond should be different from the duty paid for wine of the same strength coming in without passing through bond.<br><br>
I repeat that I am quite prepared to look at the detail here. It will be to the advantage of the Committee if I look at the detailed representations and take advice from the experts. I hope that there will be no difficulties, but, if there are, I shall of course say so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's assurance. He has been very generous and willing to meet us. We shall contact the representatives of the CWS, who are still dissatisfied, because they believe that blended Cyprus sherries will be adversely affected by clause 5. However, we do not intend to press the matter now, so I suggest that we allow the clause to stand part of the Bill and discuss the matter with the Minister before Report. Perhaps he will be good enough to receive a deputation, if that is what the CWS wants. I am happy to see that the Minister nods his agreement.</span></p>

amendment No. 11, in page 4, line 13, leave out from "on" to the end of Clause and add "1st September 1985".<br><br>
I doubt whether this clause will delay the Committee in the same way as clause 5 has done, although it may raise one or two important issues. It could be called the clause that deals with water in the workers' beer, because its purpose is to prevent the addition of various substances to beer—presumably, water—and creates certain criminal offences in relation to section 52 of the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979.<br><br>
I suspect that many Opposition Members show a certain northern prejudice in thinking that, whenever we drink southern beer, we are drinking watered-down beer. That, of course, would not be covered by the provision. The other night, the Minister of State made a kind offer to take members of the Committee for a drink, and we can only hope that the drink will not be watered-down beer. We would not be wet in any sense. But we also hope that we shall have the pleasure of enjoying northern beer on that occasion.<br><br>
The clause deals with the addition of substances to beer, and the amendment relates to the operation of paragraphs 3 and 4 of schedule 3. Subsection (2) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Paragraphs 3 and 4 of Schedule 3 to this Act shall come into operation on such day as the Commissioners of Customs and Excise may by order … appoint."</p></blockquote>
Why do not we fix a particular date for the operation of these powers? If there is a major problem, why do not the Government fix the date so that the commissioners know when they can get on with the job, rather than leaving the matter open?<br><br>
The Minister will tell us that the basic provisions of this legislation were brought in in 1979 with all-party support; he will say that all we are doing is to amend and update that legislation.<br><br>
I do not want to delay the Committee, but will the Minister tell us why, if the Government feel that the commissioners should have that power, a date is not specified? Amendment No. 11 seeks to add a date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said in moving amendment No. 11, it would remove the com-missioners' discretion on the time of bringing into force the new measures on the determination of beer duty and the restrictions on adding substances to beer.<br><br>
The purpose of the discretion is to allow full consultation with the trade on the details of the changes. Hon. Members would wish such changes always to be brought in with as much consultation as possible. The consultations have started, and Customs and Excise officials envisage no difficulty in completing them well before the end of the year. It would have been simple to specify in the Bill an early operative date, as the amendment suggests, but it would have been contrary to long-standing practice not to introduce technical changes in beer duty without full consultation.<br><br>
Because we want genuine consultation, we felt it inappropriate to impose a rigid time constraint. The amendment would require the relevant statutory instruments to be laid during the summer recess as statutory instruments cannot be made before Royal Assent, and that would restrict the possibility of parliamentary scrutiny.<br><br>
I trust that the consultations will proceed and that the regulations will be brought into effect before the

end of the year. I see no real difficulty, and I hope that in view of that explanation the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I accept the Minister's explanation, but a small point of principle arises here. It is bad practice to allow matters to be dealt with by civil servants without parliamentary scrutiny, without good reason.<br><br>
I understand that statutory instruments, Orders-in-Council and so on have to face parliamentary scrutiny. However, regulations are provided for many times in the Bill, and I believe—I am open to correction—that regulations can be enacted before Parliament approves them. An example is the concessions applied by the Inland Revenue. Parliament has no real say on those, and so, in principle, I like Parliament always to have the last say.<br><br>
However, I think that the Minister has a case here because of the problems of the summer recess. I shall not be too upset if the amendment is not made at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that it would expedite our proceedings if we agreed to withdraw the amendment, but I must make two brief points. First, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) said, the importance of parliamentary scrutiny should never be overlooked by a Committee of this sort. Secondly, we all accept the need for the Government to consult. Obviously, the Government do not need legislative authority to carry out that consultative process. However, we ask that they carry it out fully and speedily, and that we have an opportunity to look at the fruit of that consultation later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

AMENDMENTS OF ALCOHOLIC LIQUOR DUTIES ACT 1979</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 101, line 8, leave out paragraph 3.<br><br>
Like the previous amendments and amendments Nos. 13, 14 and 15, this is a probing amendment. We are asking why there is a need to change the legislation, whether the process of change would be assumed by the process of consultation with the industry and whether that will be taking place.<br><br>
The schedule shifts some of the power for tax assessment from the commissioners to the industry and the brewers. Perhaps the Minister will explain why that is happening and what the effect will be in terms of revenue, the collection of revenue and staff.<br><br>
We are concerned that the consumer and the industry are protected. I am sure that the industry and the Minister will recognise that it is important to stamp out any unscrupulous activities. We are not saying that they happen; indeed, we are sure that such examples are rare. However, it is important that those safeguards are built in. The amendments seek an explanation of the changes from the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This paragraph makes provision for brewers to calculate and declare their own liability to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
beer duty, and provides powers for the commissioners to make appropriate regulations concerning the time and manner of payment. The amendment implicit in the schedule will come into effect on a date to be fixed by the commissioners.<br><br>
The beer duty for each brew becomes due immediately on being charged by the Customs and Excise officer at the brewery. The commissioners may, and often do, permit the aggregate charge to be made at the end of the month rather than on a brew-by-brew basis, which seems sensible. The duty is now the only major Customs and Excise revenue raiser which is assessed entirely by the department's officers.<br><br>
The change would create a system in which the trader would account for the duty. It would bring the brewers into line with VAT and with other Excise traders, and offers them the opportunity for much greater dependence on their commercial records, many of which are now computerised, in their dealings with Customs and Excise.<br><br>
The arrangements whereby payment of duty by brewers is usually deferred to the 25th day of the month following that in which the beer is brewed are not affected. The Brewers Society has been fully consulted on these outline proposals for self-accounting and has accepted the change. The society recognises that present charging arrangements are somewhat anachronistic and it welcomes the opportunity for wider dependence on its commercial records.<br><br>
The Committee will also be interested in the views of the small, independent brewers. The Small Independent Brewers' Association has also been kept informed. At first it expressed concern but in view of further proposals from the Customs and Excise only a few weeks ago it has written to say that
<br><blockquote><p>"the simplifications to paperwork will be welcomed by our members."</p></blockquote>
Both the big battalions and the small independents seem to be in reasonable tune with the proposals. There is no revenue cost attached to them and their net effect will probably be a staff saving of about ten man years. The accounting will now be done within the industry, with some advantage to the industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the proposal is going to save the Inland Revenue ten man years it will probably cost the industry ten man years. I wonder by how much beer will have to go up. It may not go up by much. The schedule is complicated and I have not read through all its Acts to see what it deals with. I hope that the price of beer will not go up greatly and that when the beer companies raise their prices in the summer and autumn they will not say, "The Government have switched the accounting systems so that duty is more like VAT, and you know what VAT is like nowadays." We all know that VAT is an impossible system that causes mountains of paper at great expense and to no effect. That is how I see the present VAT system.<br><br>
I can understand how the proposal fits in with the Government's philosophy. They want to do as little as possible and make everyone else do as much as possible. The measure cuts down the Civil Service. The Government will be able to say, "Aren't we good? We've achieved more efficiency." However, it will be achieved at the expense of greater inefficiency in the industry.<br><br>
I am not convinced that that burden will not fall on the brewing industry if the schedule is accepted and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0580">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
change is made. I could be convinced but the Minister would probably have to give me a detailed answer, which is not possible in Committee. However, the Minister must have looked at the matter and asked his advisers about it. I am sure that no Minister would want to encumber an industry with a lot of extra work.<br><br>
I accept that the Minister said that he consulted the industry, but there are ways and ways of having consultations. If the industry is happy about the measure I hope that it will not make excuses when it puts up the price of beer in the autumn or in the winter, saying "It's not really our fault. We have all this extra work. Without it we would not have had to increase beer at all. Part of the increase is because of all this extra administration." That is one point that worries me.<br><br>
My next point may be completely spurious but it arises because I am not sure how the duty on beer is assessed. Will there be greater opportunity for evasion of duty as a result of the measure? The Minister shakes his head and I should be grateful for a short reply later. I shall therefore be brief in making my point.<br><br>
Will there be a greater possibility of evasion not by the responsible companies but by some of the others somewhere along the line? A Minister in any Government ought to ask his advisers about the effects of legislation. I should welcome, if possible, a categoric statement from the Minister that the changes in the schedule will not result in more possibilities for evasion of duty than existed previously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to refer briefly to the effect of the provision on the industry. I wonder whether the commissioner's role in deciding whether anything has been added to beer will impose extra paper work on the industry. How will the system work? Will Customs and Excise staff have to go to the breweries carrying instruments to test specific gravities? If so, how often will that happen?<br><br>
Furthermore, if there are to be no brake points in the system to prevent evasion, it will have to be run pretty tightly, and that could impose a large bureaucratic workload on the industry. What action will the Government take to ensure that evasion does not take place—that lorries are not hijacked on the MI, with vehicles running alongside them and adding stuff to the casks? One's imagination runs wild.<br><br>
Frankly, I cannot see how the provision will work, and I should be grateful if the Minister could explain about evasion and the load on the industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that the schedule has nothing to do with hijacking on the M1—he must have a lively imagination.<br><br>
Hon. Members have asked about the burden on the industry. As I said, the provision was the subject of consultation with the Brewers Society. It will probably mean less paper work over all. It will mean a reliance on the company's records and a proper control system for those records. As I said, I am advised that there are no revenue costs and therefore no possibility of greater evasion. The measure is a useful updating of the way in which the duties are collected, which the industry accepts as being sensible. It may mean that better account is taken of the computerised records of some large companies and that the process is made more efficient as a result.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, we are grateful to the Minister for his explanation. My hon. Friends have raised some important points, especially about the potential costs to the industry and the impact on the consumer. I also share the Minister's delight at the imagination displayed by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hell drivers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I never thought that we would be discussing hell drivers on the motorway on this amendment. But it is a compliment to the quality of the Committee that we have. Given that my hon. Friend represents the port area of Hull, I thought that he might go still further; he may even have witnessed sea water being put into beer, for example.<br><br>
We shall watch the impact on the industry and shall take into account the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). But having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>6.15p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 101, leave out lines 24 to 37.<br><br>
My knowledge about watering the workers' beer will probably become one of the main features of our proceedings. Certainly I hope that I have been able to bring it to hon. Members' attention over the past half hour.<br><br>
The purpose of paragraph 4 of schedule 3 is to change the penalty imposed on those found guilty of watering beer or adding any other substance to it. Under the 1979 Act, such a person would be liable on summary conviction to a penalty of £50. The Government now propose that a person
<br><blockquote><p>"who adds anything to beer on his entered premises shall be liable on summary conviction to a penalty of level 3 on the standard scale".</p></blockquote>
We ask the Minister whether, as we suspect, that is simply an updating of the 1979 Act, and whether he considers it a sufficient penalty.<br><br>
I should also like to ask about the term "entered premises", which would be deleted by our amendment. Does it significantly change the previous definition of offences? Entered premises are defined in section 52(2) of the 1979 Act. But does the schedule impose restrictions on existing powers, and would it be necessary in certain circumstances to contemplate extending them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The provisions in the schedule would, as the hon. Gentleman says, amend the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979. They would also strengthen the law to ensure effective revenue control without an undue use of official resources and while meeting legitimate trade needs. That brings me back to what was said in our last debate. We want to ensure that the modern techniques used by the brewing industry do not lead to a slackening of control.<br><br>
I am not an expert on brewing but I understand that such techniques involve finishing beer away from the brewery in which it was originally brewed. As the law stands it would be difficult, if not impossible, to prevent a proliferation of premises where additions could be made to the beer. Unless there was a large increase in the number of official control staff there would be a danger of widespread and uncontrolled dilution, which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0581">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
no doubt sends a ripple of horror around the Committee Room. I hope, therefore, that there will be widespread support for measures which seek to avert such a danger.<br><br>
I am advised that the penalties were updated by the Criminal Law Act 1977 and the Criminal Justice Act 1982. A number of bands are laid down and from time to time updated. The appropriate penalty in this case is level 3, which imposes £400 as the maximum fine.<br><br>
I hope that, from that explanation, the Committee will accept that proper precautions should be taken against the widespread and uncontrolled dilution of beer and against additions or changes being made to it away from the control premises.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little perturbed about the scale of fines. The large breweries will find £400 a trifle, particularly those which can afford to pay £50,000 to the Conservative party in an attempt to influence the result of elections. Perhaps the Government thought that they should do something about the original £50 fine and that doubling it was not enough. But to the large brewers the difference between £50 and £400 is peanuts—in fact, it is probably only one peanut. There should be a real deterrent to brewers to prevent the wilful watering of beer, or adding substances that are not allowed—I am not accusing any large breweries of doing that because they have a high reputation to maintain—and our business as legislators is to provide sufficient deterrence for anyone who wishes to go beyond the bounds of the law.<br><br>
Depending on a company's structure and its lines of management communication a manager could make profits by watering the beer, unbeknown to the company. Even in such a case, a £400 penalty is not a sufficient deterrent. Is it possible to devise a system whereby a wilful disregard of the law by a company or an individual for whom £400 is peanuts would incur a much bigger penalty?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can help the Committee. The level 3 penalties are not changing between the part that is being deleted from the old Act as a result of this provision of the schedule and what is being inserted.<br><br>
The real penalty against the brewer is that the beer is liable to forfeiture. It can be confiscated. The commissioners of Customs and Excise are not allowed to drink anything that is so confiscated—that should be put clearly on the record. I presume that such beer is destroyed. If the company takes such grave action as that to which the hon. Gentleman referred, that additional penalty exists. It was available under the old provisions and it is merely being carried forward. We are making a technical extension to ensure that the modern methods used do not create any opportunity for such evil practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to take up the question of forfeiture as it puts the issue into perspective. My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Merek) made a valid point that £50 or £400 is no deterrent to a company with a substantial turnover.<br><br>
If water or chemicals are added to beer, would only the affected barrels be confiscated, or would it be the beer currently in production, or the whole of the bond store? It is difficult to assess whether the provisions are sufficiently powerful to prevent abuse.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how much beer would be involved or what its value would be. It could be a lot or a little and I do not know its value. Will the Inland Revenue be able to impound the beer, store it, destroy it and then charge the company for that process? That would be a deterrent. When beer is seized, there are often outcries about how that should be done and demands that the penalties are sufficient. I am not completely happy about this and I should like to be reassured.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions should be brief, as that is their nature.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Miss Fookes. I thought that the intervention was long. The Commissioner and the Customs and Excise will have the authority to decide and we will not be able to do so. We must have a deterrent against the abuse of adding certain products to beer. The Minister implied that forfeiture would be adequate. Perhaps we should table another amendment to cover transport and other costs.<br><br>
Schedule 3(4)(2) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"A brewer for sale may, on his entered premises and in accordance with regulations under section 49 above, add to beer brewed on those premises—
<ol>
<li>water;</li>
<li>finings for the purpose of clarification; and</li>
<li>such other substances as may be sanctioned by the Commissioners."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
I wonder whether any added substances have health implications. Many people, when choosing their beers, take such factors into account. What chemicals could be added that would have a bad effect on health?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's intervention illustrates the paradox to which I referred earlier. The amendment would weaken control. We have to decide whether to strengthen control. The strengthening provision is in the schedule. I thought that the hon. Gentleman made it clear that the amendment was probing. The amendment would remove that strengthening. The tenor of the debate has shown that such controls should not be weakened and that we should have sufficient powers to deal with people behaving improperly.<br><br>
The powers exist and they are not being changed. The Committee has either to decide to extend the control, as I have suggested, or not to extend it which would weaken the control because of developments within the industry. I hope that the Committee will agree that the amendment should not be made and I hope that it will be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, we have had a wide debate on the amendment and I am sure that the Committee is grateful for the contributions from my hon. Friends who were able to put a wider perspective on the amendment.<br><br>
One difficulty with Committee proceedings is in tabling a probing amendment which sometimes has no great virtue other than to allow a small debate to take place to enable Opposition Members to understand the Government's intentions.<br><br>
I share the Minister's view that amendment would weaken control. Therefore, following the satisfactory and courteous reply from the Minister, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment no. 14, in page 101, line 39, leave out "may" and insert "shall".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 15, in page 102, line 9, leave out "may" and insert "shall".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The grouping of amendments Nos. 14 and 15 is wise and I am sure it shows the strength, Miss Fookes, of your Chairmanship and will enable us to expedite consideration of the Committee.<br><br>
Two subsections of the schedule attempt to provide a control system for abuse that may exist within the industry. Our previous debates show that there is much common purpose to ensure that abuse does not occur in the industry.<br><br>
One major question arises from those subsections. In line 39, powers are given to the Commissioners to make regulations to deal with the possible abuse of beer as it leaves premises or as it is imported from outside the United Kingdom. Why is that power given to the Commissioners in the form of a power and not as a duty? Our amendment seeks to make that duty upon the Commissioners to bring forward the necessary regulations. The same point relates to line 6, page 102 because in dealing with the transportation of beer, again the Commissioners are given the power to make regulations but not if they do not have a duty.<br><br>
Amendments. Nos. 14 and 15 seek to impose upon the Commissoners a duty to make those regulations. If we are to safeguard the consumer and the good name of the industry it may be sensible to impose a duty rather than have a power.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are important because the public needs to be reassured. Just for once I hope that the Government will accept the amendment and say that regulations "shall" be made. Many people worry about whether water is put in their beer, or not put in their beer. The amendment will affect nothing else because the regulations are going to be made anyway, at least I hope that is what the Minister has in mind. Therefore, in a spirit of generosity I shall be interested to hear whether the Minister will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment, as the hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) said, is to impose an obligation instead of a discretion for Customs and Excise to make regulations for additions to beer and its transport after it leaves the premises where it was brewed. The reason for the permissive nature of the legislation are similar to those to whom I referred earlier. As I said then, the established practice is to make significant technical changes to the administration of beer duty only after full and prior consultation with the brewing industry. Customs and Excise propose to make those regulations when the necessary consultations have been completed. They are now in progress and it is confidently expected that they will be completed before the end of this year.<br><br>
However, the legal advice given to me is tht if I responded to the alluring invitation of the hon. Member for Wrexham, who put his point with charm and per-sauasiveness, it would imply a legal obligation on the Customs and Excise to make the regulations at a very
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
early date, thus putting an undue and unnecessary time constraint on the consultative process, and one wants the consultation to be carried out properly.<br><br>
Moreover, I am also advised that the use of "may" conforms with the normal drafting of regulation-making powers in Customs and Excise legislation, which has been accepted by Parliament in the past. In other words, making the power discetionary would be absolutely in accordance with the precedents followed by previous Administrations for very many years. I assure the Committee that the regulations will be made properly.<br><br>
It would be somewhat sad to appear to depart from the general consultative process and so disturb the good relations which exist between Customs and Excise officials and people in the brewing industry, which might be implicit if Parliament insisted on having in the Bill "shall" rather than "may". Committee Members may now perhaps understand why I should perfer the amendment to be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am persuaded by the Minister's second argument that the use of "may" is the normal custom and practice so why should we change it. I am also prepared to accept that there is no need to change the word to "shall" as the commissioners will carry out the responsibilities.<br><br>
However, the Minister's first argument was less persuasive. If "shall" is inserted, the consultation process could and, I think, would go on alongside, and I am sure that the Minister would make it his responsibility to ensure that it did.<br><br>
I noted what the Minister said about custom and practice and what happens in relation to the industry. With that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 104, leave out lines 19 to 21.<br><br>
This is another probing amendment. Paragraph 4 of the schedule amends the existing legislation for collecting duty on oil produced in the United Kingdom. I am not sure why the Government wish to delete the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"produced in the United Kingdom".</p></blockquote>
I should be grateful if the Minister would give the reason.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) is right to raise the matter because paragraph 8 of the notes on clauses and schedules merely states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Paragraph 4 of the Schedule deletes the words 'produced in the United Kingdom' from paragraph I I of Schedule 3".</p></blockquote>
That does not tell people much that they did not know from studying the Bill. Therefore, I am happy to have the opportunity—briefly I hope—to explain the implication.<br><br>
At present, the duty on imported oil in pipeline is secured by bond because pipelines are included in the bonded warehouse system. After the new system of control of oil duties is introduced on 15 October 1985, cross-country pipelines will no longer form part of that warehouse system. However, by virtue of the amendments to the law contained in schedule 4, there will be circumstances in which oil in those pipelines becomes liable to an additional charge for duty. If the oil is home-produced, the existing law allows security to be required, but not if the oil is imported. Therefore, the commissioners need the power to require security for additional duty to cover imported oil. The amounts will be small, and they will be covered by adjustments of the terms of existing bonds.<br><br>
The provision ensures that changes in the way in which duty on oil is collected will not cause oil in pipeline to receive more preferential treatment than imported oil. It is a technical point, but again one on which the Committee would wish there to be no discrimination against home-produced oil which would occur if the amendment made by paragraph 4 were not made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has expressed mild criticism about the notes on clauses. I had refrained from criticising because we are most grateful to the Government for their willingness to provide notes on clauses. It would have been ungracious to have said that they were not good enough. However, it would be helpful if the Minister could ask someone to go through the notes on clauses in future to ensure that they are a little more explicit.<br><br>
I suspect that sometimes the notes on clauses are written by people who are so familiar with the subject that they understand it and do not realise that we have difficulty. I shall not volunteer for the task, but perhaps someone in the Treasury who knows nothing about the subject should look at the notes on clauses and decide whether Members of Parliament should be given a little more information. On that semi-jocular point I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Fourth schedule to the Bill.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us the revenue effect of the clause and the schedule combined on the Government's revenue?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that there is no effect. The new arrangements will create a more efficient method of assessing and collecting the tax. If one takes account of present developments and the need to reduce the number of points of control, I understand that there will be no change in the revenue that will flow from that. I am advised that it will be virtually neutral in fiscal terms. Any difference will be slight—no more than a couple of million pounds in a duty of more than £6,000 million, and probably about a million pounds will be in favour of the trade. We seek the cooperation of the trade for those more efficient ways of collecting the duty and it is right that any margin of error should go in that direction.</span></p>
<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister mean £2 million more or £2 million less?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said £2 million in favour of the trade.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That means £2 million less for the Government. I am very grateful to the Minister of State. We shall all want to return to that answer as the subject for a debate as we now have an admission from the Government that £2 million is a slight figure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In £6,000 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Money is money. I shall take my £2 million where I can. If the Government are so free with a couple of million pounds to the oil business, we shall certainly remember that when we go through the Bill and table our new clauses, which will cost a great deal less than £2 million. No less an authority than the Minister of State says that it is a slight figure.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed</i>, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had superbly detailed notes on the clause and schedule but I should like to know more about the impending social law changes in Northern Ireland. At the same time, will the Minister say what the revenue effect of the clause will be? That is a question that we should ask when discussing every clause in the Bill. We have been given no information about the amount of money involved in the notes on clauses, the Red Book or anywhere else. What will be the revenue effect and what social changes are being made?<br><br>
I am not asking for a detailed explanation. I appreciate that the Government have not brought a Minister from the Northern Ireland Office to explain those matters to us but we are happy to have the Minister of State, Treasury, in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The changes under clause 8 and schedule 4 are largely technical. They will leave the practical
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0584">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
duty structure in Great Britain virtually unchanged. Their objective is to extend that structure to Northern Ireland, thus ensuring that gaming machines through-out the United Kingdom are treated in the same way, which, I believe, the Committee will agree is desirable.<br><br>
They will introduce into Northern Ireland the lower rate of duty applicable to "amusement with prizes" machines already in widespread use in the rest of Great Britain in anticipation of changes in the Northern Ire-land social law that will sanction the use of such machines. Those changes are the responsibility of my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. We are taking the precautionary step of ensuring that the same structure of gaming laws will apply throughout the UK on the assumption that my right honourable Friend makes those social changes.<br><br>
I believe that the Committee will agree that the same system should apply in Northern Ireland as in the rest of the UK, and that is our objective. The clause does not introduce the changes in the law for Northern Ireland which would permit the introduction of the gaming machines to which it refers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mt. Fisher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee will agree that the people in Northern Ireland should not be at a disadvantage or treated differently. However, in the absence of a Minister from the Northern Ireland Office, will the Minister of State tell us why the people of Northern Ireland have not been covered by those pro-visions before? Will he tell us, too, whether the clause is in response to representations made to the Treasury from people in Northern Ireland, and, if so, by whom? Perhaps he will enlighten the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that it would be outside the terms of the Finance Bill Committee for me to tread on ground which is the responsibility of my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. We are taking the measure to ensure that the law will apply equally .in all parts of the United Kingdom to taxation on gaming machines. That is without prejudice to what my right honourable Friend the Sec-retary of State for Northern Ireland may or may not do on the issue. I have told the Committee that I understand that it is probable that some changes will be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fisher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will additional staff be required in Northern Ireland to oversee the changes when they come into force?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amount of revenue involved will be very small indeed, assuming that the legalities of the gaming machine regime in Northern Ireland is established in a similar fashion to that which applies elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The extra revenue that may come in is something of the order of £1 million. That is a relatively modest sum when it is set against the revenues from gaming in the United Kingdom as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mt. Fisher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister will agree that to supervise the number of machines and operators which will produce revenue of £1 million will be a considerable task. Will that not mean that more Customs and Excise officers will have to be taken on in Northern Ireland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know but I shall look into the matter. I imagine that probably it will not mean that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
more officers will have to be taken on. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about-it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister for clarification of a point which is related to a matter raised by my hon. Friends? The Minister said, rightly, that it was not the responsibility of the Committee to deal with social laws relating to Northern Ireland and that there-fore we should not go into detail about the matter. Anyone who has experience of the operation of the law relating to gaming machines in this country will know that it would not be an advantage to Northern Ireland to have the same laws. They are much too weak to control the abuses practised by those who run gaming and amusement arcades.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fisher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I accept the term "some". The risks that are inherent to the amusement arcades for some young people are such that I would not want them exported to Northern Ireland.<br><br>
Will the Minister tell me whether this change arises from pressure from within Northern Ireland to change the social laws, or whether the Treasury is moving in advance of any such pressure? Bearing in mind the religious viewpoints in Northern Ireland and judging from my feel of the Province, I am not certain whether there will be wholesale support for the extension of gambling. One fears that the proceeds of gambling will not necessarily go to organisations which the Government might support. I should like to know whether the pressure is from political sources in Northern Ireland or whether the Government feel that they have an opportunity to make another £1 million of taxation by extending gaming machines to Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I gave some of the history of the matter. I understand that for some years, the social law governing all forms of betting and gaming in Northern Ireland has been under review. About a year ago, a consultative document was published, together with a draft Betting, Gaming, Lotteries and Amusements (Northern Ireland) Order, to consolidate and modernise the social law in those areas and to bring it into line with that which applies in the rest of the United Kingdom. The draft order is now being revised to take account of comments received and is expected to be laid before Parliament within the next few months, and to take effect before the end of the year.<br><br>
The proposal would introduce a regime on gaming machines similar to that which already exists in Great Britain. It would give legal sanction to the provision of gaming machines with limited payouts on a variety of premises other than private clubs. When those changes have been made, there will be no reason to retain the separate revenue law, and, specifically, no justification for denying operators in Northern Ireland—in appropriate cases—the benefit of the lower scale of duty rates which will then apply to the rest of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
The purpose is to get equivalence. The changes in social law would be discussed thoroughly in the Province as they came forward, as we would expect on such matters. I understand that the provision will have to come to the House at some point for parliamentary approval.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government will readily admit that if the Opposition were so minded, we could derive great amusement from the clause, I suggest to my hon. Friends that we leave the matter in this context so as to make progress with the Bill. I make only one further comment. I have never heard the phrase "social law". It seems that a new phrase has entered our political vocabulary through the debate.</span></p>
