	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to The Treasury (Mr. John Moore)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Miss Fookes. On Tuesday, I apologised for the apparent late delivery of notes on Government amendments to clauses and schedules debated in that day's sitting and said that I would investigate the matter for the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Investigation into the cause of the delay has been completed: the notes were delivered to the Hall Keeper's Lodge by a Treasury messenger at approximately 1 p.m. on Monday 3 June, and the Lodge staff took them to the letter board. The member of staff there, acting on his own initiative and probably trying to be helpful, arranged for their delivery to the Committee Room where they subsequently awaited the arrival of members of the Committee on the following day. The Chancellor's parliamentary clerk has received a letter of apology from the Assistant Serjeant at Arms. I appreciate that the member of the Lodge staff acted with good intent, but it is right and proper that it is corrected as the notes are beneficial to all members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Hodge Hill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for ensuring that such a thorough and rapid investigation took place. The Opposition accept that there was no malevolent intention, and we are pleased that the Financial Secretary has sorted the matter out so quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is distracting to pass the notes on clauses round in the Committee, as it disturbs hon. Members when envelopes are opened immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in future the Treasury will manage to get documents to us before Committee proceedings begin, but we accept the handsome apology that we have received.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>COVENANTED PAYMENTS TO CHARITY: INCREASE OF EXEMPTION FROM EXCESS TAX LIABILITY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 109, in page 45, line 12, after "companies", insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"in sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 3 (power to apportion amounts deducted in respect of certain annual payments) for the word 'distributable' there shall be substituted the word 'relevant' and".</p></blockquote>
I shall try to combine brevity with doing justice to the weight of argument that lies behind the amendment. The purpose of the amendment is that, by substituting "relevant" for "distributable" in schedule 16 to the Finance Act 1972, trading income of trading companies paid out in charitable donations will not be subject to
	<span class='label label-info column'>368</span>
apportionment. At present, charitable donations paid out by unquoted close companies are thus subject: the argument is simply that they should not be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Individuals and companies that support the amendment point to five strands of argument, and I shall refer to them, rather than develop them in detail, because they will be well known to hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first and essential point is that the existing provisions of apportionment are a deterrent to charitable donations by the shareholders of unquoted companies. That deterrent, self-evidently, is undesirable. Secondly, it follows that by there being a deterrent against charitable donations from one sector, the Treasury is guilty of schizophrenia not least because of the speeches made by the present Foreign Secretary when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1980 about the importance that the Government attached to charitable donations. So we have declarations of acclaim and intent on the one hand and a pocket of tax legislation that works counter to it on the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, and perhaps the major argument in favour of the amendment, is that a fundamental anomaly now exists. The provisions that the amendment seeks to change were drawn up to ensure that no income that could be apportioned was lost to the apportionment mechanics. But since 1980, the trading income of trading companies has not been apportionable, so the anomaly arises of the initial income not being apportionable except in so far as it is donated to charities by unquoted close companies. The argument is that there is no logical reason why, if the original income can no longer be apportioned, charitable donations from it should be thus subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth strand of argument is that the Inland Revenue, and perhaps the Treasury also, has indulged in a fallacious parity argument put forward to justify the present anomaly. It is argued that parity should exist between individuals and the shareholders of close companies. The counter-argument is that there should be parity between close and non-close companies. Charitable donations of non-close companies are not subject to apportionment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, and equally briefly, another argument is put forward by those who support the amendment and wish to see it implemented. No other EEC country or western industrialised country has such provisions, and it is therefore hard to see why the anomaly prevails in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those, in essence, are the arguments for the amendment. I believe that they carry a great deal of weight. I hope that the Chief Secretary will comment on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Corby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: for the reasons so admirably stated by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter), I support the amendment, which stands in my name as well as his.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of hon. Members have been approached by charities which have found that donations made by close companies have been stopped as a result of the Treasury decision to apportion tax upon them. One of the hon. Members involved is my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, South (Mr. Cormack) who has also put his name to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain charities are losing money because of this discrepancy between the treatment of close and of non-close companies. Our amendment seeks to put close
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0727">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>369</span>
companies in the same position as non-close—that is, quoted—companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right honourable and learned Friend the Chief Secretary argues that, notwithstanding the wonderful way in which the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) advanced this argument last week, fiscal neutrality is a continuing theme of tax reform. The hon. Gentleman was suggesting in an attractive and robust way that fiscal neutrality has been abandoned since last year. I like to think that he is wrong. I urge the amendment upon my right honourable and learned Friend because it would achieve fiscal neutrality between close and non-close companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that and for the reasons urged by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke, I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wafts	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Slough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter), which also stands in my name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no justification for treating charitable donations under deed of conenant by a close company differently from those of any other company, unless there is a well-founded fear that such giving under deed of covenant confers some benefit upon the participators in the close company and could therefore be used as a tax avoidance measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If tax avoidance is the fear, and if such a fear is well founded, I suggest to my right honourable and learned Friend that the method used now to prevent the abuse is an extremely blunt instrument and that the possibility of abuse could be dealt with more sharply and directly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if my right honourable and learned Friend feels unable to accept the amendment because of the fears to which I have referred, would he give careful consideration to other possible ways of preventing abuse while not at the same time preventing the beneficial charitable giving by close companies which is restricted by the provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Rees)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I respond to the points so ably and succinctly made by my hon. Friends the Members for Baskingstoke (Mr. Hunter), for Corby (Mr. Powell) and for Slough (Mr. Watts), on the amendment standing in their names and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, South (Mr. Cormack), who does not have the privilege of being a member of this Committee!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in line with Government thinking that charitable donations should be encouraged. Our record in this respect—in income tax, capital gains tax and capital transfer tax — amply demonstrates where our heart lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I deal with the issues that were raised, I am tempted—but I shall reject the temptation—to point out that the amendment is defective. It would not achieve the purpose for which it is intended, because relevant income is arrived at after allowing deduction for annual payments. So to provide, as the amendment seeks to do, an apportionment for amounts deducted in arriving at relevant income would give exactly the same results as at present. In other words, there would be an apportionment of the annual payment. That, I think, is the opposite of what my hon. Friends seek.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal now with the underlying theme. The amendment raises issues of substance which deserve serious treatment. My hon. Friends have invited me
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
to assimilate the treatment of close companies to the treatment of un-close companies. I shall not say "public companies" or "quoted companies", because private, public and quoted companies can themselves be close companies, but I am sure the Committee understands what my hon. Friends propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is more exact to assimilate close companies to a partnership or individuals, that being the treatment that has been accorded. The increase in the limit that we have imposed for individuals for relief on covenanted donations to charity will apply in this case to each individual member shareholder of a close company to whom the covenanted donation by the close company might be apportioned. That person will be able to get relief up to £10,000 a year. So clause 47 will benefit members of close companies, although I agree that it does not go as far as my hon. Friends want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our view, it is fairer to assimilate close companies to partnerships and individuals. That thinking underlies the concept of apportionment, which has been around since 1922 or thereabouts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends may say, "Why not lift it altogether?" That is tempting. But if we did that we should then be told, "But why not lift it altogether for individuals?" At present, we prefer to rest on the undoubted relaxations that we have introduced since 1980. I remind the Committee that we first initiated relief for higher-rate tax for individuals for the first time since the 1940s. I think it was Dr. Dalton who first deprived individual taxpayers for relief from higher-rate tax for covenanted payments to charity. We have gone back to what happened before that time. First, we gave relief to £3,000 per annum, then to £5,000 per annum, and now it is £10,000 per annum. So we can be acquitted of a lack of generosity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends say, "Remove your gaze from the position of individuals, and take it to that of non-close companies." But there is a fundamental difference. A non-close company has a wide spread of shareholders, and its directors would need to satisfy themselves that the donation to charity was appropriate in the circumstances of that company's case. By definition, a close company has a rather close-knit group of shareholders, who might not be over-concerned with what I shall call commercial reasons. They could even set up a company as a vehicle for charitable donations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So for the moment, it is not necessarily the policy of the Government to take the matter further. We feel that considerable relief has been given to individuals, and that clause 47 and its precursors have demonstrated a great appreciation for the position of charities. I realise that my hon. Friends do not entirely accept that we should assimilate the case of close companies to that of the individual shareholders rather than assmilating non-close companies. However, I hope that my hon. Friends will not press the amendment to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comparison with foreign countries can often be misleading. One must know and understand, as I am sure that my hon. Friends do, the provisions of a country's tax legislation. There would be no advantage in adopting that route in the United States or Canada because there the individual would not get relief if he made the payment. Foreign analogies do not necessarily advance the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I understand the intention underlying my hon. Friends' amendment, it is defective. I hope that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0728">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>371</span>
they will feel that the broad increasing measure of relief offered by clause 47, which will apply in the case of close companies, does adequate justice to the cause of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that some relief is afforded to shareholders in unquoted close companies. I accept that the amendment is defective, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr Oonagh McDonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Thurrock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause raises the limit to which an individual person or married couple is entitled to relief at the higher rates of income tax for convenanted payments to charity. The limit goes up from £5,000 to £10,000 for payments made after 5 April 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause applies not only to charities but to three other items which no one would describe as charitable purposes—first, a partnership agreement for full consideration to a former partner or surviving dependant; secondly, in connection with the acquisition of a business by an individual; and, thirdly, in connection with the settlement resulting from divorce or separation. In those three cases, benefit is being raised for relief at the higher rates of income tax. The limit is being doubled this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Chief Secretary tell us the justification for raising the limit? This is the third time that it has been increased. What is the cost of the increase in this financial year and what did the previous alterations cost? We want to know the cumulative cost of the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to raise the notion of charity. I am sure that the Chief Secretary will agree that unfortunately charity is a vague notion in our law. That is a pity. One would like tax changes for charities such as, for example, War on Want, which bring undisputable benefit to those in need abroad or at home. However, one might hesitate to give general support for charities because the words cover private and public schools, including Eton. Opposition Members find it hard to regard Eton as a charity. The term also covers questionable religious sects which many of us are worried about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "charity" is very wide and vague. It is not our purpose to discuss that issue, as it is a general one. If it were given the serious consideration it deserves, we could more happily consider what kind of tax concessions should be made available to charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to draw the Chief Secretary's attention to an article on tax avoidance from the 	<i>Financial Times</i> of 20 August 1983 which refers to tax changes in the 1983 Budget. It shows that the people who would benefit from changes in the clause could make use of the changes in an even more beneficial way to themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know what consideration the Government have given this article as, with the more generous tax reliefs being given in the clause, it does not appear that the Government have taken it into account. The article describes a conference held by the tax avoidance industry which suggests that a rich man might take out covenants in favour of private charities whose beneficiaries were "poor" members of his own family. It states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"A more attractive alternative, however, is to set up a private charity whose object is to help his poor relations, with himself as trustee."</p></blockquote>
Obviously the figures given in this article will be out of date. The amounts given will be higher if the clause is accepted. The article continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If he then covenants to the charity £5,000 a year, he will obtain relief on the gift at his top marginal tax rate. If this is 75 per cent. the cost to him will be only £1,250 per year, with the Inland Revenue effectively paying his relatives the remaining £3,750. The restriction that the recipients should be 'poor' is interpreted fairly liberally."</p></blockquote>
That is one example of how a private charity could be set up and how a man could benefit members of his own family. Those figures are obviously out of date, but the point still holds. He could benefit his family—with the word "poor" interpreted in this liberal fashion—mainly at the expense of the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One of the cheekiest, explained by tax consultant Geoffrey Newman, turns on its head a legal provision introduced by the Inland Revenue which aimed to clamp down on a different tax avoidance scheme. One of the targets of the provision was the case where a father sold to his child—a student paying no income tax—some asset such as a block of shares—and reserved the right to re-purchase it at some future date. His aim would be to ensure that the dividends were taxed at the child's low tax rather than at the father's rate which would be much higher."</p></blockquote>
That scheme has been killed off, but a variation was proposed whereby the father, the higher-rate taxpayer, set up a charity for the purchase of shares. The article states that he was
	<br><blockquote><p>"giving the charity the option to re-purchase it after a specified period. Then, although the taxpayer would be owning the asset and receiving the income, Newman suggested that the same anti-avoidance provision would oblige the Revenue to treat the income as if it were the charity's."</p></blockquote>
It was a rather clever proposal to use an anti-avoidance provision which the Revenue had set up to the benefit of higher-rate taxpayers. The changes proposed in clause 47 would mean that such a tax avoidance device would be even more worth while. Has due care been given to the examination of the use of charities in that way while raising the relief for the high-rate taxpayers? It is important that that should be done. The provision may not cost a great deal; we have yet to hear the figures for the Chief Secretary. However, as he will knows, we feel that quite sufficient money has been made available to high-rate taxpayers in one way or another. Even though the purposes might be described as charitable, unfortunately some people are willing to abuse the notion of charity in order to benefit themselves or members of their family. We await with interest the Chief Secretary's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Yeo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Suffolk, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support the clause briefly. I welcome it very much. I have some sympathy with the point-made by the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) about the vagueness of the definition of charities. Although that is not a matter for the Committee, it is worth noting that the vagueness of that definition is a barrier to extending greater tax concessions to those charities which I am sure both sides of the Committee would wish to support. However, I am not so much concerned by the possible abuses that may result from the increase in the limit as by the fact that its impact on those deserving charities may be rather less than we would hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My wide experience of different sorts of charities suggests to me that the change will bring a limited benefit. I do not wish to appear to be quibbling, but the amount of revenue which the Treasury itself has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0729">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>373</span>
estimated will be lost through the change is extremely small. Indeed, the benefit to charities from this clause is less than the extra cost they will bear in the form of VAT on newspaper advertisements under another clause. For many charities the effect is substantially negative. Although this is not the place to repeat the arguments in favour of giving VAT relief to charities, it is a great pity that, for the second year running, we have a Finance Bill which will result in a reduction of the resources available to individual charities. I am sure that is not what the Government wish to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two points to make about ensuring that the higher limit is exploited to the full. First, the tax return form which individual taxpayers fill in could be redesigned to include a special charity box, similar to the box in which we used to fill in our life assurance premiums. The existence of a such a box would be a useful reminder to all taxpayers of the deduction facility. I am quite confident that this fairly simple change would produce a considerable increase in the number of taxpayers using the covenant system to give money to charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, although this may be outside the scope of the clause, the other obstacle to companies increasing the amount that they give by means of convenants is the requirement that it should be a four year covenant. For individuals, four years seems a perfectly appropriate period because of the realtive predictability and stability of their incomes. But it seems much harder for companies, particularly small ones. If a shorter period were introduced, I have no doubt that a substantially higher amount of corporate profits could be channelled into charities by that method. I have to say, however, that the clause has my strong and entire support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite recognise the areas of relief which the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr McDonald) has identified. I have checked rapidly with section 457 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970, which says plainly that they are convenanted payments to charity. I am advised that that is the only area of relief. I shall look at the matter again, and I shall write to the honourable Lady if I find that I am wrong. As I said, I equipped myself with the Income and Corporation Taxes Act. Subsection (1A), built into section 457 as amended in 1980 and subsequently in 1983, provides that the target area for relief is limited to convenanted donations in favour of charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Thurrock—and, indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo)—pointed out that the definition of charities was a wide one. Its history goes back to the reign of Queen Elizabeth 1, and it has been considered in many cases—such as Pemsel's case—which have exercised the minds of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. The task of trying to redefine "charity" of "charitable" in modern terms has proved very difficult. It has defeated far better brains than mine. Lord Goodman and his Committee pondered the question for many years. The difficulties go much wider than contentious partisan issues such as whether certain schools should be regarded as charitable. I shall listen with great respect if the honourable Lady cares to suggest a tighter and tauter definition of "charity" that will be more easy for the Charity Commissioners and the Inland Revenue to
	<span class='label label-info column'>374</span>
administer. However, I fear that the problem may defeat us again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Lady then drew attention to the possibilities of tax avoidance. I cannot pretend that I have read the article in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> of 20 August 1983. I shall take the opportunity to do so and to discover all the rich possibilities that were opened up on that occasion. However, let me reassure the Committee that the Revenue keeps these matters under close review and that the Charity Commissioners are extremely anxious to ensure that charities fall properly within the definition and that they are properly administered.

The honourable Lady fastened on one particular facet. I understand that it is quite true that charities for the relief of poverty do not have to have the public ingredient that is supposed to colour all other charitable givings. But if the case were too blatant, the settlement would probably not be regarded as charitable. It is not for me to advise the Committee on that because the infinite variety of circumstances would mean that my advice would almost certainly not fit all the cases that cropped up. But I doubt whether a blatant attempt by a father to benefit his son, for example, would be regarded as a proper example of a charitable donation, although the matter would have to be tested in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the outside world will read with interest the hon. Lady's next suggestion, and derive what benefit they can. She talked about the idea of a purchase of shares so that charities could enjoy the benefit of the dividends. It would be rash of me to bless the scheme or to say that it would inevitably fail. That, too, would have to be considered, to see whether such a transaction could properly be regarded as a donation to charity or as a proper settlement—whether there was not some kind of reservation of interest by the settlor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One trespasses on this sensitive legal tax field at one's peril. I shall certainly ask the Revenue to look closely at the hon. Lady's examples but I would not say unhesitatingly that they must succeed. That said, let me reassure the Committee once again that it is the duty of the Charity Commissioners, with the powerful arm of the Attorney General to assist them, to ensure that bodies are properly within the definition and that they are properly administered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South has a long-standing and enviable reputation for work in this field, and we were grateful for his commendation of the extension in the clause. He drew attention to two points. First, he asked whether the tax return form could not contain a specific charitable box. While that suggestion is attractive at first sight, the more that I think about it the more I feel that we would then be under pressure to add a whole range of other boxes. There are, after all, other possible claims for relief, although whether they would necessarily be as meritorious is not for me to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we would eventually find that the exercise was self-defeating, because the tax return form would probably cover an extra five pages and there would be another 154 boxes. The taxpayer filling in the form would be unlikely to feel that he should take special account of such a deduction. While I should like to ponder on my hon. Friend's suggestion, I fear that it would lead to complications rather than to a simplification of the tax return form.

My hon. Friend then asked about the covenanted period, which he limited to companies although it could equally well apply to individuals. My hon. Friend suggested that the period was too long, but—if I may make a technical point—it is not four years but in excess of three years. I should not have thought that three years was too long for most people or bodies corporate to commit themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we first considered reducing the length of time for which a covenant should run, the weight of evidence from many charities suggested that they preferred a longer period because it enabled them to chart their course and make plans with more certainty. I should have thought that a period in excess of three years—which, therefore, need run for only three years and one day—was short enough for present-day purposes. We shall of course review the matter, but I hope that for the moment my hon. Friend will feel, on reflection, that we have not done too badly. The practical consequences for both the donor and the recipient suggest that we should continue to live with the existing period.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to explain the purpose of the amendment, I should like briefly to explain the underlying thinking behind clause 48. Many reputable sources have said to us that the existing provisions for charging a non-resident in the name of his agent in the United Kingdom excludes from the United Kingdom a range of profitable businesses dealing with investment, management
	<span class='label label-info column'>376</span>
of portfolios and so on. The reason is that the non-resident concerned is not prepared to risk a charge to United Kingdom tax on either the income or, in the case of a company, the chargeable gains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On reflection, we do not see why the financial community in the United Kingdom should be prevented from competing fairly with other people who are prepared to offer advice and service across the world. That is the purpose of clause 48. We limited it to those investment transactions, which are not to be subject to scrutiny and charge, and they are defined in subsection (3). One of the definition's transactions is on the Stock Exchange. On reflection, we felt that that was perhaps too narrow a definition as it would have still left within the risk of a charge to tax transactions on the unlisted securities market, the over-the-counter market and overseas stock exchanges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were happy to see that the same thought had occurred to my hon. Friends the Members for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stern) and for Kettering (Mr. Freeman), who tabled an amendment which had the same purpose. I hope that the Committee feel that the clause is unnecessarily restrictive, even though its underlying purpose is limited to transactions on the Stock Exchange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be to our advantage that a range of financial services can be proffered from this country. After all, the fees earned by those who offer those services will, in normal circumstances, be subject to tax in the United Kingdom. I hope that the Committee will feel disposed to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause tries to clarify and alter the circumstances in which a non-resident individual or company is taxed when operating in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency. As I understand it, the effect of the proposed changes is to broaden the exemptions from United Kingdom tax and that the main beneficiaries will be institutions such as banks and other financial service companies which are more likely to be exempt from tax than they were before. How much will that cost, and how much increased business is expected as a result of the tax changes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that a more general review of the taxation on non-residents is due, and so I wonder why the Government have introduced this change now rather than waiting until the review is completed. That review would enable us to consider the whole taxation picture and see which parts needed to be exempt and which did not. If an increase in such business is likely through various financial institutions in the United Kingdom, there would be possible opportunities to raise revenue, and I wonder why the Government have foregone those.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In responding to the hon. Lady's question, I point out that this is not directed at establishing or removing liability, but to a variety of mechanical provisions. Sections 78 and 246 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 enable the Inland Revenue to charge, where there is a liability on the part of a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0731">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>377</span>
non-resident, that liability on the agent in the United Kingdom who is handling the business. Therefore, we are only directing our minds to mechanical provisions and not alterations to any basic liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, it has been found that the existence of these mechanical provisions to charge a United Kingdom agent, in this case one providing financial services, has deterred non-residents from bringing their business to this country. The provisions are purely to allow a flow of business to the country, which must be advantageous not only in the sense that it generates more business bui also, as I emphasised, in that the fees that the United Kingdom agent will charge for such business will in normal circumstances be subject either to income tax if he is an individual or one of a partnership, or to corporation tax if he is a company. Our estimate is that the cost to the revenue will be negligible and there will be no staff costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked, "How much business?" and I would like to be able to tell her, but I cannot because that will depend on how attractive the United Kingdom, as a financial centre, appears to those who want to channel their investment business through this country. I hope that we will be able to tell in some years time, but it would be rash of me to give speculative figures and I shall not trouble the Committee with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady remarked perfectly accurately that an internal review was taking place on the taxation of nonresidents. She asked why we could not wait to see the whole picture in the round. As I have said, the clause is not designed to relieve or increase a particular liability; it relates only to mechanical provisions. The problem can be easily and closely defined. We saw no virtue in waiting and treating it as part of a general review. We thought that it could be detached and treated on its own, bearing in mind that at the end of the day it should be of general benefit to the country. It is on that basis that I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the excellent notes on clauses which we have referred to so often, we understand that this is blocking a potential loophole. I would be grateful if, for the sake of the record, the Minister would explain that to us. I do not ask him to go into too much detail—it sounds to me like the least said the soonest mended because I do not think that anyone has taken advantage of this loophole because of the use of the adjective "potential". Nevertheless, will the Minister explain it to us in broad terms?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly reasonable and legitimate request, especially as the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>378</span>
The hon. Gentleman will recall that he particularly dealt with the tax charge on UK residents on the proceeds of any offshore life assurance policy they held. The defect would have enabled avoidance of the charge by placing an offshore life policy in a non-resident trust. The measure we have proposed will block what potential loophole. That is the essence of the potential loophole and it is right to block it because it was not the intention in last year's legislation, which was to try to protect the rights of expatriated while blocking residents from having a tax advantage when we closed the loophole on offshore roll-up funds. I can, of course, go into considerably more detail if the hon. Gentleman should so wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman sits down, will he tell us how the loophole came to his notice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It came to my notice through the diligent work of my Inland Revenue officials. It would have been inappropriate for me to ask in particular, but I gather that inquiries were made into the possibility of pursuing that line of business, which immediately alerted my intelligent officials to the fact that there may be a loophole in the legislation, which they immediately sought to stop. That is how the Inland Revenue discovered it. Perhaps the inquiry should not have been made, but it was, and I imagine that the hon. Gentleman is delighted that we have sought to block a potential loophole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not wish to discourage the poachers from asking permission from the gamekeeper. It sounds as if that is what happened on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We spent some time dealing with this aspect of tax legislation a year ago, and I seem to recall receiving assurances that the legislation was watertight. Clause 49 is the fourth clause in the Bill which deals with mistakes which the Treasury made a year ago. My hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) tells me that there are more. My count is only four to date. We have had the Cinzano or Joan Collins clause, a defect in the composite rate scheme for bank interest, the matter of deep discount securities and now offshore life assurance. I have sought and received time after time willing assurances that matters have been dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to discourage the people who have spotted potential loopholes and drawn them to the attention of the Inland Revenue so that they may be quickly blocked, nor the quickwitted Treasury or Inland Revenue officials for compounding their mistakes, or—perhaps more likely—the mistakes of other people in their Departments. However, I wish to put on record that we seem to be blocking many of the loopholes which were created by the legislation of last year. Not all of them are as forgivable as perhaps this one is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

his request and tell the Committee that the clause provides that LRT tax losses which are the counterpart to previously exempt grant income should be disregarded for the purpose of calculating future liability to corporation tax. It is exactly parallel with the other clauses in the Transport Bill. It is a straightforward technical clause. The Transport Bill did not encompass the London area, so we have to try to deal with it in the Finance Bill. I shall go into more detail if the Committee wishes, but that is the essence of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Financial Secretary will go into a little more detail. We obviously do not want to start debating the Transport Bill, and you would not wish us to stray that far out of order, Miss Fookes. What provision will be made, and will it be lost as a result of the enactment of the Transport Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, what will the tax effect of the clause be? If the clause is agreed to, will revenue be greater than it would be otherwise, or will it cost the Treasury money? Perhaps the Financial Secretary will explain. I have more experience as a former bus conductor than of these matters. I only took the pennies and shillings on the bus. I want to know what will happen to passengers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can explain the position. The transport executives, whether they are in London or elsewhere in the country, received grant aid from the local authorities. Unlike nationalised industries, their grant aid did not have liability for corporation tax and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a transport authority had a loss of £100 million and a grant income of £80 million in one year, it would declare not a net loss of £20 million, as in a nationalised industry, but a carry-forward loss of £100 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would ignore the grant income. That was because of the transport authorities' relationship to local authorities. That anomaly was removed for transport executives except the London Transport Executive in clause 105 of the Transport Bill. It covered all transport authorities other than London's which could not have been covered in that legislation. We decided that those theoretical losses could not be carried forward into the new areas of business of the new entities. It therefore has no impact, but, theroetically, it would have given a notional loss that was not merited because there was no tax liability in the previous arrangement for grant. They are now on the same parallel basis as nationalised and other entities. The question of whether or not they receive grant or subsidies does not change. The issue is the theoretical tax ability. I hope that that explanation helps hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do so as best I can. The interrelationship of the different parts of oil taxation is incredibly complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 51 is directed at what might be described as a technical lacuna in the present corporation and income tax rules for valuing oil which came to light during our recent consideration of the PRT treatment of what are called extended production tests. That consideration led to the provisions in clauses 84 and 85. I shall give the Committee a detailed explanation of the problems surrounding extended production tests and how we propose to solve them when we come to that part of the Bill. But although closely connected to the PRT clauses, Finance Bill conventions, as all hon. Members present know, dictate that remedying the technical lacuna in the CT and income tax rules has to be by means of a separate clause in the part of the Bill now under discussion. To help the Committee understand how the clause fits into the scheme of things, it might be useful if I outline briefly how oil valuation rules work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where United Kingdom oil is sold at arm's length, the producer is charged to CT and income tax on the actual sales proceeds. Only where United Kingdom oil is not disposed of at arm's length does its market value need to be determined for tax purposes. In the normal course of events, the market value determined for PRT purposes is used for CT and income tax. There can, however, be circumstances, the most obvious being the extended production tests, where oil which has not already been value for PRT needs to be valued for CT or income tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provisions exist for valuing oil in these circumstances if it is disposed of by the producing company to, say, an affiliate. At present, the provisions do not cover oil that is appropriated by the producing company itself—for example, for use in refining. Clause 51 closes that unintended technical lacuna in the provisions to enable such appropriated oil to be valued on the normal market value basis for CT or income tax. Essentially, we found a gap in the actual coverage of potential CT and PRT when we re-examined the whole of PRT, which we will come to on clause 84 and those following it. It would not be appropriate to go into extended production tests now, but there is potential for revenue loss. Clearly, it was right that CT be paid in those areas if a company was not selling on oil or putting it on to an affiliate but using it internally—for refining, for example. Clause 51 will block the lacuna and ensure that CT is liable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for defining "lacuna". I understood it to mean gap" but that is just a short word for "loophole", or so it seems. Which word are we discussing? Is there a great deal of that oil or just a small amount? I should have thought that most oil extracted from the North sea would be refined in this country, although much will be exported. Are we talking about most of the oil extracted by a company? The Financial Secretary to

	<span class='label label-info column'>381</span>
the Treasury shakes his head, so we must be talking about a small amount. Perhaps he will explain more fully just what oil we are talking about. I should have thought that it would all go from the North sea into a refinery. The Minister mentioned extended production tests and perhaps he will clarify that term. Has any money been lost in the past as a result, and is the loophole real or only potential?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a feature of the pattern of progressive development in the North sea and the way in which extended production tests are developing that in some cases they can produce amounts of oil which penetrate the level at which there is a CT liability. I shall give some idea of the potential amounts to show that it could be—it has not been so far a potential loss of revenue. For example, under an extended production test, a conventional single well test could produce 10,000 barrels of oil a day for 90 days with a total value at current prices approaching £20 million. On that basis, there could be a potential loss. Clearly, we should ensure that the gap is covered in the absence of a CT provision for oil not sold on or given to an affiliate but used for internal refining. It is a small potential area but it could produce some significant revenue because of the amounts involved in the oil industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Chapter II of the Bill concerns capital allowances. We are debating the clauses because of the legislative foolhardiness of abandoning capital allowances in the Budget last year. Instead of a series of penitential amendments, this year we have a series of consequential amendments on the original error. Having studied the report of the debate last year on capital allowances, I find it particularly surprising that the Government have not changed their mind because the arguments last year were won conclusively by the Opposition. Conservative Members should read the report of the debates because they may have drifted off when they were taking place. That may be the reason why their voting record was not all that it should have been. It is even worse now because it is one thing to deal with consequential amendments if they are readily understood but I do not lay any blame on the draftsmen—these passages are among the most complex that Parliament has had to deal with for a considerable time. My grievance is all the stronger because I have had to understand them in order to debate them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 52 sets a revision in the basic code for capital allowances. I understand that, before the 1984 Budget,
	<span class='label label-info column'>382</span>
when a first-year allowance was granted, that allowance was able to be claimed on the purchase of the machinery and it was not necessary to claim the first-year allowance when the machinery was brought into use. However, the writing-down allowances which, in most cases, occurred after the first-year allowance, if all of that allowance was not taken, were able to be claimed only when the piece of plant or machinery was brought into use. As, after the transitional period has passed, the first-year allowance is now abolished and—sensibly— writing-down allowances may be claimed, the rules have been changed so that writing-down allowances may be claimed when the machinery or plant is bought rather than when brought into use. So I find it easy to understand the purpose of the Government's thinking on clause 52(2). However, amendment No. 191 seeks to delete subsection (1), which would add the words "whollly or exclusively" before the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of trade"</p></blockquote>
when deeming whether capital allowance may be claimed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to probe the Government's purpose in introducing those words into the statute. It is difficult to understand why the Government have done so because the words "wholly and exclusively" are not necessary as a result of anything that happened last year. In other words, they have nothing to do with first-year allowances being taken away and the substitution or writing-down allowances. Therefore, one assumes that it has been done independently of the Budget changes of last year. It has caused concern for two reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is provision in paragraph 5 of schedule 8 to the Finance Act 1971 for the claiming of allowances when plant or machinery is used partly for trade purposes and partly for other purposes. Has the relationship been changed between clause 52 and writing-down allowances and schedule 8 to the Finance Act 1971? Are the words "wholly and exclusively" supposed in any way to be a caveat or qualification on the way that paragraph 5 of schedule 8 operates? One assumes not, but confirmation of that point would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in 1953, there was a tax case known as G. H. Chambers and Northern Farmers Ltd. v. Watmough. It concerned a man who, I believe, was the owner of a fruit farm—I do not think that it was a limited company—and the taxpayer in question had bought a Bentley car rather than a Humber car. Not surprisingly, the commissioners found that his personal choice in preferring Bentley cars to Humber cars entered into his decision to buy one. Therefore, the particular purchase was not solely for the purposes of trade but involved an element of personal choice. Is the purpose of the addition of the words "wholly and exclusively" related in any way to that case, or to the fact that some elements of personal choice may enter into the purchase of plant and machinery?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should know the answer to that question because we should be clear about the purposes of the clauses of the Bill. One danger of their complexity is that, under the guise of merely making consequential amendments to last year's Budget decision, wrong though that may have been, we may allow, perhaps unintentionally, matters to be put into this year's Finance Bill that will have a dramatic impact on the way in which companies operate. In particular, as the Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0734">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>383</span>
is complex, we need to be quite sure about the Government's intentions so that we may explain to our constituents and others the exact purpose of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have grouped a number of questions to the Minister around amendment No. 191 and I shall be grateful if he will answer them.

Amendments Nos. 192 and 193 relate to paragrpah 1 of schedule 11 which, in turn, concerns section 46 of the Finance Act 1971 that deals with machinery and plant on lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an aside, I mention that a problem with this legislation is that each time one attempts to understand a particular clause in the Bill, so many cross-references are required that it is necessary to have an armful of books and to scurry from one to another to see how matters relate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 46 of the Finance Act 1971 covers machinery and plant on lease. It provides that, when machinery is leased other than in the course of trade, capital expenditure is treated for the purposes of a quite separate trade. Paragraph 1 of schedule 11 to this Bill ensures that the phrase "wholly and exclusively" refers to section 46 of the 1971 Act. That gives a certain symmetry, as the phrase also appears in clause 52.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am puzzled about why "wholly and exclusively" should be conjoined in schedule 11 by the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or only partly for the purposes of the trade".</p></blockquote>
I thought that the essence of the changes being made was to ensure that there would be no capital allowance when there was only partly a trade purpose, save for schedule aid. I am sure that the Financial Secretary is eager to dispel any illusions among Labour Members about the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) would not expect me to accept his analysis of the 1984 capital allowances. I shall send him a copy of the 1982 Labour party programme relating to CT, which closely follows the proposals that we enacted in 1984—but of course I am not suggesting for a moment that we should always follow Labour party programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman's remark that the consequence of our decision last year has been great complexity in this Bill. I commend the hon. Gentleman. Clearly, he has a complete grasp of the terrifying inter-relationships in capital allowance law. Essentially, clause 52 is a relieving measure, but it has led to considerable concern among some people. I shall try to dispel the fears that have been expressed in that respect. This is one of the most important elements of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove clause 52(1), the object of which is to insert the words "wholly and exclusively" into provisions of the capital allowances code for machinery and plant relating to first-year and writing-down allowances. Last year, for reasons that we discussed fully, CT rates were cut substantially, and 100 per cent first-year allowances for machinery and plant were abolished over a three-year period. When the new scheme fully comes into effect next year, depreciation will be recognised by 25 per cent writing-down allowances on a reducing balance basis. But the difference between first-year and writing-down allowances is not only that the former were at 100 per cent. so
	<span class='label label-info column'>384</span>
providing a substantial investment incentive, while the latter are at 25 per cent. broadly matching depreciation. There is also a substantial number of other differences in the detailed rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, first-year allowances are due when the expenditure on an asset is incurred—that is something which we shall be discussing on clause 53—but writing down allowances are not due until the asset is brought into use for the purposes of the taxpayer's trade. In most instances an asset will be brought into use at about the same time as the expenditure is incurred, so there will be no effective difference between the two dates. However, in some cases—for example, an asset such as a ship, which takes a long time to build, with the consequence that stage payments are common practice at least some of the expenditure may be incurred several years before the asset is brought into use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons which led us to remove the incentive element in the allowances did not also mean that we should postpone the time when allowances were due. Hence, we announced that we would remove in this year's Finance Bill the condition for the allowance that the asset was used for the purposes of the trade. Clause 52 and schedule 11 give this effect. The ability to claim writing-down allowances at an earlier stage than might otherwise have been possible under the rules as they have existed hitherto will be of valuable assistance in those cases where there is a considerable time lag before use for the trade begins and stage payments are made as manufacture proceeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, before the clause removes the brought into use requirement, subsection (1) deals with a preliminary point. One of the other conditions for writing-down allowances, which is being retained, s that the capital expenditure should be incurred for the purposes of the trade. The addition of the words "wholly and exclusively" flows from the abolition of the use condition. The new rule will require explicitly that the capital expenditure was incurred "wholly and exclusively" for the purposes of the trade instead of, as now, simply for
	<br><blockquote><p>"the purposes of the trade".</p></blockquote>
The words are being introduced so that in the absence of a use test it will be possible to distinguish clearly expenditure on an asset bought partly for trade and partly for other, possibly private, purposes. That will enable allowances to be adjusted on a just and reasonable basis, as they are now to reflect the element of non-trade use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not the least intention to deprive anyone of an allowance in circumstances where he would have been entitled to an allowance under the old rules. I am grateful for the opportunity to put that on record. I understand that the words to be inserted have long been used as an implicit test of expenditure qualifying for capital allowances. Assets bought wholly for trade purposes will, as now, quality for allowances without restriction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sedgefield asked whether paragraph 5 conflicted in any way with the Finance Act 1971. The answer is that the relationship has not changed. He also asked about the Chambers case. Again, the position is unchanged. I could go into more detail and elaborate the point on the Bentley and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0735">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>385</span>
the Daimler choice, but he knows the point that I am making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I go on to discuss amendments, which are slightly consequential, I hope that, the hon. Gentleman will accept the assurance that the words "wholly and exclusively" are not intended to be restrictive so as to deprive anyone of an allowance to which he would otherwise have been entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to develop his argument on amendments Nos. 192 and 193, which are connected in a consequential fashion. Section 46 of the Finance Act 1971 enables capital allowances to be claimed in respect of expenditure on machinery or plant that is let, or where the letting does not amount to the carrying on of the trade by the lessor. In those circumstances section 46 treats the expenditure on the machinery or plant as having been incurred for the purposes of a trade so that the usual capital allowance rules for plant are brought into play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One rule is in paragraph 5 of schedule 8 to the Finance Act 1971, which provides for adjustments to the allowances where plant and so on is used partly for trade purposes and partly for other purposes. Where that is the case, the allowances are reduced on a just and reasonable basis according to the merits of the case. The abolition of the use requirement which clause 52 brings about and the introduction of the words "wholly and exclusively" have several technical consequences, which are contained in parts I and II of schedule 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the technical consequences is the necessary addition to section 46 of the Finance Act 1971 to ensure that where machinery or plant is provided partly for the purposes of the letting and partly for other purposes the provision of paragraph 5 of schedule 8, which itself is to be amended by schedule 11 to the 1985 Finance Bill, continue to operate in much the same way as they do now. That is the purpose of paragraph 1 of schedule 11. If we accepted the amendments, at best the position would be unclear and at worst not achieve that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that this subject is extraordinarily complex. I commend the hon. Member for Sedgefield, who does not have the benefit of my excellent officials, for introducing his amendments so lucidly. I hope that my assurance will be sufficient to persuade him not to press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his assurance. I understand from him that the words "wholly and exclusively" do not alter the capacity, ability or entitlement of people to claim capital allowances. That being so, I am happy to accept the Minister's assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now understand the point that the Minister makes on schedule 11. The difficulty arose because the additional words
	<br><blockquote><p>"wholly and exclusively or only partly"</p></blockquote>
in section 46 of the 1971 Finance Act did not appear in subsection (1) of that section. They appeared for the first time in schedule 11, and that may have caused some difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has given us a clear assurance and so I need not press my amendment. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>386</span>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed, </i>That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to address some questions to the Financial Secretary, and clause 52 represents the best place to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already spoken about the changes made to capital allowances last year. Many hon. Members know that companies have been worried that their investment it programmes have been interrupted by the changes in capital allowances. Many companies have found that programmes that they had started have had to be entirely changed because they can no longer claim the allowances they had previously claimed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two clear questions for the Financial Secretary. First, have figures for capital investment this year been greatly distorted by companies bringing forward their capital investment so that it could be carried out before the changes come into effect? If we are right in believing that such a distortion has occurred, how can it be said that companies did not require the capital investment? Secondly, can the Treasury give any estimate of the total effect of abolishing capital allowances since last year's Budget? We know only of the circumstances of individual companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not surprising that I find it necessary to put these questions to the Financial Secretary. Investment, particularly in British manufacturing industry, has been extremely poor since 1979. The abolition of exchange controls has sent money abroad and it is extremely important that as much as possible should be done to assist companies wishing to invest in, and build up, our industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Financial Secretary will not feel it wrong that we should be asking these questions now. They deserve answers and the clause-stand-part debate on clause 52 seems the best time to seek them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stuart Randall	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston upon Hull, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 52 is an important clause. I know from correspondence I received when capital allowances were abolished last year that many companies were worried. Although the Government responded by proposing certain changes for high-tech companies, the events of last year caused great traumas in that section of industry. The companies needed to make investments and to write them off over a short period. The asset was ephemeral; it was there for perhaps three years because the product had a high rate of obsolesence. The result of technological change was that companies could obtain productivity improvements by writing something off very quickly and having other products to provide considerable savings. This meant that there was always an incentive to industry to change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous arrangement for capital allowances provided the incentive. When the Chancellor of the Exchequer made his statement in March 1984, the reaction of industry was considerable. We all realise that manufacturing industry is crucial to Britain; that is where wealth is produced. The money for all the social programmes that we are constantly under pressure to support—nurses' pay, for instance—comes from industry, and in that respect capital allowances are very relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a Socialist, I feel particularly strongly on the issue. Conservative Members do not care so much about social programmes; they go for high profits, creaming
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0736">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>387</span>
off, and all the other things that we hear so much about. But for Opposition Members—the caring side of Parliament—it is a matter of great importance, and the removal of the allowances came as a great shock to us. Mine is a deprived constituency. Industries there were having to diversify and new businesses were being established because of the decline of the fishing industry. That, of course, was directly affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was very worried last year about the effect of the abolition of capital allowances and the introduction of the writing down of assets—the WDA, as it is called. It had a serious effect on industry's investment policy. There must have been many companies which had analysed their investment programmes and done their cash flow sums, and for them a 100 per cent tax allowance in the first year was very important. For that to be reduced, particularly in the case of companies embarking on a substantial growth and investment programme, was indeed a serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That corresponds, of course, with the Government's appalling treatment of British industry. It was yet another kick in the teeth for British industry. Small businesses were being established, partly because of high unemployment—for instance, when British Steel closed its major plants. That was the pattern for a number of years. Then the Government's big boot comes in and causes great destruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must do what we can to support British industry. I personally am prepared to pay more income tax to regenerate British industry. We must get the climate right so that British industry will begin to expand. That is crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the "wholly and exclusively" issue, which the Minister explained very clearly, and pleased by his statement that the provision would not be restrictive. If it were, companies that would otherwise be entitled to tax allowances might not get them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found the question of non-trade use extremely complicated. The Minister did his level best to explain it but he gave us a great deal of detail in a short time and I did not quite understand it. As a simple Socialist reading the Bill in the context of my own dear people, I believe that anything involving non-trade use is to be questioned. By accepting non-trade use we open a loophole for abuse such as tax benefits for personal use of company property. I did not understand fully the definition of the use test because we were not given specific examples. However, I do not want to take up the Committee's time on the issue because my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) covered most of the points I wished to raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand clause 52, capital allowances are provided for periods ending after 31 March 1985. Writing down allowances for plant and equipment, but not for services, may be claimed by reference to the date when expenditure is incurred rather than when the asset is brought into use. Apart from the Minister's example of a ship, he said that it was expected that the two dates would roughly correspond. I believe that that was the idea when last year's legislation was drafted. I can think of many examples where the dates when expenditure is incurred and when the asset is brought into use correspond but I am sure that there must be many instances where they do not. In the clock business of
	<span class='label label-info column'>388</span>
my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) I am sure that the dates would correspond. With the Taiwan shipyard, or other large shipyards with long lead times, the dates would not correspond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that for the chargeable periods ending 31 March 1985, first-year allowances will not be withdrawn if plant is disposed of without being brought into use and that writing down allowances will not be withheld if plant has not been used for the purposes of the trade. To make sure that my understanding is correct, will the Minister confirm that the first-year allowance will not be withdrawn under those conditions of disposal of machinery?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crucial that we have an incentive for investment for we must regenerate British industry. The action of the Chancellor of the Exchequer last year was a disaster. We all shuddered when we saw the pattern of the decline of British industry, which involved closures and a considerable effect on unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome certain parts of the Government's proposals and it is good to see the Government realising the error of their ways. I was a member of the Committee which considered last year's Finance Bill. The Opposition produced a strong case and won the arguments but the Government's huge majority saw them through. I am glad that they have seen the error of their ways and have assured us that, in relation to trade use, subsection (1) will not be restrictive and that companies will be able to proceed and get their allowances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take up the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) and ask the Minister to comment on certain aspects of the results of last year's decisions as they affect the clause. Several points concern us all. There is a spatial dimension to decisions that have been made, which affects some regions in a different way from for example, the south-east. The accusation has often been made that the government of the south-east tends not to reflect the impact of legislation on northern industry. It is predominantly manufacturing industry which depends, for example, on capital allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manufacturing industry has been concerned about the changes which the Government propose because it was announced and because it affects investment plans. My hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield made a worthwhile point in questioning the impact of this sudden and relatively unannounced decision upon the structure of investment decisions. It will cause problems for those who are involved in manufacturing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An area such as Trafford Park in my own constituency depends on its massive manufacturing base. A problem with the proposed change is that it encourages investment to replace that which is necessary to maintain an ongoing business but discourages investment in new projects which we should like to encourage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the Minister has any figures to prove whether my assertion is right or wrong. In effect we are shoring up an industrial structure, which is inappropriate, and not advancing the infrastructure which should be developed. That is of particular concern to regions such as the north-west and the north and Scotland and Wales, which depend on investment by the manufacturing sector for the future. Investment in maintenance is not enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0737">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>389</span>
Another cause for concern is that the proposed change will have an impact in terms of different tax purposes. It is recognised that it will have an adverse effect on capital intensive firms. I would not want to defend capital allowances for industries such as the oil industry, which over the years has done extremely well because of regional incentives and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are inevitably many industries which, while not being capital intensive to anything like the degree of the oil industry, nevertheless depend critically on the capital that they use. That is true of large slices of the engineering industry. The engineering industry depends upon its capital investment. A change such as this makes a vast difference to the future success or failure of a firm which in the economic sense is marginal. Is there any information about the impact upon investment in those industries which have been particularly vulnerable throughout the period of the recession? In a nutshell, what will be the impact of the decision on the different industrial sectors?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I have a more general point about writing-down allowances as opposed to 100 per cent allowances. Ironically, I would have expected it to be more ideologically satisfactory for the Government to maintain the system as it was. In many ways, the 100 per cent allowance is consistent with the views held elsewhere. I believe for a number of reasons that the 100 per cent allowance is more satisfactory. It is one of the few ways of recognising—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—As my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) points out, it is like a grant in reverse. Expenditure defrayed in any one year is a cost absolution for that business. I recognise the classic accounting argument, that spreading the tax allowance over a number of years reflects the fact that the asset has a productive value over a course of years. However, that expenditure takes place at a discrete point in time. In many ways it is far more satisfactory to have it recognised in the taxation system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More importantly, in a period of inflation the difficulty of writing down an allowance is that it never in practice achieves the effect of allowing the total claimed by a company for the expenditure that it incurred in the first place. Therefore, at a time of recession and marginality in industry, it is important to encourage the investment process. These measures have been to discourage that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a few words about the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) particularly about 100 per cent allowances. They are, in effect, grants. If it were possible to regionalise that principle, it would gain the support of many of my hon. Friends. The problem within tax law as I understand it is how to regionalise it. I have persisted over the years in asking Ministers how that would be possible. It would be good if one day a Minister said how it could be done and if an exercise could be carried out. We might then be able to rejig our whole regional incentive apparatus using the tax system. In many ways that may be a far more efficient way of instituting a sensible regional policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to draw attention to some inconsistencies. I have before me a press release from our friends in the Inland Revenue dated 19 March. It refers to capital allowances. Page 1 reads:
	<span class='label label-info column'>390</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"This programme on capital allowances carries forward the reform of business taxation which the Chancellor launched last year. The programme aims to encourage enterprise, efficiency and employment through reductions in the rates of tax and company profits and rephasing capital allowances. This would encourage investment which is truly worth doing and productive so that industry as a whole can improve its profitability and expand at the same time. Investment which is worth while only because of the tax incentives will be discouraged."</p></blockquote>
We have all heard such phrases a million times over in the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder how that fits in with a document that I received from my old friends at the Confederation of British Industry, entitled "Make it Work". It is dated January 1985 and was probably written about the same time as the press release. We all know of the special relationship between the CBI and the Chancellor, yet they seem to have drawn very different conclusions on this occasion. The Inland Revenue press release says how wonderful things are, while the CBI refers in its graph to "the dip". That dip identifies precisely the years that the press release refers to as years of expansion, development and investment. The CBI document says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the 25 per cent reducing balance system will lead to a sharp dip in the reliefs available for investment in machinery and plant."</p></blockquote>
Chart 2 shows the total allowance due as a percentage of annual investment in 1986 and 1987, and the dip is there for all the members of the Committee to see. It refers to the very years that the press notice said would be good years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am just a simple lad. I just want to know how the Inland Revenue can talk so positively about that period, while our good friends and comrades in the CBI refer to "a dip". We are grateful for the information that the CBI sends us. The only CBI release that we ignore is the one that comes out just before the general election, which does not reflect the real position: we know that in its heart of hearts the confederation supports the Tories. But after elections, our confidence is restored, and my confidence is thoroughly restored by this document because it sets out to tell me the truth. The Minister should address himself specifically to its contents in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He might also refer to another document. I see that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) is not with us today. I think that he has something to do with the Institute of Chartered Accountants—as do a number of his hon. Friends. The institute has sent us a document called TR580 dealing with the Finance Bill 1985, which asks a number of eminently sensible questions about the clause and its operations. In case those questions have not been answered fully, I shall go through them so that my hon. Friends can pursue the Minister if he seeks to duck the question in the same way as the Prime Minister sought to duck questions on the social security review at the Dispatch Box today. The chartered accountants' document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many of our members have expressed concern as to the reasons for the introduction of these changes"</p></blockquote>—
that refers to the revised code.
	<br><blockquote><p>"It has been suggested that the clause is a minor drafting amendment, but we consider that it could operate very widely."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Minister would care to comment en the width of the operation of the clause.—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The document continues:

The Minister may care to comment on that, too.
	<br><blockquote><p>"We wish to ensure that these provisions are not designed to extend the position regarding disallowance of capital allowances along the lines of the decision of G. H. Chambers (Northern Farms) Limited v. Watmough.

My hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) has already raised the matter; I rise merely to reinforce the case that he put. All those questions need answering, and I am sure that the Minister will be eager to answer them when he replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to respond, especially after the invitation of the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), who clearly endorsed his hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield's thorough analysis of the Chambers case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a good opportunity to consider the implications of the major changes that the Government introduced last year. The hon. Member for Sedgefield was right to say that a stand-part debate will be helpful. First, I shall briefly remind the Committee of some of the factors surrounding our desire to change the corporation tax system so radically. I shall try in the process to respond to what hon. Members have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start by reassuring the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall). When he asked a specific and detailed question I nodded. I think it as well to have that on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to written texts by the Labour party, the old system was not particularly acceptable. There was, theoretically, a nominal corporation tax rate of 52 per cent. a small companies rate of 38 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And stock relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that stock relief is relevant to the overall debate, but we are discussing corporation tax at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a small companies rate of 38 per cent which was surrounded by anomalies, quite apart from the faults implicit in the system. It is thought by many in all parts of the political spectrum that that did not benefit our country's long-term growth and development. Only one third of companies regularly paid corporation tax; another third never paid it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1983-84, when we were examining the fundamentals of the system, the revenue yield was only about £4 billion. We saw an odd contrast between a theoretical nominal set of high rates which discouraged people
	<span class='label label-info column'>392</span>
from going into business and generating jobs, and the reality of which all those involved in the system were aware—a battery of reliefs, fundamental to which were first-year or initial allowances, which meant, for whatever reason, that the revenues involved were quite modest. That was very different from the system in most of our competitor nations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system had several basic faults. First, it encouraged investment whether that investment was profitable or not. Many looked only at the post-tax rates of return, not at the pre-tax rates. I shall say more about the consequences in a moment, but the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) rightly asked about the results of what we now propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly—I am not in any way decrying the role of accountants or lawyers, being neither myself—many companies pursued tax efficiency rather than truly profitable investment. These were historical allowances arrangements that we had all grown into. They encouraged the replacement of labour by machinery even when, as in many instances, there was no economic case for doing so. But the very legitimate question asked by the hon. Member for Stretford concerned the replacement of machinery by machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West said that it was crucial to have an incentive for investment. The hon. Gentleman should remember the results of the past process. Two things could be anticipated with what was clearly a massive incentive system. One would hope in the first instance that it produced more investment; that seemed to be what he said. I am not talking about regional quantity, but greater quantity for the United Kingdom. With the most generous investment in the western world, it did not increase. The data is clear. The data was published in a more detailed analysis entitled "Economic Progress Report" of May 1984, but I shall not weary the Committee with that now. The report did not use figures from one party's period of office, but figures from throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s. It used the figures overall of United Kingdom gross investment as a proportion of GDP and as a relative comparison with the other OECD nations and it showed that we were not much below or above but that we were somewhere solidly in the middle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first theoretical aim of incentives was to increase the quantum. It did not. It did not particularly deter or encourage. It gave us no greater average than comparative countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second key point was the quality of investments and whether the incentives produced a better quality of plant and the kind of replacement point, to which the hon. Member for Stretford referred. I accept that it is difficult to analyse comparative international data, but all the relevant data showed that we were worse than our comparative OECD countries in that respect. I accept that there were other reasons for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister explaining this matter at length, but any businessman will not invest unless there is a demand for his product. Of course we wish to create incentive for investment, but it must be seen within the broader context of the overall demand in the economy. That is why in the past we have not necessarily had the rate of investment when we have provided the incentive. That was due to the general state of the economy. That is what I was thinking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. I shall not go into the particular details to illustrate to the hon. Gentleman that in the last five to six years the average rate of demand growth a year has been greater, even taking the period to 1979, than in the similar period of Labour Government. However, I am not trying to make political points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the period between 1976 and 1980, the pre-tax rate of return here in manufacturing was 6 per cent. in West Germany it was 16 per cent. in the United States, 18 per cent and in Canada 18 per cent. Those figures reflected the quality of return as well as quantity, and that prompted many of us to wonder whether the system was right. I gather that not only were the Conservative Government concerned. The Labour party in 1982 said that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tell us what the Alliance party said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I prefer to deal with Her Majesty's official Opposition. Although I never expect to see it, the official Opposition have a theoretical prospect of office as opposed to the other vague aspect of something called an alliance, which does not begin to address such matters seriously. The Labour party has put its views on paper, so we know clearly where it stands. The Labour party said in 1982 that:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"We must have a corporation tax system with lower percentage rates of tax than in the past but with more restricted reliefs and allowances. We must be less prone to manipulation that can reduce taxable profit below any fair assessment of profitability."</p></blockquote>
I could not agree more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the essence of a similar set of views that led to this radical change. The hon. Member for Sedgefield went on to ask, "what is the product so far?". Obviously it is early days but I remind him of the pattern of investment, for example, as well as the point he made on the gap. The private non-oil—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oil.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—non-oil, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) legitimately sotto voce occasionally says, "oil". Non-oil private business was up 10 per cent in 1984 to record levels. It was extremely difficult to contemplate that the Government's proposals in the spring of 1984 would see a total radical change to record levels. The FSBR Red Book forecasts suggest a further 9 per cent growth in 1985, continuing into 1986.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of Trade and Industry's latest investment intention survey published last December suggests an 8 per cent growth in private business investment and about 7 per cent in manufacturing. The hon. Member for Sedgefield legitimately asked if all of that was for storing. Clearly, there will be some for storing.
	<span class='label label-info column'>394</span>
There must be in a transitional period when we are phasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We always expected that some investment would be brought forward into 1984 and 1985 to get the relative benefit of transitional provisions. That has been taken into account in our forecasts. There are clear indications that this has happened. There has been a strong increase in leasing business, as was widely expected. However, there is no general expectation of a significant downturn after 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the CBI staff forecast suggests that manufacturing investment will be up by more than 8 per cent in 1986. The critical point, of course, is that I am confident that the tax allowances for investment, particularly after the refinements this year—we are not discussing the short life assets of clause 54, which we have already done on the Floor of the House—remain adequate. They compare well with those in the generality of overseas regimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crucial to investment intent and planning that profits are up by over 20 per cent in 1984 and still rising. There is no reason on that basis to expect a major downturn in investment after the transitional period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) and Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) specifically asked about the problems of the regions and regional investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I forgive a person who cannot understand the tax system. Much of the ethos behind our corporation tax changes is to try to stop the tax system being a way in which one can distort investment intentions to try to improve overall economic performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the ways in which the governmental system, whether tax or grants, helps manufacturing, which is the area to which the hon. Member for Workington and the hon. Member for Stretford referred. In so far as there is a tilt in any direction, post-Budget changes are continuing the consequentials, and on this occasion they are specifically in favour of manufacturing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three basic areas. There are capital allowances for industrial buildings but not for commercial buildings; most assistance for exports goes largely to manufactured exports; and industrial support is largely to manufacturing. I would continue, but I have the distinct feeling that the hon. Member for Workington wishes to say something.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister ever has the good fortune to find himself in a position, for example, where he could seek an investigation and set up an inquiry into the question of regionalising the corporate tax system, can I ask him to do so in case it might happen at some time in the near future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I had better pass rapidly on to the next point to which the hon. Member for Workington addressed us. That was about the note he had received from the CBI. I have no authority for documents issued by the CBI, but I do have responsibility for papers issued by the Inland Revenue. I noted, as all of my hon. Friends have noted, the CBI's concern about what it refers to as the "dip" in allowances in 1986-87.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If people examine the charts and arguments in more detail, they will realise that they put insufficient weight

	<span class='label label-info column'>395</span>
on the benefits, for example, of tax rate cuts and the abolition of NIS, which was welcomed by all of my right honourable and hon. Friends. Therefore, I see no clear case for a general relaxation in the 1984 transitional provisions, providing that we also recognise the notable refinement this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that he does not believe the CBI and that it has not done its homework properly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was careful to say that I could not express a view about the basis on which other organisations produced their papers. I simply said that I thought that the picture expressed was incomplete and, earlier, I said what I thought the DTI's and the CBI's investment intentions were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1984 changes establish the basic principles that the Government saw as the rationale for the 1984 capital allowance changes. We hope that companies will be encouraged to find projects which are commercially viable rather than more tax efficient, that the reduction in capital allowances will substantially reduce the artificial incentive to replace labour with machinery and plant which is a very important objective—and that the reduction in high nominal rates will mean that successful companies will no longer be penalised and can grow. On that basis, I hope that the Committee will allow the clause to stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can all judge the Financial Secretary's answers. To me, they have all the credibility of the average Conservative party political broadcast, and we know how those are worked out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found the Financial Secretary's reasons for the change most peculiar. He told us that the corporation tax system did not work well, and I agree with that. I am not entirely sure why capital allowances should therefore be abolished. Most extraordinary of all were his reasons why it was thought that capital allowances were not working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He said that investment in British industry was less than in other countries, which is true. The idea that capital allowances were the cause of that struck me as bizarre. It has nothing to do with capital allowances. It has more to do with the pursuit of monetarist policies, which have deflated the British economy and wrecked vast parts of manufacturing industry. Incentives to invest in British industry are said not to have produced a great boom in investment. But why should they therefore be abolished? That is an illogicality of which I did not think even the Government were capable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Low investment is not a reason for withdrawing incentives to invest. It may be a reason for considering different ways in which to build up industry. It is very clear to me and my hon. Friends why Britain is performing worse than our competitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving aside the oil industry, Britain's manufacturing investment is still 25 per cent below what it was in 1979. That is inescapably the result of Government policy. As the CBI says, much recent investment has been in replacement, not in new capacity, and it is the latter which will revive industry and increase jobs. It is clear from our exchanges with the Financial Secretary that there will be a decent investment policy only when there is a decent Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Board of Inland Revenue's notes on clauses, which have been most helpful to the Committee, state in the summary that clause 53
	<br><blockquote><p>"is designed to bring the date when expenditure is incurred for capital allowances purposes into line with the date on which it is treated as incurred for normal accountancy purposes."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Committee appreciates that clarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4 of the notes states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subsection (2) is the substance of the new definition. Expenditure is to be regarded as having been incurred for capital allowances purposes when the obligation to pay becomes unconditional."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 134 is a probing amendment to ask the Financial Secretary to explain the thinking behind that statement. Some expenditure is regarded as incurred for normal accountancy purposes when the obligation to pay is still conditional. Therefore my remarks concern certain items of expenditure which appear to fall outside the purposes and description of the clause. Perhaps I can explain to the Committee what I have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am addressing myself to larger companies which have contracted for large projects—petrochemical complexes or large processing plants are a good example. I am thinking of instances that would involve such companies. For most circumstances of capital expenditure—perhaps even 99 per cent—the clause is admirable and the new provisions are greatly welcomed. The majority of companies will order new plant and equipment and be supplied. They will receive an invoice, pay it and get a capital allowance when the obligation to pay becomes unconditional.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some large companies, however, undertake construction of a plant over a period, and completion may take place in stages. It may be billed and paid for and accounted under the books of account in stages, under normally accepted accounting principles as an asset in the accounts of the company, but the obligation to pay has still not become unconditional. It may not become so until the project has been completed and the different parts of the petrochemical complex are in place and working correctly. Therefore, the company which has incurred the expenditure has no right of redress against the supplier. Indeed, his obligation has become unconditional.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0741">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>397</span>
I suggest—I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would help me—that normal accounting principles should be employed for this clause, meaning that in cases where the obligation had not become unconditional, capital allowances—I stress that they are very limited—would be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the related amendment No. 135. Some projects, especially very large capital-intensive projects, even after the final date when obligation becomes unconditional, can involve payments which may be made three, six or even 12 months after the unconditional obligation. It is a fact of commercial life that suppliers of domestic equipment are stretching out their payment terms in order to win orders in the first place. Amendment No. 135 merely suggests extending the three-month provision in the clause to 12 months. I submit that 12 months is the normal distinction between a current liability and a long-term liability. If a supplier has said, "OK, for the last part of the payment on this plant after completion and after the obligation becomes unconditional, I shall give you 12 months' grace"— typically without interest—the ability to claim capital allowances should be at the moment when the original obligation arises, as suggested in amendment No. 134, or, as the clause is drafted, at the moment when the obligation becomes unconditional, but allowing for a delay at the final stage of payment of up to 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful for the Financial Secretary's help. I welcome the measure, as I do clause 52, which must be read with this clause. They are welcome provisions. They help industry substantially by bringing forward in general, the time when capital allowances can be taken and they are simple to understand. However, I should be grateful for the Financial Secretary's clarification of the measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr John Marek	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Freeman). I shall be even more interested in the Minister's answers. Very large companies, such as those involved in petrochemicals, might genuinely be disadvantaged because they would have to lay out a lot of capital and perhaps have to wait a long time before they could claim their allowances. As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) says, it is often the other way round. In that respect I am pleased that subsections (3) and (4) seek to preserve the position so that companies cannot claim allowances well in advance of having to pay or to undertake the capital costs involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latest issue of CBI News has a headline which says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Here they are: Our Finance Bill victories."</p></blockquote>
One of the victories cited is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Capital allowances—date on which expenditure is deemed to be Incurred: The rules governing the date on which capital expenditure was deemed to be incurred were reinterpreted in 1984. The CBI objected that this amounted to a revolutionary change in longstanding practice and would involve a disproportionate compliance burden. The CBI argued for continuation of the existing practice and this is largely given by clause 53 which aims to bring the date on which expenditure is incurred for capital allowance purposes into line with normal accountancy practice, although some problems remain to be resolved."</p></blockquote>
I wonder what and whose those problems are. Perhaps the hon. Member for Kettering can give us the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>398</span>
Basically, I am in favour of clause 53. By and large, it is sensible and it was introduced because the previous changes were a little too tight. On the other hand, because of subsections (3) and (4), it does not seek to threaten the changes too much. Therefore, I hope that we shall let it become part of the Finance Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tatton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak briefly to amendment No. 143, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Hirst), who, alas, cannot be with us because he has had to leave to dress for dinner. I am sure that hon. Members will share my sense of relief that among the 1983 Tory intake there are a few gents, contrary to the derogatory aspersions cast upon us by my hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Critchley) in his recent book, for which he has been widely rebuked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Freeman) has covered the major points to which the amendments to the clause relate, but he did not cover the point that the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden sought to make. I refer to the case for retention of payments, whereby sums are retained under a contract against its satisfactory performance in due course. I understand that such sums could be treated as instalment payments, in which case they would be eligible for capital allowances only at the time when they became due and payable. My hon. Friend considers that such sums should be treated for tax purposes as they are for accountancy purposes, as being paid when the principal part of the expenditure is incurred rather than when they are actually paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point is analagous to that and it should be drawn to the Committee's attention. I refer to target or milestone payments which are payable only at certain points in a contract. Again, there may be difficulty in ascertaining when the legal obligation to pay arises. Indeed, performance payments, which I mentioned a moment ago, may never arise and become legally eligible. Therefore, there may well be an ambiguity which should be cleared up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kettering said that he thought about 99 per cent of contracts would be perfectly all right under the provisions in the Bill as they now stand. However, I have heard other estimates which suggest that perhaps 75 per cent of contracts would be perfectly all right under the clause as it stands. That relates to the numbers of contracts, but, when one considers contracts by value, so that the sort of circumstances that my hon. Friend outlined are taken into account, perhaps only about 50 per cent of them will be covered. That point should be borne in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem of clause 53 arises from the view taken by the Inland Revenue of when capital expenditure is incurred. For a long time, the practice was that the expenditure was treated as being incurred roughly when the invoice was issued and when the debt became payable. An invoice might be issued on terms of payment within, say, 30 days. Therefore, under the Revenue ruling, the issuing of the invoice and the incurring of the capital expenditure could occur in one tax year while the payment might be made in the next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some ways, understandably, the Revenue thought that the incurring of the expenditure should be on the same day as the requirement to pay. Therefore, when an invoice had a 30-day net payment period, the capital expenditure was incurred when the 30 days were up and not when it was issued. As I understand it, the provision restates the position that had been understood by companies and accountants by introducing a distinction—which I find legally difficult, but it is probably the only way to proceed—between the obligation to pay and the requirement to pay. In other words, the date on which the obligation to pay fructifies may be different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
Our amendments relate to the anti-avoidance provisions. Once there is a distinction between the obligation to pay and the date on which there is a requirement to pay, clearly there is scope for abuse; my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) drew attention to that. In essence, subsections (3) and (4) are anti-avoidance provisions and cover circumstances when there is a desire to accelerate a claim as a result of the distinction in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsection (3), an invoice could be issued with a very long period of credit being extended. Although the benefit of the capital expenditure would be received at a certain date, the payment in respect of which the allowance was claimed might not be made until much later. Subsection (4) covers the position when there is a requirement to pay at a certain time, with the obligation to pay being put at an artificially early date so as to claim capital allowance then. We support both subsections in principle, as they try to prevent tax avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with amendment No. 134 is that it fails to take sufficient account of the fact that the obligation to pay would have to be unconditional for any sense to be made of the distinction drawn in clause 53, on which the clause is based.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
